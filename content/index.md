# Welcome, this is not a file cabinet

Welcome internet traveller, how did you find your way here?

This isn't really a public cabinet. I don't have much to offer you, but I'm glad you're here.

This is a cabinet full of my thoughts, my ideas, my projects, my work, my life.

It's kinda private, but hey you somehow found it.

Most of the private or stuff I just don't want to show are stripped. This is a not a full representation of my Obsidian vault, it is just cool to put some onto a website.


This vault's notes are not atomic notes, at least not for school notes. However, they still do have links between them, just not so 'single idea'ed, if I have time I will divide them up.

\* Unless explicitly mentioned or expected (ex. homework), not all text here should be taken as my work, some might be taken from presentations or online and compiled together. An example would be copying text from a presentation or website then rewriting or adding info on top of it or summarizing the whole thing or practice writing LaTeX with it. At most there will be AI summaries of articles or pieces acted on with AI feedback.

\* Unless explicitly allowed, please refrain from sharing this Github Pages link. However, you can share the content.

\* I am not responsible for anything written here or any harm caused to someone reading what is written here. 
Said text here is not actual representation of me or what I write, said text is provided "AS IS". 
By viewing this vault, you agree to that: In no event shall I be held responsible or liable to any claim, damages, or other liabilities.

\* Most stuff not from `02_areas` or `03_resources` have been removed.

\* I am too lazy to add proper light mode styling as I will only be using dark mode. The styling on this website is a one to one replica of how my Obsidian vault looks like but without custom callouts and stuff.
