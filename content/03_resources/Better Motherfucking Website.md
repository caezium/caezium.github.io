The key points are: simple CSS, readability, accessibility, and practical web design advice.

  
The “Better Motherfucking Website” page delivers blunt, satirical advice on web design, emphasizing that making a website readable and accessible is easy and requires minimal CSS. Here are the main takeaways:

- **Minimal CSS for Big Impact**: The site claims only 7 CSS declarations are needed to vastly improve readability and appearance compared to default browser styles. Ask Dia Hyperlink: CSS
- **Readability Matters**: Use a minimum ‎⁠line-height: 1.4⁠ for body text to improve legibility and avoid cramped lines. Headings should have tighter spacing.
- **Proper Margins**: Don’t let text touch the edges of the browser window—add padding or margins so content can “breathe.”
- **Reduce Contrast**: Avoid pure black text on a white background; use softer colors for less eye strain.
- **Font Size**: Body text should be at least 16px for comfortable reading on screens.
- **Optimal Line Width**: Keep lines of text between 60–80 characters wide to prevent eye strain and make content easier to read.
- **Accessibility and Consistency**: The site remains lightweight, fast, accessible, and looks the same across browsers and devices.
- **Satirical Tone**: The advice is delivered with humor and profanity, poking fun at bad web design and default browser styles.

  

The overall message: making a website readable, accessible, and pleasant is simple, and there’s no excuse for ugly, hard-to-read sites.
