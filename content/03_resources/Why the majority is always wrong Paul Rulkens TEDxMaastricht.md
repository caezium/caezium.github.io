**1. The Purpose of Thinking**

  

Rulkens explains that the main purpose of thinking is not to follow the crowd, but to find better solutions and create value by thinking differently. He encourages questioning the status quo and not simply accepting what everyone else does. 



**2. Mental Myopia**

  

He discusses “mental myopia,” or the tendency to focus only on what is immediately in front of us. This narrow thinking leads people to make decisions based on what the majority does, rather than considering alternative, potentially better options. 

  

**3. Industry Standards and Mediocrity**

  

Rulkens points out that industry standards are often just averages, and following them means settling for mediocrity. He argues that true innovation and success come from challenging these standards and thinking outside the box. 

  

**4. The Power of Being Different**

  

He emphasizes that the most successful people and organizations are those who dare to be different and take calculated risks, rather than simply following the majority.

  

**5. Practical Application**

  

Rulkens encourages the audience to actively seek out ways to do things differently in their own lives and work, suggesting that this is the path to achieving big goals in the easiest, fastest, and most elegant way possible.

  

In summary, Paul Rulkens’ talk is a call to challenge conventional wisdom, avoid the trap of majority thinking, and pursue unique approaches for greater success.




Paul Rulkens’ talk centers on the idea that following the majority leads to average, not extraordinary, results. He argues that if you want to achieve something exceptional—whether in business, creativity, or personal growth—you must break away from what everyone else is doing and think outside the box. The majority, by definition, is not extraordinary; it is average. Therefore, practices embraced by the majority will only yield average outcomes.

**Key Points from the Talk** 

- **The Purpose of Thinking**: Rulkens explains that thinking is meant to help us find new solutions, not just repeat what’s already been done. Most people, however, default to “automatic pilot,” repeating familiar actions and staying within their comfort zones. ​⁠
- **Mental Myopia**: He describes how people develop tunnel vision, focusing only on what’s immediately in front of them and missing opportunities outside their usual boundaries. ​⁠
- **Industry Standards**: Rulkens points out that industry norms are just averages. If you follow them, you’ll get average results. True innovation comes from challenging these standards. ​⁠
- **Breaking Out of the Box**: He encourages recognizing the boundaries—legal, moral, technological—that shape our thinking, and then deliberately seeking ideas outside those boundaries.
- **Extraordinary Results**: Only about 3% of people achieve extraordinary results by daring to be different, while the remaining 97% end up working for them.

**Insights from the Comments** 

- **Clarifying the Main Message**: Several commenters note that many viewers missed the point: the majority is “always wrong” not in a literal sense, but because the majority is never extraordinary. If you want to build a successful business or life, you can’t just copy what everyone else does—you must innovate and take risks.
- **Thinking Outside the Box—Explained**: Commenters appreciate that Rulkens doesn’t just say “think outside the box,” but actually explains how: by recognizing your boundaries and actively seeking ideas beyond them.
- **Resilience and Commitment**: One comment highlights that having a brilliant idea is just the start. To succeed, you need the passion and resilience to keep going, even when others doubt you or reject your ideas. Many successful people in history faced this challenge.
- **Reflection and Caution**: Some comments reference quotes like Mark Twain’s “When you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect,” reinforcing the talk’s message about questioning conformity.
- **Nuance and Risk**: A thoughtful comment points out that doing things differently doesn’t guarantee success—it can also lead to failure. The key is to be willing to take risks and learn from them, rather than blindly following the crowd.

**Overall Takeaway** 

The talk, supported by the comments, is a call to action: if you want to achieve more than average, you must be willing to challenge norms, think differently, and persist in the face of skepticism. The majority’s path leads to mediocrity; extraordinary results require extraordinary thinking and courage.
