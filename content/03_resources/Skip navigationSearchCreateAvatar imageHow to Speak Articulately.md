**1. Articulation CAN Be Improved**

  

The video opens by emphasizing that anyone can become more articulate with practice and intention. Articulation is not an innate talent but a skill that can be developed. 

  

**2. Embrace Silence**

  

Pausing and allowing silence in your speech helps you gather your thoughts and speak more clearly. Silence is not something to fear; it gives your words more weight and helps avoid filler words. 

  

**3. Build a Knowledge Base**

  

Being articulate is easier when you have a strong foundation of knowledge. Read widely, learn deeply, and expose yourself to new ideas so you have more to draw from when you speak. 

  

**4. Journal for Clarity**

  

Writing regularly helps clarify your thoughts. Journaling allows you to process ideas, organize your thinking, and express yourself more precisely when speaking. 

  

**5. Leave Room for Inner Dialogue**

  

Allow yourself time to reflect and think before responding. This inner dialogue helps you articulate your thoughts more clearly and avoid speaking impulsively. 

  

**6. Talk to the Voices**

  

Acknowledge and converse with the different “voices” or perspectives in your mind. This practice helps you understand your own thoughts better and communicate them more effectively. 

  

These strategies together can help anyone become a more articulate and confident speaker.
