## Summary
This content is a highly opinionated and expletive-laden satirical critique of default browser styles and web design practices. It argues that with minimal CSS (specifically, seven declarations), websites can be significantly improved for readability, while retaining their core benefits like being lightweight, responsive, and accessible. The author encourages web designers to make simple adjustments to line-height, contrast, font size, and line-width to enhance user experience, emphasizing that default styles are often 'ugly' and hinder readability.

## Key Points
- **Minimal Effort for Improvement:** It takes very few CSS declarations (e.g., 7) to drastically improve a website's readability.
- **Retains Core Benefits:** Improved sites can still be lightweight, fast, responsive, cross-browser compatible, and accessible.
- **Key Readability Improvements:**
    - **Line-height:** Use a minimum of 1.4 for body copy; headings should be tighter.
    - **Spacing/Padding:** Ensure text doesn't hit the side of the browser; provide breathing room.
    - **Contrast:** Tone down harsh black-on-white contrast (e.g., use `#EEEEEE` for background).
    - **Font Size:** Body copy should be 16px or larger for screen readability.
    - **Line-width:** Keep lines to 60-80 characters for easier reading, avoiding overly long lines.
- **Satirical Tone:** The piece is explicitly satirical, using strong language to make its points about the simplicity of good web design principles.

# Original Content

## Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.

**7 fucking declarations.**

That's how much CSS it took to turn that [grotesque pile of shit](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it *still* has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:

- Shit's *still* lightweight and loads fast
- *Still* fits on all your shitty screens
- *Still* looks the same in all your shitty browsers
- The motherfucker's *still* accessible to every asshole that visits your site
- Shit's *still* legible and gets your fucking point across

### And guess what, motherfucker:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.

## Let it breathe

Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum `line-height: 1.4` for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.

## A little less contrast

Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice `#EEEEEE` if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.

## Size Matters

I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.

## Line-width, motherfucker

Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.

### Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck

I love what the creator of [this site's inspiration](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
