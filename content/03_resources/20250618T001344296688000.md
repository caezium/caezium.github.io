## Key Points

### Definition
- Dopamine loading involves delaying high-dopamine activities until after completing study/work sessions
- Contrasts with common habit of engaging in stimulating activities before work

### Main Arguments
1. Morning dopamine spikes from social media/entertainment make subsequent work harder
2. Saving rewarding activities for after work maintains better focus
3. Brain's contrast mechanism makes work feel easier when not competing with high-dopamine activities

### Recommended Implementation
- Start day with basic routines (shower, sunlight)
- Avoid phone and entertainment before work
- Keep meals light and low-carb during work periods
- Reserve high-dopamine activities as post-work rewards

### Claimed Benefits
- Improved focus during study sessions
- Enhanced motivation
- More efficient work completion
- Better daily structure
- Sustainable productivity habits
