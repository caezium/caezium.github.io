# Net Negative AI Code Generation - Cursor Editor Case Study

An analysis of how AI-assisted development tools can potentially reduce productivity rather than enhance it, using Cursor editor as a case study.

## Key Points

1. AI-generated code can be worse than useless, making developers "net-negative productive"

2. Problems with AI Code Generation:
   - Can generate technically correct but practically useless code (e.g., validating u16 against its maximum possible value)
   - Makes decisions without providing context or rationale
   - Can introduce subtle bugs that require significant effort to identify and fix
   - May require more effort to review and fix than writing code manually

3. Example Issues from Cursor Editor:
   - Added useless length validation that could never trigger (comparing u16 against its max value)
   - Implemented questionable character sanitization without considering full implications
   - Generated code that would trigger compiler warnings
   - Created inefficient implementations (unnecessary allocations)

4. Core Issue: Decision Making
   - Programming involves many decisions, both large and small
   - AI tools often make decisions without explaining rationale
   - Some decisions can be safely automated, but many require careful consideration
   - Current AI tools (as of 2025) don't effectively distinguish between these cases

## Implications

- AI tools need to better identify which decisions need human review
- Tools should provide context for decision-making rather than just suggesting changes
- Speed of code generation is less important than quality of decisions
- Review effort for AI-generated code can exceed effort of writing code manually
