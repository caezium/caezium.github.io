## Summary
The University of Oxford provides guidance on the ethical and effective use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) to support student learning. It emphasizes that while AI can assist in developing academic skills like reading and writing, it cannot replace critical thinking or the development of scholarly arguments. The guidance stresses the importance of ethical use, proper attribution to avoid plagiarism, and the necessity of critically appraising AI outputs for accuracy and potential biases. It offers practical tips for using AI in academic reading, writing, language study, and coding, alongside warnings about AI's limitations and the need to follow specific departmental instructions.

## Key Points
- **AI as a Support Tool**: Generative AI tools can support academic skills development (reading, writing, language, coding) but cannot replace human critical thinking or the core learning process.
- **Ethical Use & Plagiarism**: Students must use AI ethically, practice proper note-taking and attribution, and understand that unauthorized AI use falls under plagiarism regulations. Acknowledge AI use when authorized.
- **Critical Appraisal**: Always cross-check AI-generated outputs for accuracy, identify erroneous information, and verify against established sources.
- **Contextual Prompts**: Provide significant context and follow-up questions to refine AI responses.
- **Limitations**: AI tools are not perfect; they can fabricate information, reflect biases, be out of date, and are not good at calculations. Outputs are not repeatable.
- **Specific Guidance**: Students must always follow specific guidance from their tutors, supervisors, departments, or faculties regarding AI tool usage.
- **Skill Development**: AI can help with tasks like summarizing papers (for comparison), generating thought-provoking questions, providing writing feedback (grammar/structure, not academic rigor), aiding in language study, and supporting coding skills (for comparison/learning, not assessment).

### Overview

Part of what a university education teaches is certain academic skills, such as assimilating information, constructing an evidence-based argument and expressing your thoughts in clear, coherent prose.

AI tools cannot replace human critical thinking or the development of scholarly evidence-based arguments and subject knowledge that forms the basis of your university education.

You can make use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Bing Chat and Google Bard) in developing your academic skills to support your studies. Your ongoing critical appraisal of outputs by reviewing them for accuracy will maximise the potential for AI outputs to be a useful additional tool to support you in your studies.

In some instances academic staff, departments and colleges may give more detailed guidance on how they expect AI tools to be used (or not used) for different tasks or on specific assignments. You should always follow the guidance of your tutors, supervisors and department or faculty.
