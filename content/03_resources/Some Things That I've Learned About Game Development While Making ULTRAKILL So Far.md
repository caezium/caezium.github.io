The video shares practical lessons and advice on indie game development from the creator of ULTRAKILL.

  

Here are the main points covered in the talk, organized by topic and timestamp for easy reference:

  

**Introduction & Background**

- The speaker, Hakita, is the lead developer of ULTRAKILL, sharing advice for aspiring game developers based on personal experience and lessons learned from peers. 

  

**Starting Out**

- **Pick an Engine and Start:** The choice of engine (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.) matters less than actually starting and experimenting. 
- **Start Small:** Make small games before attempting a big project. This builds experience and helps avoid burnout. 
- **Set Deadlines:** Strict deadlines help prevent scope creep and teach you to finish projects. 
- **Collaborate:** Working with others is usually better than going completely solo, as game development is a huge undertaking. 
- **Build Connections:** Network with peers and be a pleasant collaborator; people prefer working with those they get along with. 

  

**Making the Game**

- **Focus on the Core Gameplay Loop:** Make sure the main activity in your game is fun, as this is what players will do most. 
- **Sound is Crucial:** Add sound effects early; they are fundamental to how a game feels. 
- **Expect Delays:** Everything takes longer than you think—plan for this. 
- **“Good Enough” is Often Enough:** Don’t get stuck perfecting things; finishing is more important. 
- **Back Up Your Work:** Use version control (like Git) or at least regular backups. 
- **Avoid Multiplayer (Unless Experienced):** Multiplayer adds significant complexity and is not recommended for beginners. 

  

**Game Design Advice**

- **“Close Enough” is Enough:** Be generous with things like hitboxes; players blame the game if they “almost” succeed. 
- **Memorable Levels:** Each level should have at least one memorable feature. 
- **Exaggerate Audio for Impact:** Make sounds feel impactful, not just realistic. 
- **Guide, Don’t Force:** Encourage fun playstyles but allow player expression. 
- **Multiple Solutions:** Give players more than one way to solve problems. 
- **Frame Challenges as Opportunities:** Present mechanics as giving opportunities, not taking them away. 
- **Responsive Controls:** Player input should be responded to instantly for a satisfying feel. 
- **Use Calm to Make Intensity Stand Out:** Alternate intense and calm moments for better pacing. 

  

**Writing & Music**

- **Strong Beginnings and Endings:** These are the most important parts of a story. 
- **Leave Some Questions Unanswered:** Ambiguity can make stories more interesting. 
- **Cut Unnecessary Content:** Shorter, more focused writing is usually better. 
- **Music Should Avoid Excessive Repetition:** Since game music loops, avoid repetitive motifs. 
- **Get Weird with Soundtracks:** Games allow for more experimental music than other media. 

  

**Iteration & Feedback**

- **Playtest Constantly:** Regularly play your own game to spot issues. 
- **Learn to Take Feedback:** Filter suggestions through your vision, but don’t ignore them. 
- **Study Good and Bad Games:** Learn from both successes and failures, even outside your genre. 
- **No Universal Rules:** Every design decision is context-dependent. 

  

**Marketing & Releasing**

- **Start Marketing Early:** Build an audience from the beginning, using platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Discord. 
- **Demos Are Powerful:** A good demo can drive word of mouth and sales. 
- **Target the Right Influencers:** Focus on streamers/YouTubers with audiences interested in your genre. 
- **Set Up a Steam Page Early:** Start collecting wishlists as soon as your game looks presentable. 
- **Foster a Healthy Community:** Early, welcoming communities help your game grow. 
- **Don’t Badmouth Others Publicly:** It can hurt your reputation and opportunities. 

  

**Finishing & Beyond**

- **Finishing is Hard:** The last 10% of development is the toughest. 
- **Polish and Consistency:** Do a final pass to ensure the game feels cohesive. 
- **Early Access Can Help:** It provides feedback and financial support for small teams. 
- **Understand Taxes:** Be prepared for the business side of releasing a commercial game.
