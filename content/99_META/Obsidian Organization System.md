**EXPERIMENTATION**
experiment with how I feel about this


subject folders in areas
1,2,3,4...,n for chapter folder
inside individual lessons/big ideas eg 1.1,1.2 but file name no nums
MOC with the nums





-desk setup document seems like something i would want to keep but not in the projects folder nor the areas folder nor the permanent. solution: could remain in projects folder when adjusting stuff or needs to be adjusted, and move into a “p”ersonal folder in permanent.

want to make a siege skin wishlist dk if it belongs in fleeting or permanent. ok it should be in fleeting

how do I make file bar less messy?
more folders?
MOC

usage of the #todo tag?


resources ex. video paraphrased/key notes. general resources such as books, websites
permanent ex. G1 stuff (one note that links to resources such as book you can use in G1, ECAs)
or  in MOC?

ECAs, school items in Areas.

ZETTELKASTEN
_fleeting
literature
permanent

fleeting- your fleeting thoughts
	thoughts and ideas throughout your day
	keep tract of your thoughts
	can be built on later

literature- wow, your notes can never be literature, so... (but maybe it can)
	resources that you want to keep but it's not yours (articles, books, videos, etc..)
	stuff you learned/summarized/taken out of those resources
	can be used for linking/citing later

permanent- will they be permanent though?? well they are digital ones and zeros in the clouds so it's probably more permanent than paper
	refined combination of your fleeting and literature notes
	!you can reference your notes across each other!
	lasting value, key concepts, theories, or ideas



Maps of Content
	linking stuff so you can access them quickly
	navigational aids/note hierarchy
