Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate.
=="Better note-taking" misses the point; what matters is "better thinking"==
##### Evergreen notes should be atomic
it is best to create notes which are only about one thing, but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing
this way it is easier to form connects across topics and contexts
atomicity  fosters re-use which in turn multiplies the amount of connections in your second brain
##### Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
write notes by concept rather than author, event, book, or topic
this way concepts can be linked and expanded upon
##### Evergreen notes should be densely linked
helps you internalize the ideas more deeply
## **Write the notes for yourself, rather than the 'audience'**
