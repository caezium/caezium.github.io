you can add math expressions to your notes using MathJax and the LaTeX notation.
To add a MathJax expression to your note, surround it with double dollar signs `$$`.
ex.
```
$$
\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$
```
$$
\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$
you can also inline math expressions by wrapping it in dollar sign `$` symbols.
ex.
`This is an inline math expression $e^{2i\pi} = 1$.`
This is an inline math expression $e^{2i\pi} = 1$.
