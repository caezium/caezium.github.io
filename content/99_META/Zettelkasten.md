There are 4 main different types of notes:
1. **Fleeting**
	These are for quick notes that capture in-the-moment ideas. 
	Capture our thoughts so that you can refine them later.
2. **Literature**
	Capture key points from resources.
	==Remember to keep each literature note a single idea==, as opposed to a collection of learnings from what you read.
3. **Permanent**
	These are notes that you want to keep long-term.
	Made up of the notes you've *grouped/connected together.*
	a **summarization** of your ideas.
4. **Reference**
	"*Connectors*" within your note box. 
	table of content/legend
	ex. a label to mark notes that came from the same book.
