you can modify the Obsidian appearance by using CSS.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language used to describe how to present a HTML document. By adding CSS snippets, you can redefine parts of the Obsidian user interface, such as the size and color of headings. 
CSS is the same markup language used for websites and web-based apps.


### Obsidian includes hundreds of [CSS variables](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/CSS+variables) that you can use to customize the interface.
