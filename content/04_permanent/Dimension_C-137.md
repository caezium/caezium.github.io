**Dimension C-137** is one of the many universes in the multiverse was born and grew up. This is one of many dimensions where Rick's wife [Diane](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Diane_Sanchez "Diane Sanchez") and daughter [Beth](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Beth_Sanchez_(C-137) "Beth Sanchez (C-137)")were killed when Beth was a child, and as a result, [Summer](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Summer_Smith "Summer Smith")and [Morty](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Morty_Smith "Morty Smith") never existed. Before it was revealed that the Rick and Morty we follow in the show are each from different dimensions, "Dimension C-137" was thought, including by Morty himself, to refer to the [Prime Dimension](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Dimension "Prime Dimension") where our Morty originated and the first six episodes of the TV series took place.

Rick returns to this dimension in "[Solaricks](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Solaricks "Solaricks")", where it is revealed he kept the entire dimension on a time loop of the day he lost Beth and Diane, leaving its inhabitants trapped for decades. As part of his effort to move on, Rick gets rid of the time loop, giving his neighbor Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian, and likely most of Earth's population, the relief of death.

They say my mind is held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.

The “time loop” suggests that the person is mentally and emotionally trapped, constanly reliving the trauma.
The “formidable intelligence” symbolizes the overwhelming power of the traumatic memory or the mind’s coping mechanism, which keeps the person stuck in that moment, unable to move on.
The mention of the “captor” forgetting about aging indicates that while the mind or soul remain trapped in the past, the physical body continues to deteriorate with time, enduring life under such relentless psychological strain.
The imagery of being “caught like a fly in amber” evokes a sense of being preserved in a state of suspended animation, unable to escape or progress, always fixed on that memory. The trauma encases and immobilizes the soul.  (amber is a fossilized tree resin that can preserve small creatures that became stuck in it for millions of years)
The mental imprisonment, the inescapable nature of trauma, and the longing for release from suffering.
