ethical weighing
moral calculus
benefit-cost analysis
there are lies, damned lies, and statistics lmao
### The Ethical Algorithm
relative worth of different outcomes.
In the scientific literature, these **estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks** are often referred to as the "value of a statistical life.”

constant and a variable
ex.
constant is the work you do, it has value, and it will be compromised if the person goes to jail
variable, Value of Statistical Life

the person's VSL versus the witness's VSL.
the witness's VSL is lower, so its justified to kill her because the person will be greater for society in some terms.


*you can't put a price on a life*
every department in our government has a VSL

EPA's is $10 million
FDA's is $7.9 million

The Department of Transportation's is $6.4 million

take the DOT as an example, the annoying beep that goes off when the people in the front seat don't put their seatbelts on? ever wonder why there was no beep for the people sitting in the back? 
It would cost them $325 million a year, but only save 44 lives.
325 divided by 44 is $7.4 million
But since DOT values each life at only $6.4 million, they do not do that.

another example
organ recipient protocols
what a teacher makes versus a hedge fund manager.

another example could be a boss of a company, although the boss provides jobs to 10,000+ people, an environmental activist could have almost the same VSL as the boss as the environmental activist has a significantly less carbon footprint than the boss, as the boss uses private jets all the time. the environmental activists also gives and brings hope to younger generations, preserving our world and just uplifting people. for the boss's VSL to go over the environmental activists's hope/uplifting VSL, the boss just needs to make more money.

another example is SCIE, we do not have curtains to cover the windows in the event of an active shooter. Because the probability of a school shooter in China is very low, to spend the money to add curtains to cover the windows would mean that each student's VSL is more than $1 billion. We are probably not, so they do not install curtains. If they do, it would be a stupid waste of money however little.

other factors for VSL can be jobs for other people, knowledge, hope, carbon footprint

It is a surprisingly easy calculation.
It's the ethical thing to do.










The prevention of injury, illness, and loss of life significantly impacts many private economic decisions, such as job choices and consumer product purchases. When the government invests directly or regulates market impacts, it aims to achieve these safety benefits, though often at societal costs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and its administrations must assess the monetary costs and benefits of their regulations and actions to ensure responsible public service.

| VSL /million $ | Base Year |

| 13.2           | 2023      |
| 12.5           | 2022      |
| 11.8           | 2021      |
| 11.6           | 2020      |
| 10.9           | 2019      |
| 10.5           | 2018      |
| 10.2           | 2017      |
| 9.9            | 2016      |
| 9.6            | 2015      |
| 9.4            | 2014      |
| 9.2            | 2013      |
| 9.1            | 2012      |
The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) is used to quantify the benefit-cost of preventing fatalities.
This concept often causes confusion as it refers to valuing risk reductions, not life itself. But you can manipulate it to your own needs :)

#### The standard model
`V = pu(w) + (1-p)v(w)`
- p - probability of surviving the period
- u(w) - the utility of wealth `w` if he survives the period
- v(w) - the utility of wealth `w` if he dies (typically the utility of a bequest)
- assumptions are that `u>v` and are twice differentiable with `u'>v'>=0` and `v''<=0`
