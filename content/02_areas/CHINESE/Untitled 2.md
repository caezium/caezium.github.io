**Liu Bang** stationed his army at **Bashang** and had not yet met **Xiang Yu**. **Cao Wushang**, an official in charge of military affairs under Liu Bang, sent a messenger to Xiang Yu, saying: *"Liu Bang intends to proclaim himself King of Guanzhong, appoint Ziying as his chancellor, and seize all treasures for himself."* Enraged, Xiang Yu declared: *"Tomorrow, feast the soldiers! We shall crush Liu Bang’s army!"* At this time, Xiang Yu commanded 400,000 troops stationed at **Hongmen in Xinfeng**, while Liu Bang had only 100,000 men at Bashang.

  

**Fan Zeng**, Xiang Yu’s strategist, urged him: *"When the Duke of Pei (Liu Bang) was east of the Yao Mountains, he coveted wealth and indulged in women. Yet now, upon entering the Pass, he neither seizes riches nor pursues pleasure—this reveals grand ambitions. I had a diviner observe the aura above his camp: it took the form of dragons and tigers, radiant with five colors—the aura of a Son of Heaven! Strike now, lest we lose this opportunity."*

  

**Xiang Bo**, Xiang Yu’s uncle and the Left Yin of Chu, who was friendly with **Zhang Liang** (then serving Liu Bang), secretly rode overnight to Liu Bang’s camp. He privately informed Zhang Liang: *"Join me in fleeing. Do not perish with them!"* Zhang Liang replied: *"I escorted the Duke of Pei into the Pass on behalf of the King of Han. To abandon him in crisis would betray righteousness. I must inform him."*

  

Zhang Liang reported everything to Liu Bang, who panicked: *"What shall I do?"* Zhang Liang asked: *"Who advised you to blockade Hangu Pass?"* Liu Bang answered: *"A fool told me: ‘Secure the Pass against the nobles, and all Qin lands will be yours.’ Thus I followed his plan."* Zhang Liang pressed: *"Can your forces match Xiang Yu’s?"* After a long silence, Liu Bang admitted: *"No. What now?"* Zhang Liang proposed: *"Let me explain to Xiang Bo that you dare not defy Xiang Yu."*

  

When Liu Bang learned of Xiang Bo’s prior friendship with Zhang Liang (who once saved Xiang Bo from execution during Qin rule), he insisted on hosting Xiang Bo as an elder brother. Liu Bang toasted Xiang Bo, proposed a marriage alliance between their families, and explained: *"I entered Guanzhong without taking a single possession—I registered officials and citizens, sealed treasuries, and await Lord Xiang’s arrival. The Hangu Pass garrison was only to guard against bandits. How could I rebel? Please convey my loyalty to Xiang Yu."* Xiang Bo agreed and advised Liu Bang: *"Apologize personally to Xiang Yu at dawn tomorrow."*

  

Xiang Bo returned to camp and persuaded Xiang Yu: *"Liu Bang secured Guanzhong for you. Attacking him now would be dishonorable. Treat him kindly instead."* Xiang Yu consented.

  

The next morning, Liu Bang arrived at Hongmen with over 100 horsemen and apologized: *"You fought north of the Yellow River; I fought south. I never expected to enter Guanzhong first and destroy Qin. Now, slander has divided us."* Xiang Yu revealed: *"Your officer Cao Wushang said this. Else, why would I be angry?"*

  

During the banquet, Xiang Yu and Xiang Bo sat facing east; **Fan Zeng** (honored as "Second Father") faced south; Liu Bang faced north; Zhang Liang attended facing west. Fan Zeng repeatedly signaled Xiang Yu by raising his jade *jue* (a broken-ring symbolizing decisive action), but Xiang Yu ignored him. Fan Zeng then summoned **Xiang Zhuang** (a swordsman): *"Our lord is too merciful. Toast Liu Bang, then pretend to perform a sword dance and kill him!"*

  

Xiang Zhuang entered, toasted, and requested to entertain with swordplay. Xiang Yu approved. As Xiang Zhuang danced with drawn sword, **Xiang Bo** rose to join, shielding Liu Bang with his own body and blocking all assassination attempts.

  

Zhang Liang rushed to the camp gate for **Fan Kuai**, Liu Bang’s bodyguard. Fan Kuai demanded: *"How dire is it?"* Zhang Liang warned: *"Xiang Zhuang’s sword targets the Duke!"* Fan Kuai burst into the tent with sword and shield, knocking down guards. He glared at Xiang Yu, hair bristling, eyes wide.

  

Xiang Yu praised: *"A warrior! Give him wine and a pork leg!"* Fan Kuai drank the wine in one gulp, then ate the raw meat on his shield. When challenged to drink more, he retorted: *"I fear no death! The Qin tyrant slaughtered endlessly, so all rebelled. King Huai vowed: ‘He who enters Xianyang first shall rule Guanzhong.’ The Duke of Pei took Xianyang yet touched nothing, awaiting you. Instead of reward, you heed lies to kill him—this is to follow Qin’s cruelty!"*

  

Xiang Yu had no reply. Liu Bang excused himself to the latrine, taking Fan Kuai. Outside, he debated fleeing without formal farewell. Fan Kuai argued: *"Great deeds ignore trifles. We are fish on a chopping block—why courtesies?"* Liu Bang left secretly via Mount Li and the Zhiyang path with four guards, instructing Zhang Liang to present gifts: *"A pair of jade discs for Xiang Yu; jade cups for Fan Zeng."*

  

When Zhang Liang later presented the gifts, Xiang Yu accepted the discs. Fan Zeng smashed the cups in fury: *"Alas! Foolish boy! The empire will go to Liu Bang. We are all his captives now!"*

  

Upon returning to camp, Liu Bang immediately executed Cao Wushang for treason.
