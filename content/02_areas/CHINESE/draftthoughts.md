However, I found it to be quite quaint. Not perfect, but quaint.

The reason why this book isn’t perfect lies in how it was published originally — in serial form. Basically, whenever Dickens was backed into a corner that he didn’t like, he simply changed things mid-stream without needing to go back and revise the manuscript from the outset. Thus, we have a male narrator that disappears from the book about four chapters in because need of having the narrator around for all of the action didn’t suit the story — so off he went. (The disappearance is covered by Dickens in an appendix in a fashion that doesn’t make too much sense.) Same goes, I assume, for a marriage sub-plot surrounding Nell early on. It is mentioned, and then brushed aside for a different change of tactic.





The beginning of the book involves the Old Curiosity Shop but the shop itself has no real importance in the rest of the story. It serves as a connection point for many of the main characters but there is not much relevance to later events.



I loved to hate Quilp! He was such a dark and sinister character, purely motivated by revenge and schadenfreude. He stirred strong emotions in me - surely a sign of great writing.

I loved Kit and his family and his relationship with the Garlands. He somehow managed to be honest and wholesome without becoming too righteous or unsympathetic. He was the star of the show for me!

Sampson and Sally Brass and Dick Swiveller were also entertaining. Sally’s character was a bit of an enigma and the prevailing mystery of her relationship with Quilp and the Marchioness was a clever touch.

As usual, Dickens’ characters were wonderful - the folk Nell and her Grandfather met along the way were a great mix of comic, ill-intentioned or kind hearted. The portrayal of the countryside provided an interesting contrast with more heavily industrialised areas through which they travel and the different types of poverty and hardship witnessed in these different environments.

I think the Grandfather, and not Quilp, is the true villain of the story. Dickens does this sometimes: hides a villain to spring on the reader later.
trying his best, good intentions, but doesnt alter his actions and their consequences. It's the Grandfather's poor impulse control that puts himself and Nell into danger; it's their continual running away from his responsibility that leads, I think, to Nell's death. She's a consequence of, and a sacrifice to, the greed of her grandfather.
