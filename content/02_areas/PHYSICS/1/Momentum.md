> [!def] 
> An object with **[[Mass]]** that is in **[[Motion]]** has **momentum**
> $$momentum = mass \cdot velocity$$
> $$p = mv$$
- This means that an object at rest (i.e. _v_ = 0) has **no** momentum
- Momentum keeps an object moving in the same direction
	- It is difficult to change the direction of an object that has a large momentum

# **[[Conservation of Momentum]]**
> [!def]
> In a closed system, the total momentum before an event is equal to the total momentum after the event

# **[[Impulse]]**
When an *external resultant force acts* on an object for a **very short time** and changes the object's [[Motion]], we call this **[[Impulse]]**

[[Impulse]] is the **product** of the **force** applied and the **time** for which it acts
$$I = F\Delta t$$
so
$$I = \Delta p = \Delta mv = mv-mu$$

### Force and Momentum
Newton's second law is defined as
$$F=ma$$
Momentum is given by
$$p = mv$$
combining these two gives
$$F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
therefore, force can also be defined as the rate of change of momentum on an object
