## [[Motion]], [[Forces]], and [[Energy]]

---
#### 1.1 [[Physical properties quantities and measurement]]
![[IMG_5035.jpeg]]
- **[[Measurement]] Techniques**:
    - Use rulers with eyes perpendicular to the scale to **avoid parallax error**.
    - Measure [[liquid]] volumes using measuring cylinders at the **bottom meniscus**.
    - Use [[liquid]] **displacement** to measure volumes for **irregular** shaped objects
- **Time [[Measurement]]**:
    - clocks, stopwatches, or ticker timers.
- **[[02_areas/PHYSICS/00_General/Significant Figures]]**:
    - instrument **measurements d.p.** for accuracy.
    - calculation **2 or 3 [[02_areas/PHYSICS/00_General/Significant Figures]]**
	    - non-zero digits
	    - zeros between non-zero digits
	    - *zeros contain information on how much the number is rounded.*
- **Scalars vs. [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/vectors]]**:
    - Scalars: *Magnitude only* (e.g., [[mass]], [[energy]]).
    - [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/vectors]]: *Magnitude and direction* (e.g., [[velocity]], force).
    - [[Speed]] measures distance; [[velocity]] measures displacement.

#### 1.2 [[Motion]]
![[IMG_5036.jpeg]]
- **[[Speed]]**: Scalar quantity; distance traveled per unit time. $\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$
- **[[Velocity]]**: Vector quantity; [[speed]] with direction.  $\bar{v} = \frac{s}{t}$
- **[[Acceleration]]**: Rate of change of [[velocity]]; vector.  $a = \frac{v - u}{t}$
- **Graphs**:
    - Distance-Time: Gradient represents [[velocity]].
    - [[Speed]]-Time: Gradient represents [[acceleration]]; area under graph equals distance.
- **Freefall [[Acceleration]]**: $W = mg$, $g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$, $a = \frac{F}{m}$.

#### 1.3 [[Mass and Weight]]
![[00_MOC-20241102183433338.png]]
- **[[Mass]]** is a scalar **quantity** that reflects the **amount of [[matter]] in an object**, independent of location.
- **[[Weight]]**, being a force, varies with changes in gravitational pull and is therefore location-dependent.
- The formula `W = mg` illustrates the direct relationship between [[mass]] and [[weight]], linking them through the **[[acceleration]] due to gravity**.
- [[Weight]] is measured in **newtons**, while [[mass]] is measured in **kilograms**
- The distinction between [[mass]] and [[weight]] is crucial for various scientific applications, including physics and engineering.

#### 1.4 [[Density]]
![[00_MOC-20241102183453210.png]]
- **[[Density]]** is defined as [[mass]] per unit volume $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$
- **Volume** refers to the amount of space an object occupies.
- An object’s ability to **float or sink depends on its [[density]] relative to the fluid** it is in:
	- If the object is denser than the fluid, it sinks.
	- If the object is less dense than the fluid, it floats.

#### 1.5 [[Forces]]
![[00_MOC-20241102183520828.png]]
![[00_MOC-20241102183611179.png]]
- **[[Forces]] can change an object’s [[speed]], direction, shape, or size.**
	- **Balanced [[Forces]]**: Opposing [[forces]] with equal magnitude cancel each other; no resultant force.
	- **Unbalanced [[Forces]]**: [[Forces]] do not cancel out, resulting in a **net force** in one or more directions.
- Gravity itself is an [[acceleration]]; gravitational force acts as a force.
- **Newton’s Laws of [[Motion]]**
	- First Law: An object **remains at rest or in constant [[motion]]** unless acted upon by a force.
	- Second Law: **force equals [[mass]] times [[acceleration]]** $F = ma$; rate of [[momentum]] change.
	- Third Law: Every action has an **equal and opposite reaction**, acting on different objects.
- **Elasticity and Hooke’s Law**
	- [[Elastic]] materials return to **original shape after force removal; $F = kΔx$,** where $k$ is the spring constant.
	- **Limit of Proportionality**: Force-extension proportionality limit.
	- [[Elastic]] Limit: Beyond which material does not return to its original shape.
- **[[Circular Motion]]**
	- **Constant change in direction**, hence changing [[velocity]] even at constant [[speed]].
	- **Centripetal force** directed toward the circle’s center; **depends on [[mass]], [[speed]], and radius.**
- **[[Friction]] and Opposing [[Motion]]**
	- [[Friction]] **opposes [[motion]]**, causing [[temperature]] increase due to [[energy]] transfer by heating.
		- Drag: Type of [[friction]] acting on objects moving through fluids.
		- Terminal [[Velocity]]: Achieved when air resistance equals the object’s [[weight]], resulting in constant [[speed]].

#### 1.6 [[Momentum]]
![[00_MOC-20241102183703145.png]]
- **[[Momentum]]**: Defined as the product of [[mass]] and [[velocity]] $p = mv$. An object at rest has no [[momentum]].
- **[[Impulse]]**: Change in [[motion]] due to an external force over a short time $I = FΔt$. It equals the change in [[momentum]] $Δp$.
- **[[Conservation of Momentum]]**: In a closed system, total [[momentum]] before an event equals total [[momentum]] after.
- **Force and [[Momentum]]**: Newton's second law $F = ma$ relates force to the rate of change of [[momentum]] $F = Δp/Δt$.

#### 1.7 [[Energy, Work, & Power]]

> [!def] [[Energy]]
> The ability to do [[work]] (J, Joules).
> [[Work]] is a transfer in [[energy]]:
> $$\Delta E = W = F \cdot d$$
> Where displacement occurs in same direction as force.

  
Methods of storing [[energy]]:
- **Kinetic**: Stored due to movement
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- **Chemical**: Stored in chemical compounds
- **Gravitational Potential**:
$$E_p = mg\Delta h$$
(Potential for conversion to other forms)
- **Nuclear**: In atomic nuclei (fission/fusion)
- **Static Electricity**: Stored in stationary charges
- **Thermal**: Internal molecular [[motion]]
- **[[Elastic]] Potential**:
$$E_e = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
Stored in strained materials

**[[Energy]] Transfers**
Conversion mechanisms:
- Mechanical [[work]] (force application)
- Waves:
	- Sound
	- Light
	- Water waves
- Electric current
- Heat
$$\Delta E_{\text{system}} + \Delta E_{\text{surroundings}} = 0$$
- [[Energy]] cannot be created/destroyed
- Only transforms between forms


$$\Delta E_k = W_{\text{net}}$$

  
Efficiency calculation:

$$\eta = \frac{E_{\text{useful}}}{E_{\text{input}}} \times 100\%$$

#### 1.8 [[Pressure]]
![[00_MOC-20250305173426443.png]]
#### $$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
**Force exerted over an area**
Pa (pascals): $1\ \text{Pa} = 1\ \text{N/m}^2$
$P_{\text{atm}} = 101,\!000\ \text{Pa}$ (1010 hPa)
	**Equivalent to**:
	- $760\ \text{mmHg}$ (mercury column)
	- $10.3\ \text{m}$ water column


**[[Pressure]] due to a [[Liquid]]**
- Acts equally in all directions
- Increases with depth: $P \propto h$
- Depends on [[liquid]] [[density]]: $P \propto \rho$
- Independent of container shape##### $$ P = \rho g h $$
![[Pressure-20250305212921218.png|341]]

  
**[[Pressure]] due to a [[Gas]]**
- Acts equally in all directions
- Decreases with altitude
- Compressible
- Exerts equal [[pressure]] on container walls

| Instrument | Function | Key Formula/Value |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Barometer | Measures atmospheric [[pressure]] | $1\ \text{atm} = 760\ \text{mmHg}$ |
| Manometer | Measures [[pressure]] differences | $\Delta P = \rho g \Delta h$ |
| Altimeter | Measures altitude | Uses [[pressure]]-altitude relationship |

$1\ \text{bar} = 100,\!000\ \text{Pa}$
$1\ \text{millibar} = 100\ \text{Pa}$



**Boyle's Law**
For fixed [[mass]] of [[gas]] at constant [[temperature]]:

$$ p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2 $$
- **Inverse relationship**: $P \propto \frac{1}{V}$
- Applies to ideal gases
- [[Temperature]] must remain constant

The ideal [[gas]] law:

$$ PV = nRT $$

Relates the macroscopic properties of ideal gases. An ideal [[gas]] is one where particles:
(a) Do not attract/repel each other
(b) Have no volume
