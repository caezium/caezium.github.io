> Friction is a force that works in **opposition** to the [[Motion]] of an object
- When friction occurs, energy is transferred by **heating**
    - Friction causes an increase in **temperature** of the object and its surroundings
    - The work done against the frictional [[Forces]] causes this rise in the temperature

- **Gases** and **liquids** are known as **fluids**
    - Fluids are different to solids because the **particles** in fluids are **free to move** around
- Friction acts on objects moving through gases and liquids as the particles collide with the object 
    - This type of friction is called **drag**
- Air resistance is a **type of friction** that slows the [[Motion]] of an object moving through **air**
- When the force of **air resistance** becomes **equal** to the force of [[Weight]], then the object **stops accelerating** and falls at a **constant [[Speed]]**
    - This is called *terminal [[Velocity]]*
