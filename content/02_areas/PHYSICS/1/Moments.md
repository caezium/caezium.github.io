> [!def] **Moment**
> *The turning effect of a force about a pivot*

 The **moment** of a force is the **turning effect** produced when a force is exerted on an object
- Forces can cause the **rotation** of an object about a fixed **pivot**
- This rotation can be **clockwise** or **anticlockwise**

_**The force applied will cause the object to rotate clockwise about the pivot**_

> [!def] size of a moment
> $$\text{moment} = \text{force} \cdot \text{ perpendicular distance from pivot}$$

- **Increasing** the **distance** at which a force is applied from a pivot **decreases** the **force** required  
    - If you try to push open a door right next to the hinge, it is very difficult, as it requires a lot of force
    - If you push the door open at the side furthest from the hinge, then it is much easier, as less force is required

## Principle of moments
- The **principle of moments** states that:
**If an object is balanced, the total clockwise moment about a pivot equals the total anticlockwise moment about that pivot**


- The principle of moments means that for a balanced object, the moments on both sides of the pivot are **equal** 
**clockwise moment = anticlockwise moment**

# **Equilibrium**
> [!def]
> **A state of balance or stability**

- For objects in equilibrium:
    - The **forces** on the object must be **balanced**
        - There must be no **resultant force**
    - The **sum of clockwise moments** on the object must **equal** the **sum of anticlockwise moments**
        - There must be no **resultant moment**

## [[Center of Gravity]]
> [!def]
> **The point through which the weight of an object acts**

_**The object will topple, when its center of gravity is no longer over its base**_
- If the center of gravity does not lie above its base, then an object will **topple** over
- The most stable objects have a **low** center of gravity and a **wide** base
_**Cars are stable because they have a low center of gravity and a wide base**_
- Taller objects with a narrow base have a higher center of gravity and are less stable
- This is why lorries and buses are advised not to use motorways and bridges on very windy days
