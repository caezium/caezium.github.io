> [!def]
> 1. A body remains at rest, or in [[motion]] at a constant [[speed]] in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
> 2. At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's [[acceleration]] multiplied by its [[mass]] or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [[momentum]] is changing with time.
>  $$F = ma = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
> 3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

#### _For Newton's third law_
_force must be_:
- same type
- act in the same plane but opposite directions
- act on different objects
