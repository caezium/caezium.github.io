**work => is a transfer in [[energy]]**

J (Joules) -> $\frac{kg/m^2}{s^2}$

work = $\Delta$E = Force x Distance or displacement (in the same direction as the force)
#### $W = F \cdot d$
#### $W = F \cdot s$

- Measured in **joules** (J).
- **Scalar** quantity.

$W = Fs\cos\theta$  

Special cases:
- Parallel: $W = Fs$
- Perpendicular: $W = 0$

### Work-[[Energy]] Theorem
$\Delta E_k = W_{net}$

**Work done** is equal to **[[energy]] transformed**.
