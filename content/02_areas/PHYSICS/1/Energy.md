> [!def] Energy
> the ability to do [[work]]

J, Joules 


[[work]] => is a transfer in energy


[[work]] = $\Delta$E = Force x Distance or displacement (in the same direction as the force)
$W = F \cdot d$


#### Energy Store
=> a way to store energy

ex.
- **Kinetic energy**: stored due to movement
- **Chemical energy**: stored in chemical compounds
- **Gravitational potential energy**: stored due to height
	- potential => the potential to be converted into another type of energy
- **[[Nuclear energy]]**: in the nucleus
	- protons and neutrons, if broken, protons explode out, fission.
- **Static electricity**: stored in charge that is not moving
- **Thermal energy**: internal
- **[[Elastic]] potential energy**: stored in stretching/straining


#### Energy Transfer
=> ways to transfer energy to different forms

- **mechanical [[work]] due to force**
- **waves** - electromagnetic waves
	- *sound*
	- *light*
	- *water waves*
- **electric current**
- **heat**


##### Conservation of Energy
total energy in a closed system remains unchanged, you cannot make or destroy energy
- Energy can’t be created or destroyed.
- Can change from one form to another.

# Energy Forms
1. **Kinetic**:  
   $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
2. **Gravitational PE**:  
   $E_p = mg\Delta h$
3. **[[Elastic]] PE**:  
   $E_e = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
	1. [[Work]] done is the **area under the graph** of force (F) against extension of the spring (x).


4. Kinetic.
	- Due to [[motion]].
	- 1/2 × [[Mass]] × [[Velocity]]²
	- ¹/₂ 𝑚𝑣²
5. Potential.
	- Due to changed position, shape, or state.
6. Gravitational potential.
	- Due to gravity.
	- [[Mass]] × 𝑔 × height
	- 𝑚𝑔ℎ
7. [[Elastic]] potential.
	- Strain.
	- Due to stretching/compressing.
8. Chemical potential.
	- Due to chemical bonds.
9. Electric potential.
	- Due to electricity.
10. Nuclear potential.
	- Due to rearrangement/splitting of [[atoms]].
11. Internal.
	- Due to [[motion]] of molecules.
12. Light.
	- Due to light waves.
13. Sound.
	- Due to sound waves.

### [[Work]]-Energy Theorem
$\Delta E_k = W_{net}$
**[[Work]] done** is equal to **energy transformed**.

##### Sankey diagrams
block with total energy, then arrows of the respective percentages of energy going out.
Useful energy will go straight to the right, while wasted energy will bend down
This can show how much energy is wasted and useful in a diagrammatical way.

$$efficiency$$
$$e = \frac{E_{useful}}{E_{input}} \cdot 100\% $$

#### Energy Resources
The ultimate energy source is our sun -> solar, tides, currents, photosynthesis (fossils, bio)
Nuclear fission in the sun -> energy -> radiation to Earth

##### Renewable
- can be produced at similar rate of consumption
	- (or within human lifetime? )

**Fuel**: something that can be burned to release heat and light energy


##### Non-renewable
- gone forever
- ex. coal, fossil fuels
