The ideal gas law (**PV = nRT**) relates the macroscopic properties of ideal gases. An ideal gas is a gas in which the particles (a) do not attract or repel one another and (b) take up no space (have no volume).


- No gas is completely ideal, but air at normal room temperature and pressure, based on experiments, behaves very similar to an ideal gas
