> [!def] Mass
> mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object at rest relative to the observer

**Mass and weight are not the same**
*Mass* is the **amount of matter** in an object and is measured in **kilograms**


- Weight is a **gravitational force on an object with mass**
- Since weight is a force, it is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**
- Weight is measured in **newtons** (N)
## $$W = m\cdot g$$
acceleration of free fall = $g = \frac{W}{m}$
