###### the pencil in the fig above is 5.4cm long

time - clock, stopwatch, ticker timer

###### the time took to run one lap is 50 seconds.

2 or 3 [[02_areas/PHYSICS/00_General/Significant Figures]]
#### to avoid parallax error
- reading need to be done at *eye level*
- eye must be *perpendicular* to the scale
- the *bottom meniscus*

#### measuring cylinders
**find volume of liquids or irregular solids by displacement**
measure at bottom meniscus, eyes perpendicular to scale

## measuring small values
measure **multiple times so it's more accurate** because repeating helps **reduce errors when measuring small intervals.**

# scalars and [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/vectors]]
**scalars - magnitude only**
- ex. [[mass]], energy, volume
**[[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/vectors]] - both magnitude and direction**
- ex. [[velocity]], force, [[momentum]], [[acceleration]], [[weight]]


| **Scalar**  | **Vector**              |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| distance    | displacement            |
| [[speed]]       | [[velocity]]                |
| [[mass]]        | [[weight]]                  |
|             | force                   |
|             | [[acceleration]]            |
|             | [[momentum]]                |
|             | electric field strength |
| energy      |                         |
| volume      |                         |
| [[density]]     |                         |
| temperature |                         |
| power       |                         |
|             |                         |

#### **distance vs displacement**
![[Physical properties quantities and measurement-20241102165708222.png|492]]


#### **[[speed]] vs [[velocity]]**
*[[Speed]]* is a measure of the **distance** travelled by an object per unit time, **regardless of the direction**

*[[Velocity]]* is a measure of the **displacement** of an object per unit time, **including the direction**
