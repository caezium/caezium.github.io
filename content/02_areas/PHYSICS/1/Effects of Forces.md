> [!def] Force
> A push or a pull that acts on an object due to the interaction with another object

[[Forces]] can have a variety of effects on an object
[[Forces]] can change an object's
    - **[[Speed]]**
    - **direction**
    - **shape**
    - **size**

### Balanced and Unbalanced [[forces]]
- The [[forces]] acting on an object can be described as **balanced** or **unbalanced**
- [[Forces]] are **balanced** if multiple [[forces]] act in **opposing directions** with an **equal magnitude** in each direction
    - The effects of the [[forces]] then **cancel out**
    - There is **no resultant force** in that plane of direction
- [[Forces]] are **unbalanced** if the effects of the [[forces]] acting in each plane do **not** cancel out
    - There is a **resultant force** in one or more planes of direction

No resultant force is *incorrect* -> instead, **say the resultant force is 0**

## Gravity $g$
Gravity is not a *force*, but a type of *[[Acceleration]]*
Gravitational Force is a *force*. 

> [!def]
> *[[Acceleration]]* - $m\cdot s^{-2}$
> *gravitational field strength* - $N\cdot m^{-1}$

# *Change in [[Motion]]*
## **[[Newton's Three Laws of Motion]]**
> [!def]
> 1. A body remains at rest, or in [[motion]] at a constant [[speed]] in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
> 2. At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's [[acceleration]] multiplied by its [[mass]] or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [[momentum]] is changing with time.
>  $$F = ma = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
> 3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

#### _For Newton's third law_
_force must be_:
- same type
- act in the same plane but opposite directions
- act on different objects

# *Change in Shape*
### [[Elastic]]
> [!def] 
> you put a force on an object, making the object change shape, and it returns to its *original shape* after you remove the force
### **[[Hooke's Law]]**
> [!def]
> A material resists with a *force* proportional to it *extension* before limit of proportionality
> $$F=k\Delta x$$
> where k is *stiffness* and also the *spring constant*

> Limit of proportionality -> not proportional but still [[Elastic]]
> [[Elastic]] Limit -> not [[Elastic]]

# *Change in Direction*
## **[[Circular Motion]]**
- [[Velocity]] is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**
- Therefore, the [[Velocity]] of an object is its **[[Speed]]** in a given **direction**
- When an object travels in **[[Circular Motion]]**, its **direction** is always **changing**
    - Therefore, the **[[Velocity]]** of an object in [[Circular Motion]] is always **changing,** even if its **[[Speed]]** is constant

- **[[Circular Motion]]** is a type of **[[Acceleration]]** since [[Acceleration]] is a **change in [[Velocity]]**
![[Forces-20241102174355475.png]]


- When a force acts **perpendicularly** to an object’s direction of travel, the force will cause that object to change direction

- Therefore, for an object in [[Circular Motion]], the **force** is always directed **toward** the **center** of the circle  
- The **force** needed to make something follow a circular path depends on a number of factors:
    - **The [[Mass]] of the object**  
        - A greater [[Mass]] requires a greater force when the [[Speed]] and radius are constant
    - **The [[Speed]] of the object**  
        - A faster-moving object requires a greater force when the [[Mass]] and radius are constant
    - **The radius of the circle**  
        - A smaller radius requires a greater force to keep the [[Speed]] and radius constant

### The resultant force is towards the center of the circle
## **Centripetal Force**
$$ F=m \frac{v^2}{R} = m \omega^2R$$

# *Opposing [[Motion]]*
## **[[Friction]]**
> [!def]
> [[Friction]] is a force that works in **opposition** to the [[Motion]] of an object
- When [[Friction]] occurs, energy is transferred by **heating**
    - [[Friction]] causes an increase in **temperature** of the object and its surroundings
    - The work done against the frictional [[forces]] causes this rise in the temperature


![[Forces-20241102174619876.png]]

- **Gases** and **liquids** are known as **fluids**
    - Fluids are different to solids because the **particles** in fluids are **free to move** around
- [[Friction]] acts on objects moving through gases and liquids as the particles collide with the object 
    - This type of [[Friction]] is called **drag**
- Air resistance is a **type of [[Friction]]** that slows the [[Motion]] of an object moving through **air**
- When the force of **air resistance** becomes **equal** to the force of [[Weight]], then the object **stops accelerating** and falls at a **constant [[Speed]]**
    - This is called *terminal [[Velocity]]*
