> **The point through which the [[weight]] of an object acts**

- For a symmetrical object of uniform [[density]], the **center of gravity is located at the point of symmetry**
    - For example, the center of gravity of a sphere is at the center

#### Center of gravity of an object in different positions

_**The object will topple, when its center of gravity is no longer over its base**_
- If the center of gravity does not lie above its base, then an object will **topple** over
- The most stable objects have a **low** center of gravity and a **wide** base
_**Cars are stable because they have a low center of gravity and a wide base**_
- Taller objects with a narrow base have a higher center of gravity and are less stable
- This is why lorries and buses are advised not to use motorways and bridges on very windy days

###  [[Moments]] and stability
- If the line of action of the **[[weight]]** force lies outside the base of the object, there will be a **resultant moment,** and the body will topple

![A car on various inclined planes up to 60 degrees without toppling because the line of action of its weight still lies within its base. A bus is tilted to 45 degrees before the line of action of its weight lies outside its base.](media/A_car_on_various_inclined_planes_up_to_60_degrees_without_toppling_because_the_line_of_action_of_its.png)
_**The car can be titled to 60° without toppling, but the bus will topple at 45°**_




#### Determining the center of gravity of an irregularly shaped plane lamina

_**For irregularly shaped objects, the centre of gravity can be found using the suspension method**_
1. Punch 3 holes near the outer edges of the plane lamina in different locations
2. Create a loop of thread and hang the plane lamina from the clamp
3. Use a plumb line (a weighted thread) aligned with the hanging thread to show the line of action of the [[weight]] force
4. Use a ruler and pencil to mark the line of action of the [[weight]] force onto the plane lamina
5. Repeat the process until 3 lines have been drawn
6. The point at which the lines cross is the position of the centre of gravity
