>[!def] Electric Charge
>A fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force in an [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. Charge comes in two types: positive and negative. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C).

## Fundamental Properties

### Basic Characteristics
1. **Charge Types**
   - Positive charge (protons)
   - Negative charge (electrons)
   - Neutral (equal positive and negative)

2. **Conservation of Charge**
   - Cannot be created or destroyed
   - Only transferred between objects
   - Total charge remains constant

3. **Quantization**
   - Comes in discrete units
   - Elementary charge: e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
   - All charges are multiples of e

### Force Interactions
1. **Like Charges**
   - Repel each other
   - Force increases with charge magnitude
   - Force decreases with distance

2. **Unlike Charges**
   - Attract each other
   - Force follows same magnitude rules
   - Essential for atomic structure

## Charge Transfer

### Methods
1. **[[Charging by Friction]]**
   - Rubbing materials together
   - Electron transfer
   - Creates static charge

2. **Conduction**
   - Direct contact
   - Charge flows through [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|conductors]]
   - Requires conducting path

3. **Induction**
   - No direct contact
   - Charge separation
   - Temporary or permanent

## Charge in Matter
### Material Behavior
1. **In Conductors**
   - Free electrons
   - Easy charge movement
   - Quick charge redistribution

2. **In Insulators**
   - Bound electrons
   - Limited charge movement
   - Can hold static charge

## Measurement and Detection

### Instruments
1. **Electroscope**
   - Detects presence of charge
   - Shows charge type
   - Simple demonstration tool

2. **Coulomb Meter**
   - Measures charge quantity
   - Digital readout
   - High precision

### Calculations
1. **Charge Quantity**
   - Q = It (for steady current)
   - Q = CV (for capacitors)
   - Q = ne (for discrete charges)

## Applications

### Practical Uses
1. **[[Static Electricity & Electric Fields|Static Electricity]]**
   - Photocopiers
   - Paint spraying
   - Air filters

2. **[[Current|Electric Current]]**
   - Power distribution
   - Electronics
   - Communications

3. **Technology**
   - Capacitors
   - Semiconductors
   - Sensors

## Charge and Fields

### Field Creation
1. **Point Charges**
   - Radial field pattern
   - Field strength ∝ 1/r²
   - Direction based on charge sign

2. **Charge Distributions**
   - Complex field patterns
   - Superposition principle
   - Field mapping possible

### [[Potential Difference|Electric Potential]]
1. **Relationship**
   - Potential energy per charge
   - Drives current flow
   - Creates voltage

2. **Field Effects**
   - Work done against field
   - Energy storage
   - Charge movement


>[!note] Historical Context
>The concept of electric charge was first systematically studied by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the 18th century, leading to Coulomb's Law which describes the force between charges.

## Common Misconceptions

>[!important] Key Clarifications
>1. Charge is not "used up" in circuits
>2. Neutral objects contain charges (equal amounts)
>3. Charge flow doesn't require complete circuits for static effects
>4. The proton/electron charge ratio is exactly 1:-1

## Safety Considerations

### Handling Charged Objects
1. **Static Discharge**
   - Controlled release
   - Grounding methods
   - Protection of sensitive equipment

2. **Personal Safety**
   - Avoid charge buildup
   - Use appropriate equipment
   - Follow safety procedures
