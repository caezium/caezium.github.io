>[!def] Ohm's Law
>The current flowing through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the [[Potential Difference]] across it, provided the temperature and other physical conditions remain constant.

## Mathematical Expression

### Basic Formula
- V = IR
- I = V/R
- R = V/I
- Units: V (volts), I (amperes), R (ohms)

### Conditions
1. **Temperature**
   - Must remain constant
   - Affects resistance
   - Influences conductivity

2. **Physical Conditions**
   - No mechanical strain
   - No magnetic effects
   - Constant cross-section

## Consequences of Ohm's Law

### Circuit Analysis
1. **Series Circuits**
   - Same current throughout
   - Voltage divided
   - R(total) = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

2. **Parallel Circuits**
   - Same voltage across branches
   - Current divided
   - 1/R(total) = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

### Power Relationships
- P = VI
- P = I²R
- P = V²/R
- All derived from Ohm's Law

## I-V Graph for Ohmic Conductors

### Linear Relationship
1. **Characteristics**
   - Straight line through origin
   - Constant gradient = 1/R
   - No threshold voltage

2. **Interpretation**
   - Slope indicates resistance
   - Steeper = lower resistance
   - Shallower = higher resistance

>[!note] Key Understanding
>Ohm's Law is fundamental to electrical circuit analysis but only applies under specific conditions. Many modern electronic components are intentionally non-ohmic for specific applications.

>[!example] Calculation Example
>In a 12V circuit with a 6Ω resistor:
>- Current = 12V ÷ 6Ω = 2A
>- Power = 12V × 2A = 24W
>- This assumes constant temperature and ideal conditions
