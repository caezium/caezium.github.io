>[!def] Conductors and Insulators
>Materials are classified based on their ability to allow electric [[Charges|charge]] to flow through them:
>- **Conductors**: Materials that easily allow charge to flow
>- **Insulators**: Materials that strongly resist charge flow

## Conductors

### Properties
1. **Electronic Structure**
   - Have free electrons in outer shell
   - Electrons can move easily through material
   - Low resistance to charge flow

2. **Charge Distribution**
   - Charges spread evenly across surface
   - Quick charge redistribution
   - Create uniform [[Electric Fields|electric fields]]
