>[!def] Static Electricity
>The accumulation of electric [[Charges|charge]] on the surface of objects. Unlike current electricity, these charges remain stationary ("static") until they can be transferred through conduction or discharged rapidly.

**Methods of Charging**
1. **[[Charging by Friction]]** - Most common method
   - Electrons transfer between materials when rubbed together
   - Materials become oppositely charged
   - Conservation of charge applies

2. **Charging by Contact** - Direct touching transfers charge
3. **Charging by Induction** - No direct contact needed

**On [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|Conductors]]**
- Charges spread evenly across surface
- Quick redistribution of charge
- Can be easily discharged
- Metal objects conduct static away

**On [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|Insulators]]**
- Charges remain localized
- Slow or no charge movement
- Can maintain charge for longer periods
- Plastic and rubber hold static well

**Standard Notation**
- **I**: [[Current]] (amperes, A)
- **V**: [[Potential Difference]] (volts, V)  
- **R**: [[Resistance]] (ohms, Ω)
- **P**: Power (watts, W)
- **E**: Energy (joules, J)

**[[Current]] in Metals**
![[02_areas/PHYSICS/4/attachments/590f5a934c04bec2a8dbc819f3f7977a_MD5.jpg]]

>[!def] Electric Current
>The flow of electric [[Charges|charge]] (typically electrons) through a conductor. Measured in amperes (A), where 1 ampere = 1 coulomb of charge per second.
>$$I = \frac{Q}{t}$$

**Electron Flow**
- Free electrons move through metal lattice
- Direction: negative to positive (actual)
- Conventional current: positive to negative
- Speed: typically few millimeters per second

**Factors Affecting Current**
1. **[[Potential Difference]]** - Higher voltage = more current
2. **[[Resistance]]** - Opposes current flow
3. **Temperature** - Affects material properties

**Direct Current (DC)**
- Constant direction
- May vary in magnitude
- Examples: batteries, solar cells

**Alternating Current (AC)**  
- Periodically reverses direction
- Sinusoidal waveform
- Frequency: 50/60 Hz typical
- Used for power distribution

**Voltage & [[Potential Difference]]**

>[!def] Potential Difference (Voltage)
>The work done per unit charge to move a positive charge between two points in an [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. Measured in volts (V).
>$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

![[02_areas/PHYSICS/4/attachments/2f9689c3571c90d25f0be026de4f0fff_MD5.jpeg]]

**Measurement**
- Connected in parallel across components
- Always relative between two points
- Voltmeter has high resistance

**Types**
1. **Source Voltage** - [[Electromotive Force EMF|EMF]] of batteries/generators
2. **Voltage Drop** - Across circuit components

**[[Resistance]]**

>[!def] Resistance
>The opposition that a material offers to the flow of electric current. Measured in ohms (Ω).
>$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

**Formula**: R = ρl/A
- ρ = resistivity (material property)
- l = length of conductor
- A = cross-sectional area

**Resistance of a Wire**
![[02_areas/PHYSICS/4/attachments/c3782cc05b65414a5052f96293011a44_MD5.jpeg]]
- Electrons collide with metal ions
- Collisions transfer energy → heating
- Increased temperature → increased resistance
- Resistance ∝ length, Resistance ∝ 1/area

**Non-Ohmic Components**
- Don't follow Ohm's Law
- Non-linear I-V relationship
- Examples: diodes, thermistors, filament lamps

**Heating Effect of Current**
- Power dissipated = I²R
- Energy conversion to heat
- Temperature rise in conductors

**[[Ohm's Law]]**

>[!def] Ohm's Law
>The current flowing through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the [[Potential Difference]] across it, provided temperature and other physical conditions remain constant.
>$$V = IR$$

**Power in Circuits**

**Power Equations**
- P = VI (voltage × current)
- P = I²R (current squared × resistance)  
- P = V²/R (voltage squared ÷ resistance)

**Energy Transfer**
- E = Pt (power × time)
- Units: joules (J)
- 1 kWh = 3,600,000 J
