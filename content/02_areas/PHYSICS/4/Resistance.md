>[!def] Resistance
>The opposition that a material offers to the flow of electric current. Measured in ohms (Ω), it determines how much current flows for a given [[Potential Difference]].

## [[Ohm's Law]] and Resistance

### Basic Relationship
- R = V/I
- Resistance in ohms (Ω)
- Voltage in volts (V)
- Current in amperes (A)

### Effect of Resistance on Current
1. **Direct Relationship**
   - Higher resistance → Lower current
   - Lower resistance → Higher current
   - For constant voltage

2. **Circuit Impact**
   - Current limitation
   - Voltage division
   - Power dissipation

## Current-Voltage Graphs

### I-V Graph for Ohmic Conductors
1. **Characteristics**
   - Linear relationship
   - Passes through origin
   - Constant gradient (1/R)

2. **Interpretation**
   - Slope = conductance
   - Steeper = lower resistance
   - Constant resistance value

### I-V Graph for Non-Ohmic Devices

#### 1. Filament Lamp
- Non-linear curve
- Resistance increases with temperature
- Higher voltage → Higher resistance

#### 2. Diode
1. **Forward Bias**
   - Low resistance above threshold
   - Exponential current increase
   - Typical threshold ~0.6V

2. **Reverse Bias**
   - Very high resistance
   - Minimal current flow
   - Breakdown voltage limit

## Resistance of a Wire
- As electrons pass through a wire, they **collide** with the metal ions in the wire
    
- These collisions transfer energy away from the kinetic store of the electrons, which causes them to **slow down**
    
- The energy from the electrons is transferred to the kinetic store of the vibrating metal ions
    
    - This causes the vibration of the ions to increase (increased temperature)
        
    - As the vibration of the ions increases, the more the electrons collide with them (increased resistance)

### Factors Affecting Resistance

#### 1. Length (l)
- Directly proportional
- R ∝ l
- Longer wire = Higher resistance

#### 2. Cross-sectional Area (A)
- Inversely proportional
- R ∝ 1/A
- Thicker wire = Lower resistance

#### 3. Material (ρ)
- Resistivity
- Material-specific constant
- Temperature dependent

### Mathematical Relationship
- R = ρl/A
- ρ = resistivity
- l = length
- A = cross-sectional area

## Temperature Effects

   - Component selection
   - Safety margins

2. **Applications**
   - Temperature sensing
   - Circuit protection
   - Power management
