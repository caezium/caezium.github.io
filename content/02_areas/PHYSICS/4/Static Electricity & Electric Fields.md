>[!def] Static Electricity
>The accumulation of electric [[Charges|charge]] on the surface of objects. Unlike current electricity, these charges remain stationary ("static") until they can be transferred through conduction or discharged rapidly.

## Formation of Static Electricity

### Methods of Charging
1. **[[Charging by Friction]]**
   - Most common method
   - Electrons transfer between materials
   - Materials become oppositely charged

2. **Charging by Contact**
   - Direct touching of charged and neutral objects
   - Charge spreads between objects
   - Both objects end up with same charge type

3. **Charging by Induction**
   - No direct contact needed
   - Temporary charge separation
   - Can create permanent charging if grounding is used

## Behavior of Static Charges

### On [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|Conductors]]
- Charges spread evenly across surface
- Quick redistribution of charge
- Can be easily discharged
- Metal objects conduct static away

### On [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|Insulators]]
- Charges remain localized
- Slow or no charge movement
- Can maintain charge for longer
- Plastic and rubber hold static well

## Electric Fields and Static

### Field Characteristics
- [[Electric Fields|Electric field]] surrounds charged objects
- Field strength depends on:
    - Amount of charge
    - Distance from charge
    - Material properties
- Fields can be visualized using field lines

### Field Interactions
- Like charges create repulsive fields
- Unlike charges create attractive fields
- Fields can be distorted by nearby objects
- Conductors can shield fields

## Practical Applications

### Everyday Examples
1. **Photocopiers**
   - Use static charge to attract toner
   - Transfer toner to paper using fields

2. **Paint Spraying**
   - Charged paint particles
   - Attracted to grounded surfaces
   - Even coating achieved

3. **Air Purifiers**
   - Electrostatic precipitation
   - Remove dust and particles
   - Clean air output

### Industrial Uses
1. **Electrostatic Precipitators**
   - Industrial emission control
   - Remove particulate pollution
   - High voltage fields used

2. **Crop Spraying**
   - Charged pesticide droplets
   - Better plant coverage
   - Reduced waste

## Safety and Prevention

### Static Hazards
- Spark discharge risks
- Electronic component damage
- Fuel handling dangers
- Explosive atmosphere risks

### Prevention Methods
1. **Grounding**
   - Regular discharge of static
   - Earth connections
   - Conducting paths

2. **Humidity Control**
   - Moisture reduces static
   - Controlled environments
   - Air conditioning

3. **Anti-static Measures**
   - Special materials
   - Conducting floors
   - Protective clothing
