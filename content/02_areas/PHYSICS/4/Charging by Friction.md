>[!def] Charging by Friction
>A process where materials become electrically charged when rubbed together, causing electrons to transfer from one material to another through physical contact and friction.

## The Process

### How It Works
1. Two neutral materials are rubbed together
2. [[Charges|Electrons]] transfer from one material to another
3. One material becomes positively charged (loses electrons)
4. Other material becomes negatively charged (gains electrons)

>[!important] Conservation of Charge
>The total charge remains constant during the process - electrons are neither created nor destroyed, only transferred between materials.

## Triboelectric Series

### Understanding Material Tendencies
- Materials are ranked by their tendency to:
    - Gain electrons (become negative)
    - Lose electrons (become positive)
- The further apart materials are in the series, the stronger the charging effect

>[!example] Common Materials (Top to Bottom)
>- Human Hair (+ve)
>- Glass
>- Silk
>- Paper
>- Cotton
>- Wood
>- Hard Rubber
>- Plastic
>- Polyester
>- Teflon (-ve)

## Common Examples

### Everyday Occurrences
1. **Balloon on Hair**
   - Balloon becomes negative
   - Hair becomes positive
   - Attraction observed

2. **Walking on Carpet**
   - Shoes gain/lose electrons
   - Body builds up charge
   - Can lead to static shock

3. **Clothes in Dryer**
   - Fabrics rub together
   - Static cling develops
   - Clothes stick together

## Factors Affecting Charging

### Environmental Conditions
1. **Humidity**
   - High humidity reduces charging
   - Water molecules conduct charge away
   - Harder to build up static charge

2. **Temperature**
   - Affects material properties
   - Can change electron transfer rates
   - Influences charge retention

3. **Surface Conditions**
   - Clean surfaces charge better
   - Rough surfaces increase contact
   - Material purity matters

## Applications
