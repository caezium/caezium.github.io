>[!def] Electric Current
>The flow of electric [[Charges|charge]] (typically electrons) through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A), where 1 ampere represents a flow of 1 coulomb of charge per second.

## Basic Concepts

### Definition in Terms of Charge
- Current (I) = Charge (Q) ÷ Time (t)
- I = Q/t
- Units: Amperes (A) = Coulombs (C) per second (s)

>[!example] Example Calculation
>If 12 coulombs of charge flow through a wire in 4 seconds:
>Current = 12C ÷ 4s = 3A

### Direction of Current
1. **Conventional Current**
   - Flows from positive to negative
   - Historical convention
   - Used in circuit diagrams

2. **Electron Flow**
   - Actual movement of electrons
   - Flows from negative to positive
   - Opposite to conventional current

## Types of Current

### Direct Current (DC)
- Flows in one direction only
- Constant magnitude
- Examples:
    - Batteries
    - Solar cells
    - USB ports

### Alternating Current (AC)
- Changes direction periodically
- Varying magnitude
- Examples:
    - Mains electricity
    - Power stations
    - Most household appliances

## Current in Conductors

### Conduction Mechanism
1. **Free Electrons**
   - Present in [[Electrical Conductors and Insulators|conductors]]
   - Can move through material
   - Carry the electric charge

2. **Drift Velocity**
   - Slow net movement of electrons
   - Typically few millimeters per second
   - Despite slow electron movement, electrical effects travel near light speed
   - (?)

### Factors Affecting Current
1. **Voltage**
   - Higher voltage = larger current
   - Provides "pushing force"
   - [[Potential Difference]] drives current

2. **Resistance**
   - Opposes current flow
   - Converts electrical energy to heat
   - Depends on material properties

### Ammeter Use
- Connected in series
- Has very low resistance
- Measures current passing through

### Safety Considerations
1. **Maximum Ratings**
   - Don't exceed ammeter range
   - Use appropriate fuse protection
   - Start with highest range first

2. **Circuit Connection**
   - Always in series
   - Never in parallel
   - Break circuit to insert

## Applications

### Practical Uses
1. **Household**
   - Lighting
   - Heating
   - Power delivery

2. **Industrial**
   - Motors
   - Electroplating
   - Process control

3. **Electronics**
   - Integrated circuits
   - Signal processing
   - Digital devices

## Circuit Relationships

### Ohm's Law
- V = IR
- Current proportional to voltage
- Inverse to resistance

### Power Relationships
- P = VI
- P = I²R
- Energy transfer rate

>[!note] Safety Warning
>Electric current can be dangerous. Even small currents can be lethal if they pass through the heart. Always follow proper safety procedures when working with electricity.

## Common Misconceptions

>[!important] Key Points
>1. Current is not "used up" in a circuit
>2. Current is the same at all points in a series circuit
>3. Higher voltage doesn't always mean higher current (depends on resistance)
>4. AC current can transfer power over longer distances more efficiently than DC
