>[!def] Electrical Energy
>The energy transferred when electric charges move through a [[Potential Difference|potential difference]]. Measured in joules (J) or kilowatt-hours (kWh).

## Basic Principles

### Energy Transfer
1. **Forms of Transfer**
   - Electrical → Thermal (heating)
   - Electrical → Mechanical (motors)
   - Electrical → Light (lamps)
   - Electrical → Chemical (charging batteries)

2. **Conservation of Energy**
   - Energy cannot be created/destroyed
   - Only converted between forms
   - Some energy always lost as heat

## Energy Calculations

### Basic Equations
1. **Energy from Power**
   - E = P × t
   - E (joules) = P (watts) × t (seconds)
   - Common units: kWh = kW × hours

2. **Energy from Current**
   - E = V × I × t
   - E = I²Rt
   - E = V²t/R

### Practical Units
1. **Kilowatt-hour (kWh)**
   - 1 kWh = 3,600,000 joules
   - Standard billing unit
   - Domestic electricity metering

2. **Energy Cost**
   - Cost = Energy (kWh) × Price per kWh
   - Standing charges
   - Peak/off-peak rates

## Power in Circuits

### Power Equations
1. **Basic Formula**
   - P = V × I
   - Power in watts (W)
   - Voltage in volts (V)
   - Current in amperes (A)

2. **Alternative Forms**
   - P = I²R
   - P = V²/R
   - Choose based on known values

### Power Ratings
1. **Devices**
   - Maximum safe power
   - Operating efficiency
   - Energy consumption

2. **Components**
   - Resistor power ratings
   - Safety margins
   - Heat dissipation

## Energy Efficiency

### Efficiency Calculation
- Efficiency = (Useful output energy ÷ Total input energy) × 100%
- Always less than 100%
- Ways to improve efficiency

### Energy Losses
1. **Heat Loss**
   - I²R heating
   - Component heating
   - Transmission losses

2. **Other Losses**
   - Magnetic fields
   - Sound
   - Mechanical friction

### Industrial Applications
1. **Motors**
   - Power output
   - Efficiency
   - Starting current
   - Operating costs

2. **Heating Systems**
   - Resistance heating
   - Induction heating
   - Temperature control
   - Energy management

## Safety Considerations

### Electrical Safety
1. **Overload Protection**
   - Circuit breakers
   - Fuses
   - Power limits

2. **Insulation**
   - Prevention of energy leakage
   - Safety standards
   - Regular testing

>[!example] Practical Example
>A 2000W kettle used for 5 minutes:
>- Energy = 2000W × 300s = 600,000J
>- In kWh = 600,000J ÷ 3,600,000 = 0.167 kWh
>- At £0.15/kWh = £0.025 cost
