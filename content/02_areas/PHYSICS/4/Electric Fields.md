>[!def] Electric Field
>A region in space where an electric force acts on any charged particle placed within it. The electric field strength at any point is defined as the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a positive test charge placed at that point.

## Basic Concepts

### Definition
- Electric Field (E) = Force (F) ÷ Charge (q)
- E = F/q
- Units: Newtons per Coulomb (N/C)

>[!example] Example Calculation
>If a 2C charge experiences a 10N force:
>E = 10N ÷ 2C = 5 N/C

### Field Properties
1. **Direction**
   - Points away from positive charges
   - Points toward negative charges
   - Shows direction of force on positive test charge

2. **Magnitude**
   - Decreases with distance
   - Proportional to source charge
   - Follows inverse square law
