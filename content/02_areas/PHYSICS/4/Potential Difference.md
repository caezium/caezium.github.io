>[!def] Potential Difference (Voltage)
>The work done per unit charge to move a positive charge between two points in an [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. Measured in volts (V), where 1 volt represents 1 joule of work per coulomb of charge.

## Basic Concepts

### Definition
- Voltage (V) = Work Done (W) ÷ Charge (Q)
- V = W/Q
- Units: Volts (V) = Joules (J) per Coulomb (C)

>[!example] Example Calculation
>If 10 joules of work moves 2 coulombs of charge:
>Voltage = 10J ÷ 2C = 5V

### Physical Meaning
1. **Energy Perspective**
   - Represents electrical potential energy
   - Drives [[Current|electric current]]
   - Indicates energy available per charge

2. **Field Perspective**
   - Measure of electric field strength
   - Related to charge separation
   - Determines force on charges

   - Parallel connections
   - Charging systems

## Safety Considerations

### Hazard Levels
1. **Low Voltage** (<50V)
   - Generally safe
   - Still requires care
   - Used in electronics

2. **Mains Voltage** (100-240V)
   - Potentially lethal
   - Requires proper insulation
   - Common in households

3. **High Voltage** (>1000V)
   - Extremely dangerous
   - Specialist equipment needed
   - Industrial applications

### Safety Measures
1. **Personal Protection**
   - Insulated tools
   - Safety equipment
   - Proper training

2. **Circuit Protection**
   - Fuses
   - Circuit breakers
   - Isolation transformers

## Common Configurations

### Series Circuits
- Voltages add up
- Same current throughout
- Voltage divider effect

### Parallel Circuits
- Same voltage across branches
- Currents add up
- Independent paths

>[!important] Key Points
>1. Voltage is always measured between two points
>2. It represents potential energy per unit charge
>3. It's the driving force for electric current
>4. Different voltage levels serve different purposes

## Common Misconceptions

>[!note] Important Clarifications
>1. Voltage doesn't "flow" - it's a potential difference
>2. Zero volts doesn't mean no electricity
>3. Higher voltage doesn't always mean more dangerous
>4. Voltage can exist without current flow
