### Standard Notation
- I: Current (amperes, A)
- V: [[Potential Difference]] (volts, V)
- R: [[Resistance]] (ohms, Ω)
- P: Power (watts, W)
- E: Energy (joules, J)

## Current in Metals

### Electron Flow
- Free electrons move through metal lattice
- Direction: negative to positive
- Conventional current: positive to negative
- Speed: typically few millimeters per second

### Factors Affecting Current
1. **[[Potential Difference]]**
   - Higher voltage = more current
   - Follows [[Ohm's Law]]
   - Drives electron movement

2. **[[Resistance]]**
   - Opposes current flow
   - Depends on material properties
   - Temperature dependent

## AC vs DC

### Direct Current (DC)
1. **Characteristics**
   - Constant direction
   - May vary in magnitude
   - Example: batteries

2. **Applications**
   - Electronics
   - Battery-powered devices
   - Solar systems

### Alternating Current (AC)
1. **Characteristics**
   - Periodically reverses direction
   - Sinusoidal waveform
   - Frequency (50/60 Hz typical)

2. **Applications**
   - Power distribution
   - Household electricity
   - Industrial equipment

## Voltage & [[Potential Difference]]

### Measurement
- Parallel connection
- Measured across components
- Always relative between two points

### Types
1. **Source Voltage**
   - [[Electromotive Force EMF|EMF]] of batteries
   - Power supply output
   - Generator output

2. **Voltage Drop**
   - Across components
   - Sum in series circuits
   - Equal in parallel branches

## [[Resistance]]

### Formula
- R = V/I ([[Ohm's Law]])
- Units: ohms (Ω)
- Temperature dependent

### Non-Ohmic Components
- Don't follow Ohm's Law
- Non-linear I-V relationship
- Examples: diodes, thermistors

### Variable Resistors
1. **Types**
   - Potentiometers
   - Rheostats
   - Thermistors
   - Light-dependent resistors (LDRs)

2. **Applications**
   - Volume control
   - Brightness control
   - Temperature sensing
   - Light sensing

### Heating Effect of Current
- Power dissipated = I²R
- Temperature rise
- Energy conversion to heat
- Practical applications (heaters)

## Power in Circuits

### Equations
1. **Power Calculations**
   - P = VI
   - P = I²R
   - P = V²/R

2. **Energy Transfer**
   - E = Pt
   - Units: joules (J)
   - Power × time

### Energy in kWh
1. **Definition**
   - 1 kWh = 3,600,000 J
   - Standard billing unit
   - Power × time (hours)

2. **Practical Usage**
   - Household billing
   - Energy consumption
   - Cost calculations


>[!example] Calculation Example
>For a 12V circuit with 2A current:
>- Resistance (R) = V/I = 12V/2A = 6Ω
>- Power (P) = VI = 12V × 2A = 24W
>- Energy (1 hour) = 24W × 3600s = 86,400J
