#### thoughts

overall car structure and material
- even weight distribution
- as light as possible (maybe just wooden frames?)
- (length of the car?)
- avoid unnecessary parts/attachments or sharp edges (because aerodynamics)
- make sure the axles are parallel

Wheels
- largest wheels (more perimeter so for each rotation it drives longer)
- 4 wheels so it goes in a straight line better
- CD
- all 4 wheels has to be the same size or else a longer lever arm might not work

Back Wheel drive
- mousetrap engine on the front
- back wheel drive is better than front wheel drive
wrap back wheels with rubber balloons
- more traction (maybe? this also makes the car slower in some cases but this allows the mousetrap engine to be placed further to the front)


*I do not really know how to do this but it would be good if we could do this (if not, we need balloons on the front wheels too*
Front wheels with a negative chamber (slanted inwards)
- this gives extra stability and helps the car maintain a straight path
- lighter contact with the surface too
- does not need rubber balloons because it would cause unnecessary friction and contact

Ball bearings or straw tubes
- these will be attached the the axils to they turn smoother
- both can work but ball bearings will be best
- (do we need grease/oil? the car will probably not move that fast because we are going for distance)

String and mousetrap lever arm
- the string should have a mechanism that allows it to be pulled off so that once the entire string length is gone through, it will detach automatically and smoothly to preserve most of the coasting energy
- the lever arm should be as long as possible, this requires testing and optimizing. a longer arm means more torque but decreases the pulling force (if the pulling force is too low, the car will not start moving)

*I also do not really know how to specifically achieve this but its has been done before with great results, this is what really gives the most distance*
Gear ratios
- a larger disc (we'll call it the driving disc) attached to the lever arm of the mousetrap, the disc will receive the motion of the mousetrap's release mechanism
- then, a smaller disc (maybe 3:1 ratio) (call it the driven disc) to the rear axle (the back wheel drive axle)
- this allows the driver disc to make one full rotation and move the driven disc multiple times (3 times). the driven disc turns faster and more so we get more distance drove. however we need to keep in mind of torque, if the torque is too low, then this won't work, adjusting torque means figuring out a gear ratio that works.



testing stuff
I think we have to test stuff often and analyze the results of different changes.
I think the lever arm length and gear ratio can be calculated/simulated if we did lots of tests and math. But I don't know if we will have enough time.
