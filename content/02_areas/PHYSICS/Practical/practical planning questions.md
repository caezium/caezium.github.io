1 materials prepare - 1 mark
2 setup the stuff as shown in the picture.diagram

ex.

choose a metal wire
change weights until the wire breaks
repeat the experiment at least 3 times to find an average load
repeat the above for different metlas

4 marks, total 5 marks now

-draw table for the results
1 mark, 6 marks now


explain how you would use the results to reach a conclusion
-plot a graph and compare the loads required to break the wire
1 mark


control variable
independent and dependent variable in graphs and tables

total 7 marks

Apparatus: ice cubes, refrigerator, water, water heater, timer, beaker, thermometer
1. Prepare the apparatus, make sure the temperature and size of the ice cubes are the same.
2. Take one beaker and pour in some hot water. choose a temperature from $25\degree C$ $30\degree C$ $90\degree C$ 
3. measure the temperature of that hot water using a thermometer.
4. record the temperature down and add in an ice cube
5. start the timer and stop the timer when the ice cube is completely melted
6. record the data and clean the beaker of its contents, wait till beaker cools down to room temperature
7. repeat steps 2-6 for the same temperature 3 times to find an average.
8. repeat steps 2-7 for the 3 other temperatures
9. plot a graph with the temperature and time taken and find the trend/relationship of temperature and average time for ice to melt. compare the temperature and the time for the ice to melt

| temperature ($\degree C$) | time 1 (m) | time 2 (m) | time 3 (m) | average time for ice to melt (m) |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| 25                        |            |            |            |                                  |
| 30                        |            |            |            |                                  |
| 90                        |            |            |            |                                  |
|                           |            |            |            |                                  |
|                           |            |            |            |                                  |
|                           |            |            |            |                                  |

Apparatus: track with stand, boss, and clamp. selection of metal balls. bench. protractor. ruler. sand tray
1. prepare the apparatus, make sure the metal balls are the same mass and size
2. set up the experiment as shown in the diagram
3. choose an angle for the right side of the track, measure it with a protractor and then record it
4. roll a ball down from the left top
5. wait until the ball lands still
6. measure the distance travelled from the table leg to the first impact (use sand tray)
7. record results
8. repeat steps 3-7 for the same angle two more times to find an average distance
9. repeat steps 3-8 for three different chosen angles
10. draw a line graph of the relationship between angle (x axis) and how far the ball travels. compare the angle with distance travelled.

table
degree( $\degree$) | distance 1 (cm) | distance 2 (cm) | distance 3 (cm) | average (cm)
