- During a **phase change** (i.e. a change of state) thermal [[energy]] is transferred to a substance or removed from it
    - During a phase change, the **[[temperature]]** of the substance **does not change**

- In this case, the thermal [[energy]] is calculated as follows:



- [[Energy]] transferred = [[Mass]] × Specific latent heat
- 𝑄 = 𝑚𝐿
	- Where:
	    - _Q_ = heat [[energy]] transferred (J)
	    - _m_ = [[mass]] of the substance in kilograms (kg)
	    - _L_ = specific latent heat of the substance (J kg–1)

- Types.
    1. Fusion.
        - Amount of [[energy]] required to melt 1 𝑘𝑔 of a substance.
    2. Vaporisation.
        - Amount of [[energy]] required to boil 1 𝑘𝑔 of a substance.
