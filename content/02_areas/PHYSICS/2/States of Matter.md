sidenotes on the top of this note
special ones
Bose-Einstein Condensate => very cold, moves very little
cooled to near absolute zero (0 K, − 273.15 °C, or − 459.67 °F; K = kelvin), coalesce into a single quantum mechanical entity—that is, one that can be described by a wave function—on a near-macroscopic scale.

Plasma => electrically charged [[gas]], very hot [[gas]]
When a neutral [[gas]] is heated such that some of the electrons are freed from the [[atoms]] or molecules, it changes state and becomes a plasma. It consists of a partially-ionized [[gas]], containing ions, electrons, and neutral [[atoms]].

more sidenotes
distance between particles can be seen as potential [[energy]], the closer they are the more potential they will collide.

## Solids, Liquids & Gases
- The three [[02_areas/CHEM/1/States of Matter|states of matter]] are **[[solid]]**, **[[liquid]]** and **[[gas]]**
- The **kinetic theory of [[matter]]** is a model that attempts to explain the properties of the three [[02_areas/CHEM/1/States of Matter|states of matter]]
    - In this model, particles are assumed to be small spheres

#### Water as a [[solid]], [[liquid]], and a [[gas]]

![Water as a Solid, Liquid, and Gas, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Water_as_a_Solid,_Liquid,_and_Gas,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**Water has three states of [[matter]]; [[solid]] ice, [[liquid]] water and gaseous steam. The difference between each state is the arrangement of the particles**_

### Solids
- Particles in a [[solid]]...
    - Are **closely packed**
    - Are arranged in a fixed pattern (**lattice structure**)
    - Can only **vibrate** about their fixed positions
    - Have **low energies** compared to particles in liquids and gases
    - Therefore, do **not** have enough [[energy]] to **overcome** the **intermolecular [[forces]]** of attraction holding them together
        

#### Molecular arrangement in a [[solid]]

![Molecular Arrangement in a Solid, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Molecular_Arrangement_in_a_Solid,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**In a [[solid]], particles are arranged in a fixed pattern, with no spaces between them, and are only able to vibrate about their fixed positions**_

- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, solids...
    - Have a fixed shape (although some solids can be deformed when [[forces]] are applied)
    - Have a fixed volume
    - Are very difficult to compress
    - Have higher **densities** than liquids and gases

### Liquids
- Particles in a [[liquid]]...  
    - Are **closely packed**
    - Are **randomly** arranged (i.e. there is no fixed pattern)
    - Can **flow** past each other
    - Have **higher energies** than particles in solids, but lower energies than [[gas]] particles
    - Therefore, have enough [[energy]] to **partially overcome** the **intermolecular [[forces]]** of attraction holding them together

#### Molecular arrangement in a liquid

![Molecular Arrangement in a Liquid, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Molecular_Arrangement_in_a_Liquid,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**In a [[liquid]], particles are arranged randomly and are able to flow past one another**_
- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, liquids...
    - Do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are held in
    - Have a fixed volume
    - Are difficult to compress
    - Have lower densities than solids, but higher densities than gases
    
### Gases
- Particles in a [[gas]]...  
    - Are **far apart** (the average distance between the particles is ∼10 times greater than the distance between the particles in solids and liquids)
    - Are **randomly** arranged
    - Move around in **all directions** at a variety of speeds, occasionally **colliding** with each other and with the walls of the container they are in
    - Are negligible in size compared to the volume occupied by the [[gas]]
    - Have **higher energies** than particles in solids and liquids
    - Therefore, have enough [[energy]] to overcome the **intermolecular [[forces]]** of attraction holding them together
    
#### Molecular arrangement in a [[gas]]

![Molecular Arrangement in a Gas, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Molecular_Arrangement_in_a_Gas,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**In a [[gas]], particles can move around freely in all directions (shown by the arrows)**_

- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, gases...    
    - Do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are held in
    - Do not have a fixed volume and expand to completely fill the available volume
    - Can be compressed
    - Have the lowest densities (∼1000 times smaller than the densities of solids and liquids)
        

## kinetic theory of gases
> Molecules of a gas behave as identical (or all have the same mass)
> Molecules of gas are hard, perfectly elastic spheres
> The molecules are in continuous random motion
> There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between the molecules
> External forces (e.g. gravity) are ignored
> Newton's laws apply
> The volume of the molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container
> The molecules collide perfectly elastically with the walls of the container exerting a pressure upon them
> The time of a collision is negligible compared to the time between collisions
> There are a very large number of molecules

## Changes of State

#### [[Heating Curve]]
![[States of Matter-20250305213536580.png|434]]

---

- A **change of state,** or **phase** change, happens whenever [[matter]] changes from one phase ([[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]]) into another
    - During a phase change, thermal [[energy]] is transferred to or from a substance

- This [[energy]] transfer does **not change the [[temperature]]** of the substance undergoing the phase change, meaning
    - The thermal [[energy]] provided (or removed) does not affect the **kinetic [[energy]]** of the molecules within the substance
    - Only the **potential [[energy]]** (i.e. the spacing between the [[atoms]] or molecules) is affected
        

- The four main phase changes are:
    - **Melting** - i.e. when a substance changes from [[solid]] to [[liquid]] as it absorbs thermal [[energy]]
    - **Freezing** - i.e. when a substance changes from [[liquid]] to [[solid]] as it releases thermal [[energy]]
    - **Vaporisation** (or **boiling**) - i.e. when a substance changes from [[liquid]] to [[gas]] as it absorbs thermal [[energy]]
    - **Condensation** - i.e. when a substance changes from [[gas]] to [[liquid]] as it releases thermal [[energy]]
        

### Phase changes of water

![changes-of-state-of-water-ib-physics-revision-notes](media/changes-of-state-of-water-ib-physics-revision-notes.png)

- Each substance has its own melting (or freezing) and boiling points
    - For example, the freezing point of water is 0 °C and its boiling point is 100 °C
    
- Possible phase changes of water include
    - [[Solid]] ice **melting** into [[liquid]] water at 0 °C
    - [[Liquid]] water **boiling** and changing into gaseous water vapour at 100 °C

- Both these changes happen when **thermal [[energy]]** is absorbed
    - If thermal [[energy]] is released from water vapour at 100 °C, it condenses back into water
    - If water continues to release thermal [[energy]], it cools down until it reaches 0 °C and **freezes** into ice
        
- Melting and freezing happen at the **melting** / **freezing** **point** of a substance

- Vaporization and condensation happen at the **boiling point** of a substance
