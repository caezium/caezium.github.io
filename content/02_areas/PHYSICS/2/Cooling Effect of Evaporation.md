Evaporation is the escape of more energetic particles from the surface of a liquid.

At surface => less particles around, easier to escape
more energetic => more energy, easier to escape

only occurs at the surface

so higher kinetic energy particles escape, leaving the lower kinetic energy particles, so the average kinetic energy of that liquid decreases, therefore
evaporation has a cooling effect, decreases the temperature of the liquid left


think
wet clothes => the water in your clothe evaporates, cooling the cloth, if you are wearing the clothe => your body is lending heat energy to it, and your body will also be cooled => you get sick, a cold
cooling of an object in contact with an evaporating liquid


after drying of clothes => feels cold too
