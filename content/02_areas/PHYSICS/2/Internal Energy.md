>[!def] Internal [[Energy]]
>**The sum of the total kinetic [[energy]] and the total intermolecular potential [[energy]] of the particles within the substance**
    

- When a substance gains or loses thermal [[energy]], its **internal [[energy]]** increases or decreases 

- As thermal [[energy]] is transferred to a substance, two things can happen:
    - An increase in the average **kinetic [[energy]]** of the molecules within the substance - i.e. the molecules vibrate and move at higher speeds
    - An increase in the **potential [[energy]]** of the molecules within the substance - i.e. the particles get further away from each other or move closer to each other
        

#### What is internal [[energy]]?

![Internal Energy of Particles, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Internal_Energy_of_Particles,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**Kinetic [[energy]] and potential [[energy]] are the two [[energy]] stores that make up internal [[energy]]**_

- [[Temperature]] is a measure of the average kinetic [[energy]] of the molecules
    - Therefore, only an **increase** in the average kinetic [[energy]] of the molecules will result in an **increase in [[temperature]]** of the substance
    - Due to [[thermal expansion]], when the [[temperature]] of a substance increases, the **potential [[energy]]** of the molecules also increases

- When **only** the **potential [[energy]]** of the molecules changes, the **[[temperature]]** of the substance **does not change**
    - This is the case for all **state changes** (e.g. melting, boiling)
