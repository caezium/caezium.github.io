special ones
Bose-Einstein Condensate => very cold, moves very little
cooled to near absolute zero (0 K, − 273.15 °C, or − 459.67 °F; K = kelvin), coalesce into a single quantum mechanical entity—that is, one that can be described by a wave function—on a near-macroscopic scale.

Plasma => electrically charged [[gas]], very hot [[gas]]
When a neutral [[gas]] is heated such that some of the electrons are freed from the [[atoms]] or molecules, it changes state and becomes a plasma. It consists of a partially-ionized [[gas]], containing ions, electrons, and neutral [[atoms]].

more sidenotes
distance between particles can be seen as potential [[energy]], the closer they are the more potential they will collide.

## Solids, Liquids & Gases
- The three [[02_areas/PHYSICS/2/States of Matter|states of matter]] are **[[solid]]**, **[[liquid]]** and **[[gas]]**
- The **kinetic theory of [[matter]]** is a model that attempts to explain the properties of the three [[02_areas/PHYSICS/2/States of Matter|states of matter]]
    - In this model, particles are assumed to be small spheres

## Changes of State

#### [[Heating Curve]]
![[States of Matter-20250305213536580.png|434]]

---

- A **change of state,** or **phase** change, happens whenever [[matter]] changes from one phase ([[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]]) into another
    - During a phase change, thermal [[energy]] is transferred to or from a substance

- This [[energy]] transfer does **not change the temperature** of the substance undergoing the phase change, meaning
    - The thermal [[energy]] provided (or removed) does not affect the **kinetic [[energy]]** of the molecules within the substance
    - Only the **potential [[energy]]** (i.e. the spacing between the [[atoms]] or molecules) is affected

- Melting and freezing happen at the **melting** / **freezing** **point** of a substance

- Vaporization and condensation happen at the **boiling point** of a substance

# [[Brownian Motion]]

>[!def] [[Brownian Motion]]
>The random movement of larger particles due to collisions from smaller, faster moving particles
>

some Brownian guy observed pollen and saw it move by itself, so he thought the pollen was alive.
Einstein later came to say that there were smaller, faster moving particles hitting the pollen.
