## Heating Curve
![[Heating Curve-20250226104643694.png]]

At the beginning of the heating curve, the object is a **[[solid]]**, where its particles are very close together, they are held with *strong intermolecular [[forces]]*, *vibrate about fixed positions* and have a definite shape and volume due to being in a *rigid lattice structure.*
As we begin to add [[energy]], the [[energy]] added to the [[solid]] is used to **increase the average kinetic [[energy]] of the particles**, therefore increasing the [[temperature]]. 
We see that the curve **plateaus** for a while, this point is the **melting point**, here we see that the [[energy]] is not used for increasing the average kinetic [[energy]]. Instead, the [[energy]] is used to *overcome the intermolecular bonds*, allowing particles to break free from their fixed positions, the intermolecular [[forces]] are overcome. This is a phase transition, where [[solid]] and [[liquid]] both exist and it is trying to turn into a [[liquid]] with more freedom of movement. At this point is the [[temperature]] where the [[energy]] is used to break the intermolecular [[forces]] instead of raising the [[speed]] of the particles.

When all the intermolecular [[forces]] are weakened, the particles are *still close together but with no regular pattern of arrangement, they can now slide with each other* and they are now a **[[liquid]]**. In a [[liquid]], they can flow around with each other with no definite shape but still a definite volume, they take the shape of their container. 
The [[energy]] added can now continue to increase the average kinetic [[energy]] of the particles, raising the [[temperature]], making the particles moving faster. 
Then it plateaus again, this time it is trying to break the remaining intermolecular [[forces]], this is the boiling point, where it tries to **turn from a [[liquid]] into a [[gas]]**. The particles are escaping the [[liquid]] as a randomly moving, high [[speed]] particle, [[gas]] particles. 

When they have broken free from the [[forces]] holding them together, the **[[gas]]** molecules are now *far apart from each other, with negligible intermolecular [[forces]].* A [[gas]] does not have a *definite volume nor shape and will expand to fill its container.*
Continuing to add [[energy]] to the [[gas]] will make the particles average kinetic [[energy]] higher, making them move faster. Usually the [[specific heat capacity]] for gases are lower, so that part's gradient is steeper.

**Scientific Accuracy/Clarity:**
*"the energy is weakening the intermolecular bonds to break free from their fixed positions"*    
→ **Change to**: "the energy is **used to overcome** the intermolecular bonds, allowing particles to break free from fixed positions"    
*Reason*: "Weakening" is vague; energy directly breaks bonds during phase changes (latent heat).

*"the intermolecular forces are partially overcome"*   
→ **Change to**: "the intermolecular forces are **fully overcome** to transition from solid to liquid"  
*Reason*: At the melting point, bonds must be fully broken for particles to transition to liquid. Partial overcoming occurs during pre-melting.

*"gas does not have a definite volume nor shape"*   
→ **Add**: "and will expand to fill its container"  
*Reason*: Gases not only lack definite shape/volume but actively expand.

---
**Terminology Precision:**- *"definite shape and volume"* (solid)    
→ **Add**: "due to particles being held in a rigid lattice"  
*Reason*: Emphasize why solids have fixed shape/volume (structure matters).
*"no definition shape"* (liquid)   
→ **Correct to**: "no **definite** shape"    
*Reason*: Typo and phrasing consistency with "definite volume."

*"gas molecules are now far apart from each other"*    
→ **Add**: "with negligible intermolecular forces"    
*Reason*: Gases are defined by minimal particle interactions, not just spacing.

---
**Context for IGCSE Level:**
*"this is a phase transition, where solid and liquid both exist"*    
→ **Add**: "This is called **melting** (fusion), and temperature remains constant until all the solid melts."   
*Reason*: Explicitly name the process and reinforce constant temperature during phase changes.

*"this is the boiling point, where it tries to turn from a liquid into a gas"*    
→ **Add**: "Boiling occurs when vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, allowing bubbles of gas to form **throughout** the liquid."   
*Reason*: IGCSE exams often test understanding of boiling vs. evaporation.

---
**Flow/Structure Improvements:**
*"When all the intermolecular forces are weakened, the particles are still close together..."*    
→ **Reorganize**: "Once **all** intermolecular forces are overcome, the particles can slide past one another, forming a liquid. They remain close but lack a fixed arrangement..."  
*Reason*: Avoid passive voice and clarify causation.

*"Continuing to add energy to the gas will make the particles average kinetic energy higher"*    
→ **Add**: "This corresponds to the **steepest gradient** on the heating curve, as gases have the lowest specific heat capacity."   
*Reason*: Link back to the graph’s features (key for exam answers).

---
**Minor Tweaks for Consistency:**
*"they can flow around with each other"* (liquid)    
→ **Change to**: "they can **slide past** each other"    
*Reason*: "Flow" is correct but "slide past" aligns with IGCSE mark schemes.

*"temperature where the energy is used to break the intermolecular forces"*    
→ **Add**: "This is called **latent heat of fusion**."  
*Reason*: Use formal term to match syllabus vocabulary.
