specific heat capacity
Objects store [[energy]], called internal [[energy]]. It is a measure of the total [[energy]] of all particles in the object, which includes kinetic [[energy]] and chemical potential [[energy]] of all the bonds between them.
Total [[energy]] of all particles. 
a glass of water may have a higher [[temperature]], but a swimming pool stores a lot mor [[energy]] because there are a lot more particles.

> [!def] Specific Heat Capacity
> The amount of [[energy]] required to raise the [[temperature]] of 1kg of the substance by 1$\degree C$.

it is a property of the material

$$E = mc\Delta T$$
E = [[Energy]]
m = [[mass]]
**c = specific heat capacity**
$\Delta$T=change in [[temperature]]

When heated, a substance's [[temperature]] can increase, but that depends on the [[mass]], type of material, and amount of thermal [[energy]] transferred.
The specific heat capacity, is the [[energy]] required per unit [[mass]] per unit [[temperature]] increased

in other words
the amount of [[energy]] required to raise [[[[Temperature]]|the [[tempe]]rature]] of 1kg of a substance by 1$^\circ C$)


- Amount of [[energy]] required to raise 1 𝑘𝑔 of a substance by 1°C.
- [[Energy]] transferred = [[Mass]] × Specific heat capacity × [[Temperature]] change
- 𝑄 = 𝑚𝑐𝛥𝑇
- 𝐽/𝑘𝑔°C

_**The high specific heat capacity of water means it heats up and cools down much slower than metals, such as copper**_
