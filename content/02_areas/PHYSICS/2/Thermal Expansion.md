- [[Atoms]] vibrate more with increase in [[temperature]].
- Cause an increase in volume.
- Reverse also occurs with decrease in [[temperature]].
	- Thermal contraction.
- Greatest in gases. [[Heating Curve]]
- Smallest in solids.
- Consequences.
	1. Overhead cables have to be slack.
		- Allowing for contraction on cold days.
		- ![[Thermal Properties and Temperature-20250305224640282.png]]
	2. Gaps have to be left in bridges.
		- Allowing for expansion on hot days.

- Applications.
	- Bimetals.
		- Thin strip of 2 different metals.
		- Strip bends when heated.
			- Once strip bends more than the other.
		- Usage.
			1. Bimetallic thermostat.
				- Used to regulate [[temperature]].
				- Operation.
					1. [[Temperature]] rises.
						- Strip bends.
						- Contacts separate.
						- Current to heater cut off.
					2. [[Temperature]] falls.
						- Strip straightens.
						- Contacts join.
						- Current to heater switched on.
			2. Bimetallic toaster.
				- [[Temperature]] rises.
				- Strip bends.
				- Allows toasted bread to pop up.
