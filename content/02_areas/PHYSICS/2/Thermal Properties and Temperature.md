# [[Temperature]]
**the average kinetic [[energy]] of particles in a substance**

- On the thermodynamic (Kelvin) [[temperature]] scale,¬†**absolute zero**¬†refers to the lowest possible [[temperature]]¬†
    - This is equal to 0 K or ‚àí273 ¬∞C
    
- It is not possible to have a [[temperature]] lower than 0 K
    - This means a [[temperature]] in Kelvin will¬†**never**¬†be a negative value
- Absolute zero is defined as:
>[!def] Absolute Zero
>**The [[temperature]] at which the molecules in a substance have zero kinetic [[energy]]**¬†
    
- This means for a system at 0 K, it is not possible to remove any more [[energy]] from it
- Even in space, the [[temperature]] is roughly 2.7 K, just above absolute zero
    

### How to use the Kelvin Scale

- To convert between temperatures¬†_Œ∏_¬†in the Celsius scale, and¬†_T_¬†in the Kelvin scale, use the following conversion:
    
_**Œ∏**_¬†**/ ¬∞C = T / K ‚àí 273**
**T / K =**¬†_**Œ∏**_¬†**/ ¬∞C + 273**

# [[Thermal Expansion]]
- [[Atoms]] vibrate more with increase in [[temperature]].
- Cause an increase in volume.
- Reverse also occurs with decrease in [[temperature]].
	- Thermal contraction.
- Greatest in gases. [[Heating Curve]]
- Smallest in solids.
- Consequences.
	1. Overhead cables have to be slack.
		- Allowing for contraction on cold days.
		- ![[Thermal Properties and Temperature-20250305224640282.png]]
	2. Gaps have to be left in bridges.
		- Allowing for expansion on hot days.

# [[Specific Heat Capacity]]

> [!def] [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
> The amount of [[energy]] required to raise the [[temperature]] of 1kg of the substance by 1$\degree C$.

it is a property of the material

$$E = mc\Delta T$$
E = [[Energy]]
m = [[mass]]
**c = [[specific heat capacity]]**
$\Delta$T=change in [[temperature]]

in other words
the amount of [[energy]] required to raise the [[temperature]] of 1kg of a substance by 1$^\circ C$)

| **Substance** | **[[Specific Heat Capacity]] (J/kgK)** |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Water         | 4200                               |
| Ice           | 2200                               |
| Aluminium     | 900                                |
| Copper        | 390                                |
| Gold          | 130                                |

_**The high [[specific heat capacity]] of water means it heats up and cools down much slower than metals, such as copper**_

# [[Internal Energy]]
>[!def] [[Internal Energy]]
>**The sum of the total kinetic [[energy]] and the total intermolecular potential [[energy]] of the particles within the substance**
    

- When a substance gains or loses thermal [[energy]], its¬†**[[internal energy]]**¬†increases or decreases 

- As thermal [[energy]] is transferred to a substance, two things can happen:
    - An increase in the average¬†**kinetic [[energy]]**¬†of the molecules within the substance - i.e. the molecules vibrate and move at higher speeds
    - An increase in the¬†**potential [[energy]]**¬†of the molecules within the substance - i.e. the particles get further away from each other or move closer to each other
        

#### What is internal [[energy]]?

![Internal Energy of Particles, for IB Physics Revision Notes](media/Internal_Energy_of_Particles,_for_IB_Physics_Revision_Notes.png)

_**Kinetic [[energy]] and potential [[energy]] are the two [[energy]] stores that make up [[internal energy]]**_

- [[Temperature]] is a measure of the average kinetic [[energy]] of the molecules
    - Therefore, only an¬†**increase**¬†in the average kinetic [[energy]] of the molecules¬†will result in an¬†**increase in [[temperature]]**¬†of the substance
    - Due to [[thermal expansion]], when the [[temperature]] of a substance increases, the¬†**potential [[energy]]**¬†of the molecules also increases

- When¬†**only**¬†the¬†**potential [[energy]]**¬†of the molecules changes, the¬†**[[temperature]]**¬†of the substance¬†**does not change**
    - This is the case for all¬†**state changes**¬†(e.g. melting, boiling)
