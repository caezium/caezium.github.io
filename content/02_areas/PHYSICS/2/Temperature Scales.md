#### [[Temperature]]
the average kinetic [[energy]] of particles in a substance


- On the thermodynamic (Kelvin) [[temperature]] scale, **absolute zero** refers to the lowest possible [[temperature]] 
    - This is equal to 0 K or −273 °C
    
- It is not possible to have a [[temperature]] lower than 0 K
    - This means a [[temperature]] in Kelvin will **never** be a negative value
- Absolute zero is defined as:
>[!def] Absolute Zero
>**The [[temperature]] at which the molecules in a substance have zero kinetic [[energy]]** 
    
- This means for a system at 0 K, it is not possible to remove any more [[energy]] from it
- Even in space, the [[temperature]] is roughly 2.7 K, just above absolute zero
    

### How to use the Kelvin Scale

- To convert between temperatures _θ_ in the Celsius scale, and _T_ in the Kelvin scale, use the following conversion:
    
_**θ**_ **/ °C = T / K − 273**
**T / K =** _**θ**_ **/ °C + 273**

- The divisions on both scales are equal, which means
    **A change in a [[temperature]] of 1 K is equal to a change in [[temperature]] of 1 °C**

#### [[Temperature]] & Kinetic [[Energy]]

- Particles in gases usually have a range of speeds
- The **average kinetic [[energy]]** of the particles _E__k_ can be calculated using the equation

$$E_{k} = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$$
- Where:
    - $E_k$ = average kinetic [[energy]] of the particles in joules (J)
    - $k_{b}$ = 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1 (**Boltzmann's constant**)
    - $T$ = absolute [[temperature]] in kelvin (K)
        
- This tells us that the absolute [[temperature]] of a body is **directly proportional** to the average kinetic [[energy]] of the molecules within the body

#### Thermal [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]

- Thermal [[energy]] is **always** transferred from a hotter region to a lower region
    - Eventually, once the regions reach the same [[temperature]], no more thermal [[energy]] is transferred

- Thermal [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Equilibrium|equilibrium]] is defined as:
    **When two substances in contact with each other no longer exchange any heat [[energy]] and both reach an equal [[temperature]]**
    
- There is no longer thermal [[energy]] transfer between the regions

##### Thermal [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Equilibrium|equilibrium]] and the direction of [[energy]] flow

_**Two regions of different temperatures will eventually reach thermal [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Equilibrium|equilibrium]]**_
- The two regions need to be in **thermal contact** for this to occur
    - The **hotter** region will cool down and the **cooler** region will heat up until they reach the **same** [[temperature]]

_**The final [[temperature]] of the water depends on the initial [[temperature]] difference between the water and ice**_
- An example of this is ice in room [[temperature]] water
    - The ice cubes heat up as thermal [[energy]] is transferred **from** the water
    - Therefore, the water cools down as thermal [[energy]] is transferred away from the water **to** the ice
