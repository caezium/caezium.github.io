A motion sensor detects movement in the office and sends the analogue data as an input signal to the microprocessor where an ADC coverts it so that the microprocessor is able to read it. 
The microprocessor compares the data to the preset value of being on or not.
If movement is detected, the microprocessor sends a signal to switch the lights on. 
If no movement is detected, the microprocessor starts a timer. 
If the timer reaches 2 minutes without detecting movement, the microprocessor sends a signal to switch the lights off. 
This process repeats continuously in a loop to control the lights automatically.
