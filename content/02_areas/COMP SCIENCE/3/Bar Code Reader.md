A shop worker would use a barcode reader to read the barcode to find out the price of the product. The barcode reader uses infrared light to detect the black bars on the barcode. It converts the analog signals into digital signals with an ADC and using the different widths of the bars, it is able to differentiate what number each bar is supposed to represent. The final number is read and sent to the system, which uses the number to return the price of the product

At the supermarket, barcodes are read using a barcode reader. The barcode reader shines infrared light onto the barcode. The white bars in the barcode reflects the light, and the black bars absorb it. The reflected light is picked up by the barcode reader and converted to an electric signal using an ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter). The different widths of the black bars are used to differentiate between which number it represents. The number is sent to the supermarket's database, which uses the number as identification and returns the price of the product.

mark scheme


- shines red light
- sensors/photoelectric cells detect the light
- different reflections/bars give different binary/digital values // (pattern) converted to binary/digital values
- uses check digit error checking

- database stores data/barcodes/products/prices
- barcode data is transmitted
