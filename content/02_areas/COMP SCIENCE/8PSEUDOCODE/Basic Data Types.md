## Red task

Sleep calculator

Create a pseudocode algorithm for a program to calculate how many hours per week you sleep.

Add code to your program to find the total number of hours spent sleeping in a month. Assume and average of 4.35 weeks per month.

Now find the number of days per month you sleep for!

```pseudocode

DECLARE hourspernight : INTEGER

OUTPUT “how man hours per night do you sleep?”

Hourspernight <- INPUT

DECLARE hoursperweek : INTEGER

Hoursperweek <- hourspernight * 7

OUTPUT  “You sleep ”,hoursperweek,” hours per week”

DECLARE hourspermonth : REAL

Hourspermonth = hoursperweek * 4.35

OUTPUT “you sleep “, hourspermonth, “ hours per month”

DECLARE dayspermonth : REAL

Dayspermonth <- hourspermonth / 24

OUTPUT “this equates to “, dayspermonth,” days per month”

```
