### What is an IDE?
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is **software** designed to make **writing high-level languages** more **efficient**
- IDEs include tools and facilities to make the **process of creating/maintaining code easier,** such as:
    - **Editor**
    - **Error diagnostics**
    - **Run-time environment**
    - **Translators**
#### Editor
![ytHHel1c_replit1](media/ytHHel1c_replit1.png)

- An editor gives users an environment to **write, edit and maintain** high-level code
- Editors can provide:
    - **Basic code formatting tools** - changing the font, size of the font and making text bold etc
    - **Prettyprint** - using colour to make it easier to identify keywords, for example '`print`', '`input`' and '`if`' in Python
    - **Code editing** - auto-completion and auto-correction of code, bracket matching and syntax checks
    - **Commenting code** - allows sections of code to be commented out easily to stop it from being run or as comments on what the program is doing
        
#### Error-diagnostics
![LNW3hy4A_replit2](media/LNW3hy4A_replit2.png)
- Tools that help to **identify**, **understand** and **fix errors** in code, such as:
    - **Identifying errors** - highlight particular areas of code or provide direct error messages where the error may have appeared e.g. indentation errors etc
    - **Debugger** -  provide a 'step through' command which provides step by step instructions and shows what is happening to the code line by line, useful for finding **logic errors**
#### Run-time environment
![replit3](media/replit3.png)
- Gives users the ability **to run** and see the **corresponding output** of a high-level language
    
#### Translator
- Built in to **compile** or **interpret** code without the need for an extra piece of software
# IDE
consists of an editor with an interpreter and/or compiler and debugging tools
it also provides a run-time environment, this is where the outputs from the executed code is displayed

to check and correct errors tools are called debugging tools
the interpreter or compiler runs error diagnostics on the program when the programmer tries to save it
ex. syntax errors
when all syntax errors are corrected, the program can be ran and an IDE identifies any runtime errors.
**Break points**: stops program at that line to check values and outputs from the code to that point
**Variable watch window**: check values of variables as they change
**Stepping**: going through the code line by line to check it line by line

Editors
an editor is a tool to write, edit, and save code
it looks like a word processor
editors make the process of writing code simpler and more readable
**Prettyprint**: changes the color of words like commands and identifiers
**Auto-completion**: suggests options for you to select the correct one
**Auto-correction**:?
**Block minimizing**: minimize procedures or other sections of code so there is less code to read through

# **Run-time environment**
allows users to run a program on a platform that is different from the one in which it was created on
only runs programs, cannot edit

# task 1
An IDE allows you to edit code and provides quality of life features such as syntax coloring, error identification, and minimizing blocks of code.
A run-time environment allows you to run your program, on different platforms, but you cannot edit the program

I am pretty sure most, if not all, high-level languages can be used in an IDE and most definitely in a run-time environment
Examples can be
python IDLE and shell
c++ in vscode
clang for c++
gcc for c++
python in vscode
q/kdb in vscode
javascript in vscode
java in vscode
java in android studio
rust in vscode
lua in vscode

# task 2
IDEs have error diagnostics, translators, editor, and run-time environment
Error diagnostics helps debugging and testing programs
translators translate high-level languages into machine code so that it can be executed
editors allow easier writing and editing of code 
run-time environment allows you to run the code

An IDE is good at easier editing and maintaining code but cannot run the code by itself
A run-time environment runs the code but cannot edit

# task 3
There are AI assistants that I can use to autocomplete code or tell it to write code for me.
I can only run the selected portion of code
I have access to a terminal/console
I can install extensions
I can refer to other programs in other languages


# plenary
1.
compiler, interpreter, assembler
2.
compiler so she can distribute the code and not reveal the source code
3.
break points allow users to stop the program at a line to check outputs and values to that point
stepping allow users to run the code line by line to think about the code logic
