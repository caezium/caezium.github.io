a.
A graphical user interface using windows, icons, menus, and pointers, while a command line interface only use the keyboard and text commands.
b.
An advantage of using a GUI is that it is more intuitive and easier to pick up or use. A disadvantage of using a GUI is that you are limited to the set amount of controls.
c.
An advantage of using a CLI is that you are in direct communication with the computer, allowing you to do a lot of more things such as reconfiguring system settings. A disadvantage of using a CLI is that it takes more time to learn the specific commands and takes more time to type in commands.

g.
An interrupt will produce a signal that is sent to the CPU to suspend its current operation.

a.
An operating system allows the computer system to function correctly and allows human-computer interaction.
b.
virtual memory is a place where temporary data is stored which can be later deleted after that data isn't used anymore
c.
Disk thrashing occurs when a computer's performance slows significantly due to excessive swapping between RAM and virtual memory on the hard drive. 
d.
multitasking is where the computer seems to be do a lot of tasks at the same time. The processors are so fast, it seems like its doing multiple tasks at the same time, but it's really just completing one task very fast then doing another.
e.
an interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU to tell it to temporarily stop a process. This is used to effectively run multiple programs at the same time.

Running anti-virus software in the background on a computer will constantly check for virus attacks. Many smaller utilities check software for certain behavior which would indicate a possible virus; this is known as heuristic checking. Any possible files or programs which are infected are put into quarantine until deleted by the user or automatically deleted.
As a hard disk drive (HDD) becomes full, tracks used for data and files will become scattered over different blocks and sectors on the disk surface. A disk defragmenter will rearrange the blocks of data and files into contiguous sectors wherever possible, thus reducing the scattering of data. It also reduced the number of HDD infected.
Many computers use screensavers which automatically launch when a computer has been inactive for a period of time. They form part of the utility, so that a user is automatically logged out after a certain period of time and the utility will indicate that the computer is now locked.
