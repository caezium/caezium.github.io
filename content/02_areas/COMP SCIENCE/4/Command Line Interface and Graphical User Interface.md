CLI and GUI
The operating system allows the user to enter data and outputs data to the user, all through an interface.
Graphical user interfaces: has windows icons menus and pointers, WIMP, it is the most intuitive
Command Line Interface: users can enter specific text as commands
Natural language interface: allows users to enter any text or speech commands, the OS then analyses what has been entered and performs the action.

*What is a menu interface?*
- A menu interface is **successive menus** presented to a user with a **single option at each stage**
- Often performed with **buttons** or a **keypad**
- Examples include
    - **Chip and pin machines**
    - **Vending machines**
    - **Entertainment streaming services**
*What is a natural language interface?*
- A natural language interface (**NLI**) uses the spoken word to respond to spoken or textual inputs from a user
- Examples include
    - **Virtual assistants** - Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri
    - **Search engines**
    - **Smart home devices**

Recall
hardware is the collection of physical components that makes up a computer that interacts with [[software]] to provide functionality for users.

[[software]] refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It is non-physical, designed to interact with hardware and provide functionality for users.
[[Application software]] allows the user to perform a task, it provides services for the user, for example, writing a letter, viewing a website, etc.
- perform applications (apps) on a computer
- perform specific tasks using the computer's resources
[[System software]]
- set of programs to control and manage the operation of computer hardware
- provides a platform on which other software can runon
- required to allow hardware and [[software]] to run
- provides a human computer interface, HCI
- controls allocation and usage of hardware resources
- written in low-level assembly language or machine code
- runs any time the computer is on
- works in background, the user doesn't usually access it




little question
translate to python
```py
a = 0
b = 20
c = 2
while a>b:
	a+=c
	c+=1
```




# task 1
CLI: the user has to type in every instruction, and it has to be types in correctly, the user is in direct communication with the computer
GUI: the user does not have to learn any instructions

# task 2
A GUI is easier to use because they have intuitive design made for your average humans, they have been perfected over the years and that has made it very easy for people to use. Another advantage of using a GUI instead of a CLI is that with CLI's, you have to only use a keyboard and not a mouse, limiting a lot of functions. Users also have to learn and type in instructions correctly or else the CLI will not know what the user wants to do.

# task 3
GUI because the new employee has little technical knowledge and is just using the computer to do basic office tasks that should not require using a CLI and will be performed and learnt faster by using a GUI.
The IT administrator should use a CLI because configuring network settings and troubleshooting server issues require precise commands to check the system configuration and must use minimal computer resources. CLIs use a lot less resources than GUIs and it will be slower and harder to access and alter system configurations with a GUI because it was not designed to go that deep into a computer system.
