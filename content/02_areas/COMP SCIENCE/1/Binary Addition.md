- Why is it important for a programmer to be able to effectively debug a program?

It is important for a programmer to effectively debug a program or else it will be to hard and take a long time for you to find the error. With assisted debugging, programmers can find their errors quickly to reduce production time and make sure the work is up to quality, this decreases the firms production costs as well, generating them more revenue and shifting their supply curve outwards.

## task 1
00100110 + 01010111

  00100110
+01010111
\------------
01111101

## task 2
An overflow error is an error where after you add two binary numbers, the result is bigger than the preset size of the resulting answer.
So if you set the answer's bit size to 4 bits, and you add 1111 with 1111, it will overflow because the answer will be 32, which cannot be represented with 4 bits, instead it will be 0010 0000

## task 3
10101010 + 00101011 + 00101001

10101010
00101011
00101001
\=
11111110

## Plenary
   1  1    1 1
  00110011
+01100001
\------------
  10010100
