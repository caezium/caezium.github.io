Our brain is designed to process a maximum of about 120 bits per second, that's why it is so difficult to listen to two people talk to us at once!
As humans, we process data that is called analogue data, everything we see, hear, feel, and smell is a continuous stream of analogue data to our senses.
The components that process data in a computer are made up of very small **logic gates**, they can only **process** **digital data** and not analogue data. The data is stored in **registers**.
Digital data is discrete data that has only two values, **1 and 0.**

#### binary - base two number system
**1 represents on/true**
**0 represents off/false**

a computer contains millions and millions of these tiny switches, which can be turned on and off.

**increments of the powers of 2**

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 
0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0
#### denary - base ten number system
we use the denary number system in our daily lives, which has increments of the powers of 10.

to convert to binary you can start from the biggest term and subtract it until nothing remains

an alternative method is to divide by 2 and get the remainder to modulus 2

##### 8 bits is 1 byte, 4 bits is 1 nibble
###### things like Mb => megabit, is different to MB => megabyte, factor of 8

Recall
software is a collection of instructions, programs, and data that enable the computer to accomplish a specific task
system software can communicate with and control hardware, it is required for the computer to run software with hardware.
application software are programs that the user can choose to install to perform a task, it is a service.

## task 1
base-10  to binary
6 = 0110
9 = 1001

## task 2
58 = 00111010
123 = 01111011

## task 3
1111 = 2 ^ 4 -1 = 15
1111111111111111 = 2 ^ 16 -1 = 65536-1 =65,535 

## plenary
a) it is a base 2 system
b) 50 = 00110010
102 = 01101000
221 = 11011101

#### continued


## task 4
1001 = 9
1100 = 12

## task 5
01100011 = 99
11011001 = 9+128+64+16=217 

## task 6
0110 0010 10001001 = 9+128+512+8192+16384=25,225 

a) motor c on, motor d off, wheel c rotate backwards, wheel d does not rotate => car rotates around wheel d as the pivot and turns to the left, counter clockwise

b) 10100110 => the movements are cancelled out, the car does not move

## plenary
1) 10101110 = 14+32+128 =174 
2) A computer system can only process data in binary form because it is made up of small logic gates that can only accept the signals: on and off. In binary, there are only two states, 0 and 1, representing on and off, so the computer can process it, any more states then they can't.
