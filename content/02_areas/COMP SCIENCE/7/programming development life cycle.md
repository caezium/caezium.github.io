There are four stages in the program development life cycle
- Analysis
	- identify the problem
	- Abstract and decompose the problem.
	- Identify the requirements
- Design
	- consider how the program will be designed
	- overall structure and individual algorithms that may be used
	- /decomposition
- Coding/development
	- producing the program
	- iterative testing - test the programs as they are developed
- Testing
	- test the program
	- list out test data with their expected results and test if the program outputs the expected result.
	- fix the errors and re-test.


### extended writing
*does a hard disk drive weigh more when it is full or empty?*
a hard drive weights slightly more when it is full compared to when it is empty.

## Green task
*Describe the steps that allow you to think like a computer*
You abstract, then decomposition, then focus on algorithm design, reducing the big task into smaller and smaller tasks.
Abstraction, certain characteristics are removed so that you focus on the main and important characteristics.
Decomposition, a large problem is broken down into smaller tasks.
Algorithm design, a problem is broken into a series of logical steps called an algorithm, the steps are ran one by one and solves the problem.

*Describe how a problem can be decomposed into its component parts.*
A problem can be decomposed into its component parts by abstracting and decompositioning.

## Amber task
*In the Development cycle, which stage is computational thinking used*
Computational thinking is used in the Analysis and Design stage.

## Red task
*Deduce an algorithm to check whether a number is divisible by 6 or not write down the logic used in a flowchart or pseudocode*
```
DECLARE num : INTEGER
INPUT num
IF MOD(num, 6) = 0 THEN
	OUTPUT "divisible by 6"
ELSE
	OUTPUT "not divisible by 6"
ENDIF
```

## Plenary
1. Decomposition is when you break the problem down into smaller parts that are solvable by a computer
