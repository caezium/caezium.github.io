A trace table is a structure to help you follow an algorithm as the variables changes to find an error or to work out what the algorithm does.
Each column is for one variable and there is an extra column for outputs.
Each row follows a change in at least one of the variables
Multiple lines of outputs will be written on multiple rows

recall
there are four types of test data
normal, abnormal, extreme, and boundary

You can leave the table element blank if its the same value as before. For outputs on multiple lines, they should be written in multiple rows. Each column should be a single variable and an extra column for output. Each row should show at least one change in the value of a variable.


# plenary
We record values of variables and outputs as the programs runs in a trace tables.
We change the value in ca column when the value of the variable changes up to the corresponding row/line in the program.
