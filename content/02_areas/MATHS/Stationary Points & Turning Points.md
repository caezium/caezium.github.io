## Stationary Points & Turning Points

#### What are stationary points?

- A stationary point is any point on a curve where the gradient is zero
    
- To find stationary points of a function **f(**_**x**_**)**
    

**Step 1:** Find the first derivative **f'(**_**x**_**)**

**Step 2:** Solve **f'(**_**x**_**) = 0** to find the _x_-coordinates of the stationary points

**Step 3:** Substitute those _x_-coordinates into **f(**_**x**_**)** to find the corresponding _y_-coordinates

- A stationary point may be either a **local minimum**, a **local maximum**, or a **point of inflection**

#### Stationary points on quadratics

- The graph of a quadratic function (ie a parabola) only has a single stationary point
    
- For an 'up' parabola this is the **minimum**; for a 'down' parabola it is the **maximum** (no need to talk about 'local' here)

- The _**y**_ value of the stationary point is thus the minimum or maximum value of the quadratic function
    
- For quadratics especially minimum and maximum points are often referred to as **turning points**
    

#### How do I determine the nature of stationary points on other curves?

- For a function **f(**_**x**_**)** there are two ways to determine the nature of its stationary points 
    
- **Method A:** Compare the signs of the **first derivative** (positive or negative) a little bit **to either side of the stationary point**
    
    - (After completing **Steps 1 - 3 above** to find the stationary points)
        

**Step 4:** For each stationary point find the values of the first derivative a little bit 'to the left' (ie slightly smaller _x_ value) and a little bit 'to the right' (slightly larger _x_ value) of the stationary point

**Step 5:** Compare the **signs** (positive or negative) of the derivatives on the left and right of the stationary point

- If the derivatives are **negative** on the **left** and **positive** on the **right**, the point is a **local minimum**
    
- If the derivatives are **positive** on the **left** and **negative** on the **right**, the point is a **local maximum**
    
- If the signs of the derivatives are the **same** on both sides (both positive or both negative) then the point is a **point of inflection**

**Method B:** Look at the sign of the **second derivative** (positive or negative) **at the stationary point**

(After completing **Steps 1 - 3 above** to find the stationary points)

**Step 4:** Find the second derivative **f''(**_**x**_**)**

**Step 5:** For each stationary point find the value of **f''(**_**x**_**)** at the stationary point (ie substitute the _x_-coordinate of the stationary point into **f''(**_**x**_**)** )

- If **f''(**_**x**_**)** is **positive** then the point is a **local minimum**
    
- If **f''(**_**x**_**)** is **negative** then the point is a **local maximum**
    
- If **f''(**_**x**_**)** is **zero** then the point could be a **local minimum**, a **local maximum** OR a **point of inflection** (use Method A to determine which)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

- Usually using the second derivative (Method B above) is a much quicker way of determining the nature of a stationary point.
    
- However, if the second derivative is zero it tells you nothing about the point.
    
    - In that case you will have to use Method A (which **always** works – see the Worked Example).
