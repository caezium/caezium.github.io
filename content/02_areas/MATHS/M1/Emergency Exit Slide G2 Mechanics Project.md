# 🏫 SCIE 8-Floor Emergency Slide System (Hybrid Design)

## 1. **Upper Floors (8 → 4) – Spiral Tube Slides**
- **Design**: Enclosed spiral/tube slides (like the giant mall slides in China).  
- **Floors served**: 8, 7, 6, 5 → all feed into a **large 4th-floor evacuation platform**.  
- **Why tube slides?**
  - Fully enclosed → no risk of falling out.  
  - Curved path → naturally controls speed.  
  - Familiar design → students already know how to use them (like playground/mall slides).  
- **Multiple slides per floor**: At least 2–3 per floor to prevent congestion.  
- **Exit point**: All slides converge at a **reinforced 4th-floor platform** (fire-resistant, wide enough to hold many students).

## 2. **Lower Floors (4 → 0) – Expandable Airplane-Inspired Escape Chutes**
- **Design**: Straight inflatable/retractable slides (like airplane emergency slides).  
- **Floors served**: 4th floor platform → ground.  
- **Why inflatable chutes?**
  - Compact storage → only deploy in emergencies.  
  - Fast deployment (3–6 seconds).  
  - Wide, dual-lane chutes allow multiple students at once.  
- **Multiple chutes**: Several slides from the 4th floor to the ground to handle large numbers of students quickly.  
- **Landing zone**: Cushioned mats or inflatable pads at the bottom.

## 3. **Flow of Evacuation**
1. Students on **floors 8–5** → enter their floor’s **tube slide** → arrive at the **4th-floor platform**.  
2. Students on **floors 4–1** → go directly to the **4th-floor platform** via stairs or direct exits.  
3. From the **4th-floor platform**, everyone uses the **airplane-style inflatable chutes** to reach the ground.  

This creates a **two-stage evacuation system**:
- **Stage 1**: Controlled descent from upper floors (safe, enclosed, no free fall).  
- **Stage 2**: Rapid evacuation to ground (fast, multiple exits, airplane-proven design).

## 4. **Safety Features**
- **Enclosed tubes** → no risk of falling out.  
- **Multiple entry points** → reduces congestion.  
- **Inflatable side rails** on chutes → prevent falling off.  
- **Curved tube design** → keeps speeds safe.  
- **Soft landing zones** → mats or inflatable cushions.  
- **Fire-resistant materials** → fiberglass, coated PVC, or reinforced fabric.  
- **Emergency lighting** → glow strips inside tubes and chutes.

## 5. **Advantages of This Hybrid System**
✅ **Safety**: Spiral tubes slow descent, inflatable chutes are proven safe in aviation.  
✅ **Efficiency**: Multiple slides per floor + multiple chutes = fast evacuation.  
✅ **Space-saving**: Tubes wrap around the building, chutes deploy only when needed.  
✅ **Realism**: Inspired by **mall slides** (China) and **airplane slides** (aviation).  
✅ **Innovation**: Combines permanent + deployable systems.

# **��** **Emergency Exit Slide G2 Mechanics Project**  

**��****‍****��** **Project Introduction**

In this applied mathematics project, you will work in groups of **3 or 4** to design an **emergency exit slide** for the school. Acting as a team of engineers, your group will propose a realistic and safe solution that could be used in emergency situations. This project is part of the **Mechanics** unit in Mathematics, and it challenges you to apply your knowledge of **kinematics, forces, and friction** to create and justify your design using accurate **mathematical modeling and calculations**. You will also present your solution through a **PowerPoint presentation**, showcasing your teamwork, logic, and problem-solving skills. The goal is to think critically, work collaboratively, and bring math to life in a real-world scenario.

## **��** **Aims of the Project**

Students can apply their knowledge of kinematics, forces in two dimensions, and friction to create an emergency exit slide that allows a person to land safely at a target distance. You can analyze the forces involved, the angle of the ramp, and the materials needed to ensure safe operation. To make it life-related, you can research real exit slides and consider factors like environmental impact, safety considerations, and the applicability of such facilities in different contexts.

**��** **Rules and Deadlines**

· **Plagiarism**: Any instance of plagiarism will result in a grade of **0**.

· **First Draft Submission**:  
Week 6 (22nd–26th September), as decided by the subject teacher.

· **Extended Deadline**:  
Week 8 (6th–10th October).

o Work submitted late without an acceptable reason will receive a maximum of **50%** of the marks if handed in by the extended deadline.

o Work submitted **after** the extended deadline will receive a grade of **0**.

· **Group Project Presentation**:  
Week 9 (13th–17th October).

o Each group will present for **8–10 minutes**.

## **��️** **Task**

**A. Build emergency exit slides at SCIE campus. State the following clearly:**

1. Height and length of the exit slides

2. Safety measures you have considered in your design.

3. Any other assumptions and considerations such as friction coefficient used etc. (We can assume frictional coefficient to be constant throughout the motion to make it easier)

**B. Based on your design and considerations, using your knowledge from Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 in mechanics, please show clearly the calculations to support your design. You may simplify the model if the calculation is beyond your capability. It must include:**

a. The speed when each student reaches the bottom and whether it is within safety limit. (The medical team will be worried if it is too fast)

b. The total time to evacuate 30 students. (If it is too long, then walking the stairs will be preferred)

c. The forces the slide exerts on the wall as well as on the ground when it is in operation. (School property management needs to consider these)

d. Any other calculations and considerations such as costs.

**C. Using PowerPoint, do a short presentation of your group design, showing all the above information in your presentation. All the group members must present as presentation grade will be awarded individually.**

�� Hint: To make the calculations easier, you can make reasonable assumptions such as constant frictional coefficient and linear movement when going down the slope.
