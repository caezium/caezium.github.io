### What is discrete and continuous data?

- Numerical data (quantitative data) can be either **continuous** or **discrete**
    
- **Continuous data** can take **any numerical value** on a scale
    
    - e.g. height, length, weight, mass
        
    - For continuous data the measurements can become more and more accurate the more you 'zoom in'
        
- **Discrete data** can only take **particular numerical values** on a scale
    
    - Often these are integers 
        
        - e.g. numbers of people or objects
            
    - But they don't _have_ to be integers
        
        - e.g. shoe sizes, which include 'half sizes'
