#### What are triangle constructions?

- A **triangle construction** is an accurate drawing that usually uses:
    
    - a sharp **pencil**
        
    - a **ruler**
        
    - a **protractor**
        
    - and/or a pair of **compasses**
        
- You will be given information about the size of some of the **angles** and/or **sides** of a triangle
    
- Depending on the type of triangle, you will need to follow a specific method and you may need different equipment
    
- The types of triangle you may be asked to construct include: 
    
    - **SSS** - you are given the lengths of **all three sides**
        
    - **SAS** - you are given the lengths of **two sides** and the **angle in between them**
        
    - **ASA** - you are given the size of **two angles** and the length of the **side in between them**
        

### How do I construct an SSS triangle?

- **STEP 1**  
    Use a **ruler** to draw the **longest** side as the **horizontal** base near the bottom of the space you have been given
    
    - This needs to be **accurate**
        
    - Write its length (with units) just underneath
        

- **STEP 2**  
    Open your **compasses** so that the **length** from the **compass point to the tip of your pencil** is **exactly the length** of one of the **remaining sides**
    
    - Being extra careful not to change the length, put the compass point on one end of the horizontal line you have drawn and **draw an arc** above the horizontal line
        
    - You can draw a full circle rather than an arc if you prefer
        
- **STEP 3**  
    Open your **compasses** so that the length from the **compass point to the tip of your pencil** is **exactly the length** of the **third side**
    
    - Being extra careful not to change the length, put the compass point on the other end of the horizontal line and **draw another arc**, making sure that it **crosses the first arc**
        
- **STEP 4**
    
    Use your **ruler** to draw **straight lines** from each end of the horizontal line to the point **where the arcs cross**
    
- **STEP 5**  
    Use your **ruler** to **check** that the two new lines are **exactly equal** to the lengths given in the question
    
    - When you are confident that they are accurate, label the lines with their lengths and units
        

- **Do not rub out your arcs** as the examiner will use these to check your work
    
- Sometimes the instructions will include a **triangle name** such as triangle ABC
    
    - Make sure you label each vertex with the correct letters
