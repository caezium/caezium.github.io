#### What are constructions?
- A **construction** is a process where you create an accurate geometric object using a **pair of compasses** and a **straight edge** (and a pencil)
- There are several types of construction you must be able to carry out:
    - A **perpendicular bisector** of a line
        - This is a line that cuts another one exactly in half (**bisects**) but also crosses it at a right angle (**perpendicular**)
        - It shows a path that is **equidistant** (**equal distance**) between the two endpoints of the line
    - A **perpendicular from a point to a line**
        - This is the **shortest path** between the point and the line
        - It will meet the line at a right angle
    - An **angle bisector**
        - This is a line that **cuts an angle exactly in half** (**bisects**)
        - It shows a path that is **equidistant** (**equal distance**) between the two lines that form the angle
#### How do I construct a perpendicular bisector of a line?
- **STEP 1**  
    Set the **distance** between the point of the **compasses** and the pencil to be **more than half the length** of the line
- **STEP 2**  
    Place the point of the compasses **on one end** of the line and sketch an **arc** above and below the line
- **STEP 3**  
    Keeping your compasses **set to the same distance**, place the point of the compasses on **the other end of the line** and sketch an **arc** above and below the line
    - The **arcs should intersect** each other both above and below the line
- **STEP 4**  
    **Connect** the points where the arcs intersect with a **straight line**

#### How do I construct a perpendicular from a point to a line?
- **STEP 1**  
    Set the distance between the point of your compasses and the pencil to be **greater than the distance between the point P and the line**
- **STEP 2**  
    Placing the point of the compasses on the point P, draw an **arc** that **intersects the line in two places**
- **STEP 3**  
    Set the **distance** between the point of the **compasses** and the pencil to be **more than half the distance** between the two points of intersection on the line
- **STEP 4**  
    Place the point of the compasses **on one point of intersection** and sketch an **arc** on the opposite side of the line to P
- **STEP 5**  
    Keeping your compasses set to the same distance, place the point of the **compasses** on **the other point of intersection** and sketch an **another arc**
    - The **arcs should intersect**
- **STEP 6**  
    **Connect** the point where the arcs intersect to point P with a **straight line**

#### How do I construct an angle bisector?
- **STEP 1**  
    Set the **distance** between the point of your **compasses** and the pencil to be **about half** the distance of the smallest line that makes the angle
    - The precise distance is not important
- **STEP 2**  
    Place the **point** of the compasses where the **lines meet** and sketch an **arc** that **intersects both of the lines** that form the angle
- **STEP 3**  
    Keeping your compasses set to the same distance, place the point of the compasses on one of the **points of intersection** and sketch an arc    
- **STEP 4**  
    Keeping your compasses set to the same distance, place the point of the compasses on the **other point of intersection** and sketch an **arc**
    - This **should intersect** the last arc you drew
- **STEP 5**  
    Join the **point of the angle** to the **point of intersection** with a **straight line**
