## Sketching Gradient Functions

#### How can I sketch a function's gradient function?

- Using your knowledge of gradients and derivatives you can use the graph of a function to sketch the corresponding gradient function
    
- The behaviour of a function tells you about the behaviour of its gradient function

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

- If **f(**_**x**_**)** is a smooth curve then **f'(**_**x**_**)** will also be a smooth curve.
    
- Take what you know about **f'(**_**x**_**)** (based on the table above) and then 'fill in the blanks' in between.
    
- If all you have is the graph of **f(**_**x**_**)** you will not be able to specify the coordinates of the _y_-intercept or any stationary points of **f'(**_**x**_**).**
    
- Be careful â€“ points where **f(**_**x**_**)** cuts the _x_-axis don't tell you anything about the graph of **f'(**_**x**_**)**!
