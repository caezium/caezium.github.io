### Paper chromatography

>[!def] Chromatography is used to *separate substances* and *provide information* to help identify them

1. The components have different solubilities in a given solvent
2. A pencil line is drawn on chromatography paper and spots of the sample are placed on it
3. The paper is then lowered into the solvent container, making sure that the pencil line *sits above* the level of the solvent so the samples donâ€™t *wash into the solvent container*

- A pencil is used for this as *graphite is insoluble* in water.
- The solvent used is usually *water, ethanol*
- The solvent travels by *capillary action*, taking some of the coloured substances with it
- *different solubilities* , travel at *different rates* -> spread apart
- higher solubility -> travel further
