### Filtration
This technique is used **to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid**.
It can be used to obtain a product that is free from unreacted chemicals, by-products or solvent.

### Decantation (tilt it)
>  the process of separation of liquid from solid and other immiscible (non-mixing) liquids, by removing the liquid layer at the top from the layer of solid or liquid below.

### Evaporation/Crystallization
One way to separate a *soluble solid* from its solution is to make **crystals**. 
This involves evaporating the solution to a much smaller volume and then leaving it to cool. As the solution cools, crystals form, and these can be obtained by **filtration**.

### Simple distillation
Distillation separates a **liquid** from a solution.
> For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. 
> This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed in a condenser and collected in a separate container.
> The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.

### Fractional Distillation
> used when boiling points of the liquids are close and/or a higher degree of purity is required
- The solution is heated to the temperature of the substance with the **lowest** boiling point
    - This substance will rise and evaporate first
    - The vapours will pass through a condenser, where they cool and condense
    - The condensed liquid is then collected in a beaker
    - All of the substance is evaporated and collected, leaving behind the other component(s) of the mixture

### Paper chromatography

> Chromatography is used to *separate substances* and *provide information* to help identify them

1. The components have different solubilities in a given solvent
2. A pencil line is drawn on chromatography paper and spots of the sample are placed on it
3. The paper is then lowered into the solvent container, making sure that the pencil line *sits above* the level of the solvent so the samples don’t *wash into the solvent container*

- A pencil is used for this as *graphite is insoluble* in water.
- The solvent used is usually *water, ethanol*
- The solvent travels by *capillary action*, taking some of the coloured substances with it
- *different solubilities* , travel at *different rates* -> spread apart
- higher solubility -> travel further
