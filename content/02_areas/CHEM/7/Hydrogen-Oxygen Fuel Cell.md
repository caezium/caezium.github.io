# Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cell  

## How does a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell work?  
- A hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell converts **chemical energy** from hydrogen and oxygen into **electrical energy**.  
- Hydrogen gas is supplied to the **anode** and oxygen gas to the **cathode**.  
- The electrolyte allows the movement of ions but not gases.  
- Electrons flow through an **external circuit**, producing electricity.  
- The only by-product is **water** (and some heat).

## Labelled Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cell  
**Key features to label in a diagram:**  
- **Anode (negative electrode):** where hydrogen enters.  
- **Cathode (positive electrode):** where oxygen enters.  
- **Electrolyte:** allows ion transfer (often potassium hydroxide or proton exchange membrane).  
- **External circuit:** where electrons flow, powering a device.  
- **Water outlet:** where water is formed.

## Identification of Electrodes  
- **Anode (negative electrode):** Hydrogen is oxidised.  
- **Cathode (positive electrode):** Oxygen is reduced.

## Advantages of Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells  
- Produces **clean energy**: only water as a by-product.  
- **Efficient** compared to combustion engines.  
- Continuous supply of electricity as long as hydrogen and oxygen are provided.  
- Can be used in vehicles, spacecraft, and portable power sources.

## Disadvantages of Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells  
- **Hydrogen storage** is difficult (requires high pressure or low temperature).  
- Hydrogen production often relies on **fossil fuels** (not fully carbon-free).  
- Expensive technology (catalysts like platinum are costly).  
- Infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling is limited.
