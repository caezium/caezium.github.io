## Lewis Formulas
- **Lewis formulas** are simplified electron shell diagrams and show pairs of electrons around atoms.
- A pair of electrons can be represented by dots, crosses, a combination of dots and crosses or by a line. For example, chlorine can be shown as:

_**Different Lewis Formulas for chlorine molecules**_
- Note: Cl–Cl is not a **Lewis formula**, since it does not show all the electron pairs.
- The “**octet rule**” refers to the tendency of atoms to gain a valence shell with a total of 8 electrons
    

### Steps for drawing Lewis Formulas
1. Count the total number of **valence electrons**
2. Draw the **skeletal structure** to show how many atoms are linked to each other.
3. Use a pair of crosses or dot/cross to put an electron pair in each bond between the atoms.
4. Add more electron pairs to complete the octets around the atoms ( except H which has 2 electrons)
5. If there are not enough electrons to complete the octets, form double/triple bonds.
6. Check the total number of electrons in the finished structure is equal to the total number of **valence** electrons
