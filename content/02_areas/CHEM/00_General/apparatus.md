## Time, temperature, mass & volume

### Time

- Time can be measured using a **stopwatch** or stopclock which are usually accurate to one or two decimal places
    
- The units of time normally used are **seconds** or **minutes**
    
    - Other units may be used for extremely slow reactions (e.g. rusting)
        
- **Remember:** 1 minute = 60 seconds
    

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

**Careful:** Units of time often cause issues in results tables.

If the display on a stopwatch showed 1:30.

- The incorrect time to record would be 1.30 minutes.
    
- The correct time would be 1.5 minutes.
    

To avoid any confusion, if the time intervals are less than a minute, it is best / easire to change the recorded units to seconds.

- So, the same stopwatch display would be recorded as 90 seconds.
    

### Temperature

- Temperature is measured with a **thermometer** or digital **temperature probe**

- Laboratory thermometers usually have a precision of a half or one degree
    
    - Digital temperature probes are available which are more **precise** than traditional thermometers and can often read to 0.1 oC
        
- Traditional thermometers rely upon the uniform expansion and contraction of a liquid substance with temperature
    
    - Digital temperature probes can be just as, if not, more **accurate** than traditional thermometers
        
- The units of temperature are **degrees Celsius (ºC)**
    

### Mass

- Mass is measured using a **digital balance** which normally gives readings to two decimal places
    
    - Balances should be tared (set to zero) before use
        
    - Balances should also be allowed time to settle on a final measurement / reading before it is recorded

- The standard unit of mass in kilograms (kg)
    
    - However, in chemistry **grams (g)** are most often used
        
- **Remember:** 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
    

### Volumes of liquid

- The volume of a liquid can be determined using different pieces of apparatus
    
    - The choice of apparatus depends on the level of accuracy needed
        
- Three common pieces of apparatus for measuring the volume of a liquid are:
    
    - **Burettes**
        
    - **Volumetric pipettes**
        
    - **Measuring cylinders**
        

![[02_areas/CHEM/00_General/attachments/4843d90ad1e2558f42563c59b3f0bf90_MD5.png]]

- **Burettes** are the most accurate way of measuring a **variable** volume of liquid between 0 cm3 and 50 cm3
    
    - They are most commonly used in [titrations](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/chemistry/cie/23/revision-notes/12-experimental-techniques-and-chemical-analysis/12-1-experimental-techniques/12-1-3-acid-base-titrations/)
        
    - **Careful:** Read the burette scale from top to bottom as 0.00 cm3 is at the top of the column
        
- **Volumetric pipettes** are the most accurate way of measuring a **fixed** volume of liquid,
    
    - They have a scratch mark on the neck which is matched to the bottom of the meniscus to make the measurement
        
    - A pipette filler is used to draw the liquid into the volumetric pipette
        
    - The most common volumes for volumetric pipettes are 10 cm3 and 25 cm3
        
- **Measuring cylinders** are used when approximate volumes are required (accuracy is not an important factor)
    
    - These are graduated (have a scale so can be used to measure)
        
    - Measuring cylinders typically range from 10 cm3 to 1 litre (1 dm3)
        
- Whichever apparatus you use, you may see markings in millilitres, ml, which are the same as a cm3
    

### Volumes of gas

- For some experiments, the volume of a gas produced needs to be measured
    
- This is typically done by using one of the following methods:
    
    - Using a **gas** **syringe** 
        
    - By **downward displacement of water**
        
- A **gas syringe** is more precise and accurate than downward displacement of water

_**Diagram of the set-up for an experiment involving a gas syringe**_

- **Downward displacement of water** is where a **measuring cylinder** is inverted in water to collect the gas produced
    
    - This method does not work if the gas is soluble in water

- If the gas happens to be heavier than air and is coloured, the cylinder does not need to be inverted
    

## Advantages & disadvantages of methods & apparatus

- In the lab, we often have choices of different apparatus to do the same job
    
- Evaluating which piece of apparatus is the best one to use is part of good experimental planning and design
    
- This means appreciating some of the advantages and disadvantages of laboratory apparatus
    

#### Advantages and disadvantages of lab apparatus

|**Apparatus**|**Advantage**|**Disadvantage**|
|---|---|---|
|**Temperature probe**|- More precise readings<br>    <br>- Easy to make multiple repeat readings<br>    <br>- Can be automated to run over long periods of time|- Can be corroded by some reagents<br>    <br>    - More expensive (to replace)|
|**Volumetric pipette**|- Accurate measurement of a fixed volume|- Harder to use than a normal pipette<br>    <br>- Only measures one fixed volume|
|**Gas syringe**|- Easy to set up<br>    <br>- Keeps the gas dry|- The syringe can stick<br>    <br>- Collects limited volumes<br>    <br>- Expensive and delicate / fragile|
|**Microscale experiments**|- Less wasteful<br>    <br>- Saves energy<br>    <br>- Safer|- Hard to see what's happening<br>    <br>- Lose a lot of material separating / purifying the products|

_**Five pieces of apparatus that can be used to measure the volume of a liquid. They all have their pros and cons**_

### Planning your method

- Good experimental design includes the answers to questions like
    
    - Have I chosen a suitable apparatus for what I need to measure?
        
    - Is it going to give me results in an appropriate time frame?
        
    - Is it going to give me enough results to process, analyse and make conclusions?
        
    - Does it allow for repetitions to check how **reliable** my results are?
        
    - Does my plan give a suitable **range** of results?
        
    - How can I be sure my results are **accurate**?
        
    - Have I chosen an appropriate scale of quantities without being wasteful or unsafe?
        
- You may be asked about experimental methods in exam questions and your experience and knowledge of practical techniques in chemistry should help you to spot mistakes and suggest improvements
