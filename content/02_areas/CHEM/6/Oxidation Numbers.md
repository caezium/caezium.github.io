What are oxidation numbers?


>**An oxidation number is a number assigned to an atom in a compound or ion that shows how many electrons it has gained, lost, or shared compared to the atom in its elemental state.**

**Every atom and ion has an oxidation number that indicates:**
- The number of electrons it has gained or lost when bonded with other atoms
- Whether it has been oxidized or reduced


**Rules for oxidation numbers:**

- Uncombined elements have an oxidation number of 0
- Elements combined with identical atoms, like O2 and H2, also have an oxidation number of 0
- The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge
- Oxygen atoms typically have an oxidation number of -2, except in peroxides where it's -1
- Hydrogen atoms typically have an oxidation number of +1, but it's -1 in metal hydrides

For compounds and polyatomic ions, the sum of oxidation numbers equals the overall charge.

Worked example: Calculating oxidation numbers of compounds.

  
### Roman Numerals in Chemical Names

Roman numerals indicate the oxidation state of transition metals in compounds. Example: Iron(II) sulfate (Fe2+) vs. Iron(III) sulfate (Fe3+)

Copper(I) = Cu+ Copper(II) = Cu2+ Manganese(VII) = Mn7+ Iron(III) = Fe3+

## Identifying redox reactions

#### Identifying redox reactions using oxidation numbers

- The **oxidation number** is a number assigned to an atom or ion in a compound 
    
- It shows the number of electrons that an atom has lost, gained or shared in forming a compound
    
    - So, the oxidation number helps you to keep track of the movement of electrons in a redox process
        
- It is written as a +/- sign followed by a number
    
    - Positive oxidation number = loss of electrons
        
    - Negative oxidation number = gain of electrons
        
    - For example, aluminium in a compound usually has the oxidation number of +3 indicating it has lost 3 electrons
        
    - **Careful:** It is easy to confuse oxidation number with charge which is written by a number followed by a +/- sign)
        
- A few simple rules help guide you through the process of determining the oxidation number of any element
    

#### Rules for assigning oxidation numbers

||**Rule**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|The oxidation number of any uncombined element is zero|H2   <br>Zn  <br>O2|
|**2**|Many atoms or ions have fixed oxidation numbers in compounds|Group 1 elements are always +1  <br>Group 2 elements are always +2  <br>Fluorine is always –1  <br>Hydrogen is +1, except in hydrides like NaH where it is –1  <br>Oxygen is –2, except in peroxides where it is in –1 and in F2O where it is +2|
|**3**|The oxidation number of an element in a monoatomic ion is always the same as the charge|Zn2+ = +2  <br>Fe3+ = +3  <br>Cl– = –1|
|**4**|The sum of the oxidation numbers in a compound is zero|NaCl  <br>Na = +1  <br>Cl = –1  <br>Sum of oxidation numbers = 1 – 1 = 0|
|**5**|The sum of the oxidation numbers in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion|SO42–  <br>S = +6  <br>Four O atoms = 4 x (–2) = –8  <br>Sum of oxidation numbers = 6 – 8 = –2|
|**6**|In either a compound or an ion, the more electronegative element is given the negative oxidation number|F2O  <br>Two F atoms = 2 x (–1) = –2  <br>O = +2|

- Redox reactions can be identified by the changes in the **oxidation number** when a reactant goes to a product

Calculate the oxidation number of the carbonate ion CO32-. Carbon has an oxidation number of +4 and oxygen has an oxidation number of -2.

  

**Step 1: Identify the oxidation numbers of each element.**

Oxidation number of carbon = +4

Oxidation number of oxygen = -2

Oxidation number of O3 = 3 x -2 = -6

  

**Step 2: Calculate the overall oxidation number**

Overall oxidation number = -6 + 4 = -2

Using oxidation numbers to identify redox reactions

  

Oxidation numbers help identify what is oxidised and reduced:

- **Oxidation** - Results in a increase in oxidation number.
- **Reduction** - Results in a decrease in oxidation number.

  

**Oxidising and reducing agents**

- **Oxidising agents** - Compounds that promote the reduction of other substances while they themselves get oxidised.
- **Reducing agents** - Compounds that promote the oxidation of other substances while they themselves get reduced.

Examples of oxidising and reducing agents

  

**Potassium manganate(VII) (KMnO****4****)**

- Potassium manganate is a strong oxidising agent.
- When it reacts, the solution will change from purple to colourless.

  

**Potassium iodide (KI)**

- Potassium iodide is a reducing agent.
- When it reacts, the solution will change from colourless to brown.

  

The colour changes provide visual evidence of the oxidation and reduction taking place.

### Identifying redox reactions by colour changes

- The tests for redox reactions involve the observation of a colour change in the solution being analysed
    
- Two common examples are acidified potassium manganate(VII), and potassium iodide
    
- Potassium manganate(VII), KMnO4, is an **oxidising agent** which is often used to test for the presence of **reducing** agents
    
- When acidified potassium manganate(VII) is added to a reducing agent its colour changes from **purple** to **colourless**

_**Diagram to show the colour change when potassium manganate(VII) is added to a reducing agent**_

- Potassium iodide, KI, is a **reducing** agent which is often used to test for the presence of **oxidising** agents
    
- When added to an acidified solution of an oxidising agent such as aqueous chlorine or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the solution turns a **red-brown** colour due to the formation of iodine, I2

_**Diagram to show the colour change when potassium iodide is added to an oxidising agent**_

- The potassium iodide is oxidised as it loses electrons
    
- The hydrogen peroxide is reduced
    
- Therefore, potassium iodide is acting as a **reducing agent** 
    

## Oxidising & reducing agents

**Extended tier only**

### What is an oxidising agent?

- An oxidising agent is a substance that **oxidises** another substance, and becomes **reduced** in the process
    
- An oxidising agent **gains** electrons as another substance loses electrons
    
- Common examples include hydrogen peroxide, fluorine and chlorine
    

### What is a reducing agent?

- A reducing agent is a substance that **reduces** another substance, and becomes **oxidised** in the process
    
- A reducing agent **loses** electrons as another substance gains electrons
    
- Common examples include carbon and hydrogen
    
- The process of reduction is very important in the chemical industry as a means of extracting metals from their ores 
    

### Identifying oxidising and reducing agents

CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O

- Hydrogen is reducing the CuO
    
- Hydrogen is itself oxidised as it has gained oxygen / lost electrons
    
- So, the **reducing agent** is **hydrogen**:
    

H2 → 2H+ + 2e-

- CuO is reduced by hydrogen
    
    - This means that the hydrogen is oxidised by CuO
        
- CuO is reduced as it has lost oxygen / gained electrons
    
- So, the **oxidising** **agent** is **copper** **oxide**
    

Cu2+ +2e- →  Cu
