Redox reactions are chemical reactions where both oxidization and reduction occurs simultaneously. Electrons are transferred between substances, resulting in changes to oxidation states. The term "redox" combines the words "reduction" and "oxidation".

## **Common Ions and Their Colors**

Here’s a table of the most important ions and substances you should know for IGCSE:

|Ion/Substance|Color in Solution|Notes/Where Seen|
|---|---|---|
|**Cu²⁺**|Blue|Copper(II) sulfate, copper(II) nitrate|
|**Cu (metal)**|Brown/Red|Copper metal (solid)|
|**Fe²⁺**|Pale green|Iron(II) sulfate|
|**Fe³⁺**|Yellow/Brown|Iron(III) chloride, iron(III) nitrate|
|**Cl₂ (gas)**|Greenish-yellow|Chlorine gas|
|**MnO₄⁻ (in KMnO₄)**|Purple|Potassium permanganate|
|**Mn²⁺**|Colorless/pale pink|After reduction of MnO₄⁻|
|**Cr₂O₇²⁻**|Orange|Dichromate(VI)|
|**Cr³⁺**|Green|Chromium(III)|
|**I₂ (in solution)**|Brown|Iodine in water|
|**Br₂ (in solution)**|Orange-brown|Bromine in water|

## **Key Differences:**

- **Cold water:** Forms a **metal hydroxide** (alkaline solution).
- **Steam:** Forms a **metal oxide** (solid).

## What are Oxidation States?

>**An oxidation number is a number assigned to an atom in a compound or ion that shows how many electrons it has gained, lost, or shared compared to the atom in its elemental state.**

Oxidation states (or oxidation numbers) represent the hypothetical charge an atom would have if all bonds were 100% ionic. They help track electron transfers in redox reactions.

### Rules for Assigning Oxidation States:

Rule 1: Free elements have oxidation number of 0 (e.g., Na, Fe, O₂, Cl₂)

Rule 2: For monatomic ions, the oxidation number equals the charge (e.g., Na⁺ = +1, Cl⁻ = -1)

Rule 3: Oxygen typically has -2 (except in peroxides = -1)

Rule 4: Hydrogen typically has +1 (except in metal hydrides = -1)

Rule 5: The sum of all oxidation numbers in a compound equals the overall charge

### What is a redox reaction?

- A **redox** reaction is where oxidation and reduction take place together at the same time in the same reaction
    
- In terms of oxygen:
    
    - **Oxidation** is where **oxygen** is **added** to an element or a compound
        
    - **Reduction** is where **oxygen** is **removed** from an element or compound
        
- The reaction between zinc oxide and carbon is an example of a redox reaction  
    
    - Zinc oxide is reduced because it has **lost** oxygen
        
    - Carbon is oxidised because it has **gained** oxygen

_**Both reduction and oxidation has occurred in this reaction so it is classed as a redox reaction**_

Oxidation and reduction - **oxygen** or **electrons**?


The terms 'oxidation' and 'reduction' can be a bit confusing, because we can **describe them in terms of the gain / loss of oxygen, or the gain / loss of electrons.** 

In terms of oxygen: **oxidation is the gain of oxygen**, and reduction is the loss of oxygen.


For *electrons it's the opposite way around*. An easy way to remember it is by remembering the phrase **'OIL RIG'.**

**Oxidation Is Loss      Reduction Is Gain**

Just remember that OIL RIG only works *for electrons*, not oxygen.

### [[02_areas/CHEM/6/Oxidation Numbers|Oxidation Numbers]]

Using oxidation numbers to identify redox reactions

  

Oxidation numbers help identify what is oxidised and reduced:

- **Oxidation** - Results in a increase in oxidation number.
- **Reduction** - Results in a decrease in oxidation number.

  

**Oxidising and reducing agents**

- **Oxidising agents** - Compounds that promote the reduction of other substances while they themselves get oxidised.
- **Reducing agents** - Compounds that promote the oxidation of other substances while they themselves get reduced.





Examples of oxidising and reducing agents

  

**Potassium manganate(VII) (KMnO****4****)**

- Potassium manganate is a strong oxidising agent.
- When it reacts, the solution will change from purple to colourless.

  

**Potassium iodide (KI)**

- Potassium iodide is a reducing agent.
- When it reacts, the solution will change from colourless to brown.

  

The colour changes provide visual evidence of the oxidation and reduction taking place.

### Roman Numerals in Chemical Names

Roman numerals indicate the oxidation state of transition metals in compounds. Example: Iron(II) sulfate (Fe2+) vs. Iron(III) sulfate (Fe3+)

Copper(I) = Cu+ Copper(II) = Cu2+ Manganese(VII) = Mn7+ Iron(III) = Fe3+

## Oxidizing & Reducing Agents

**Oxidizing Agent**

A substance that causes oxidation by accepting electrons from another substance.

It is itself reduced in the process.

Examples: KMnO4, MnO4-, O2, F2

**Reducing Agent**

A substance that causes reduction by donating electrons to another substance.

It is itself oxidized in the process.

Examples: Na, Mg, Zn, Fe, H2, C
