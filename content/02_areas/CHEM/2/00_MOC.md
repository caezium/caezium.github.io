> [!def] Ion
> an atom or [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Molecule|molecule]] with a net electric charge unequal to zero due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons
_cations_: positive [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] 
_anions_: negative [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]], **-ide** in name.
#### [[Ionic bonding]]

> - Metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] **lose**, non-metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] **gain** their *outer electrons* to form [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]]
> - The positive and negative [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] are held together by strong **electrostatic [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] of** **attraction** between **opposite** charges
> - This form of attraction is very **strong** and requires a lot of [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome
    - This causes high melting points in ionic compounds
#### Lattice structure
- Ionic compounds have a **giant lattice** structure (**no [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Molecule|molecule]]** because it has no units)
- the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] are arranged in an **ordered** and **repeating** fashion
![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/f796aa6e8cc740860fff0aa74505eb9b_MD5.png]]
##### Properties
- They have **high** melting and boiling points
- The **greater** the *charge* on the [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]], the **stronger** the *electrostatic forces* and the **higher** the *melting point* will be
> - *good* conductors of electricity in the **molten** state or in **solution** -> **because the [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] are able to move and carry a charge**
> - *poor* conductors in the **solid state**

> [!def] covalent bond
> **pairs** of electrons are **shared** between [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]]
> 
- **Covalent** bonding occurs between two **non-metals**
- A covalent bond involves the **electrostatic** **attraction** between nuclei of two [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] and the electrons of their outer shells
- **No** **electrons** are **transferred** but only **shared** in this type of bonding
- When a covalent bond is formed, two **atomic orbitals** overlap and a **molecular orbital** is formed
- [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Covalent Bonding|Covalent bonding]] happens because the electrons are more stable when attracted to two nuclei than when attracted to only one
![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/67919902377e78ad0ec5ef1bad3b39a5_MD5.jpeg]]

- Sharing electrons in the covalent bond allows each of the 2 [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] to achieve an [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Electron|electron]] configuration similar to a noble [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Gas|gas]]
    - This makes each atom more **stable**
- The **octet rule** refers to the tendency of [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] to gain a valence shell with a total of 8 electrons

- Covalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules or giant molecules
- When two or more [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] are **covalently** bonded together, we describe them as ‘**molecules**’
#### [[Simple Molecules]]
- Simple molecular structures have covalent bonds joining the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] together, but intermolecular forces that act between neighboring molecules are weak
    
- They have relatively **low melting and boiling points** because: 
    - There are weak intermolecular [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] between the molecules
    - These [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] require little [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome 
- Most simple molecular structures are either gases or liquids at room [[02_areas/PHYSICS/2/Temperature|temperature]] 
- They can be solids with low melting and boiling points but this is less common
- As the molecules increase in size, the melting and boiling points generally increase because the strength of these intermolecular [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] increases and so more [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] is needed to break them 

![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/196ffb5612e374acaf8c9301c84753c9_MD5.png]]Simple molecular structures are **poor conductors** of electricity (even when molten) because:
- There are **no** free [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] or electrons to move and carry the charge.
- Most covalent compounds do not conduct at all in the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Solid|solid]] state and are thus insulators
- Common insulators include the plastic coating around household electrical wiring, rubber and wood

#### 2.6 [[Giant Covalent Structures]]

![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/7f2d2affa471529241b43a2dc2063df5_MD5.jpeg]]

- [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Giant Covalent Structures|Giant covalent structures]] are **solids** with **high melting points**
- They have a huge number of non-metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] bonded to other non-metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] via strong covalent bonds
- These structures can also be called **giant lattices** and have a fixed ratio of atoms in the overall structure

- Three examples include diamond, graphite and C60 fullerene
- All giant covalent structures have **high melting points** because
    - There are strong covalent bonds between atoms
    - These require lots of [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome

- Graphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene and graphene are **allotropes** of carbon

> [!def] metallic bond
> the strong force of **attraction** between the positive metal ions and the delocalised electrons
- Metals consist of **giant** structures
- Within the metal lattice, the atoms lose their outer electrons and become positively charged metal **ions**
![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/f2872d2afcbcf107d337cb55c94e6faf_MD5.jpeg]]

- **high melting and boiling points** 
    - strong electrostatic forces of attraction which needs lots of energy to be broken 
- Metals are **good conductors of heat and electricity** 
    - The *delocalized* electrons are free to move and carry a charge through the whole structure 
![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/a554ba1c76f26878bd71769674f92a1a_MD5.jpeg]]
- Most metals are **malleable**(opposite. *brittle*)
    - This means they can be hammered into shape
    - This is because the atoms are arranged in layers which can slide over each when force is applied
