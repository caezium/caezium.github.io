## Metallic bonding
> [!def] the strong force of **attraction** between the positive metal [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] and the delocalised electrons
- Metals consist of **giant** structures
- Within the metal lattice, the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] lose their outer electrons and become positively charged metal **[[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]]**
    - The outer electrons no longer belong to any specific metal atom and are said to be **delocalised**
    - This means they can move freely between the positive metal [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] and act like a _“sea of electrons”_

### Properties

- **high melting and boiling points** 
    - strong electrostatic [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] of attraction which needs lots of [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to be broken 
- Metals are **good conductors of heat and electricity** 
    - The *delocalized* electrons are free to move and carry a charge through the whole structure

- Most metals are **malleable**(opposite. *brittle*)
    - This means they can be hammered into shape
    - This is because the atoms are arranged in layers which can slide over each when force is applied
