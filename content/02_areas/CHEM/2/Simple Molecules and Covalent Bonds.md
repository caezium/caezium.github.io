## [[Covalent Bonding]]
> [!def] **pairs** of electrons are **shared** between [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]]
> 
- **Covalent** bonding occurs between two **non-metals**
- A covalent bond involves the **electrostatic** **attraction** between nuclei of two [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] and the electrons of their outer shells
- **No** **electrons** are **transferred** but only **shared** in this type of bonding
- When a covalent bond is formed, two **atomic orbitals** overlap and a **molecular orbital** is formed
- [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Covalent Bonding|Covalent bonding]] happens because the electrons are more stable when attracted to two nuclei than when attracted to only one

- Sharing electrons in the covalent bond allows each of the 2 [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] to achieve an [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Electron|electron]] configuration similar to a noble [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Gas|gas]]
    - This makes each atom more **stable**
- The **octet rule** refers to the tendency of [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] to gain a valence shell with a total of 8 electrons

- Only **non-metal** **elements** participate in [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Covalent Bonding|covalent bonding]]
- each atom gains a **full** **outer** **shell** of electrons
- Covalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules or giant molecules
- When two or more [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] are **covalently** bonded together, we describe them as ‘**molecules**’

## [[Simple Molecules]]
- Simple molecular structures have covalent bonds joining the atoms together, but intermolecular forces that act between neighboring molecules are weak
    
- They have relatively **low melting and boiling points** because: 
    - There are weak intermolecular forces between the molecules
    - These forces require little energy to overcome 
- Most simple molecular structures are either gases or liquids at room temperature 
- They can be solids with low melting and boiling points but this is less common
- As the molecules increase in size, the melting and boiling points generally increase because the strength of these intermolecular forces increases and so more energy is needed to break them 

![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/196ffb5612e374acaf8c9301c84753c9_MD5.png]]Simple molecular structures are **poor conductors** of electricity (even when molten) because:
- There are **no** free ions or electrons to move and carry the charge.
- Most covalent compounds do not conduct at all in the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Solid|solid]] state and are thus insulators
- Common insulators include the plastic coating around household electrical wiring, rubber and wood

_**The plastic coating around electrical wires is made from covalent substances that do not allow a flow of charge**_
