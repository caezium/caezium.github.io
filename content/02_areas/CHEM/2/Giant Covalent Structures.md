- Giant covalent structures are **solids** with **high melting points**
- They have a huge number of non-metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] bonded to other non-metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] via strong covalent bonds
- These structures can also be called **giant lattices** and have a fixed ratio of [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] in the overall structure

- Three examples include diamond, graphite and C60 fullerene
- All giant covalent structures have **high melting points** because
    - There are strong covalent bonds between [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]]
    - These require lots of [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome

- **Covalent bonds** are bonds between nonmetals in which electrons are **shared** between the atoms
- In some cases, it is not possible to satisfy the bonding capacity of a substance in the form of a molecule; the bonds between atoms continue indefinitely, and a large lattice is formed. There are no individual molecules and [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Covalent Bonding|covalent bonding]] exists between all adjacent [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]]
- Such substances are called **giant covalent substances**, and the most important examples are [[02_areas/CHEM/00_General/Periodic Element/Carbon|C]] and SiO$_{2}$
- Graphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene and graphene are **allotropes** of carbon


**Giant Covalent (Macromolecular) Structures**: solids with very high melting points, where all the atoms are made of pure carbon.
