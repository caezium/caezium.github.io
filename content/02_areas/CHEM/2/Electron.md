| Name     | Charge | Mass             | Location        | Role                       |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Proton   | +1     | 1                | Inside Nucleus  | Determine the identity     |
| Neutron  | 0      | 1                | Inside Nucleus  | Hold together the nucleus  |
| Electron | -1     | $\frac{1}{1840}$ | Outside Nucleus | responsible for reactivity |
|          |        |                  |                 |                            |
 - Negatively charged electrons occupy the space outside the nucleus
    - They can be described as orbiting the nucleus where they create a '**cloud**' of negative charge
        
- The **electrostatic attraction** between the **positive nucleus** and **negatively charged electrons** orbiting around it is what holds an atom together
