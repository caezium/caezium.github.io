- Most elements exist naturally as a mixture of their isotopes. Using the data on the abundance of these naturally occurring isotopes, we can calculate the mass relative atomic mass of the element.    
- The formula:
    **Percentage of Isotope number 1** * **Its mass** + isotope 2 +...
    divided by
    number of total isotopes
so it is the average of the naturally occurring isotopes and their masses
