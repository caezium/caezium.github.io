- Simple molecular structures have covalent bonds joining the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] together, but intermolecular [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] that act between neighboring molecules are weak
    
- They have relatively **low melting and boiling points** because: 
    - There are weak intermolecular [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] between the molecules
    - These [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] require little [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome 
- Most simple molecular structures are either gases or liquids at room [[02_areas/PHYSICS/2/Temperature|temperature]] 
- They can be solids with low melting and boiling points but this is less common
- As the molecules increase in size, the melting and boiling points generally increase because the strength of these intermolecular forces increases and so more [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] is needed to break them

Simple molecular structures are **poor conductors** of electricity (even when molten) because:
- There are **no** free [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] or electrons to move and carry the charge.
- Most covalent compounds do not conduct at all in the [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Solid|solid]] state and are thus insulators
- Common insulators include the plastic coating around household electrical wiring, rubber and wood

_**The plastic coating around electrical wires is made from covalent substances that do not allow a flow of charge**_
