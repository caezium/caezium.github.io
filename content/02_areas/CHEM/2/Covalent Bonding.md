> [!def] **pairs** of electrons are **shared** between [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]]
> 
- **Covalent** bonding occurs between two **non-metals**
- A covalent bond involves the **electrostatic** **attraction** between nuclei of two [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] and the electrons of their outer shells
- **No** **electrons** are **transferred** but only **shared** in this type of bonding
- When a covalent bond is formed, two **atomic orbitals** overlap and a **molecular orbital** is formed
- Covalent bonding happens because the electrons are more stable when attracted to two nuclei than when attracted to only one

- Sharing electrons in the covalent bond allows each of the 2 atoms to achieve an electron configuration similar to a noble gas
    - This makes each atom more **stable**
- The **octet rule** refers to the tendency of atoms to gain a valence shell with a total of 8 electrons

- Only **non-metal** **elements** participate in covalent bonding
- each atom gains a **full** **outer** **shell** of electrons
- Covalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules or giant molecules
- When two or more atoms are **covalently** bonded together, we describe them as ‘**molecules**’
