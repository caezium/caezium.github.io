### Homogeneous or hetergeneous
- A **homogeneous** [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Mixture|mixture]] has uniform composition and properties throughout
- A **heterogeneous** [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Mixture|mixture]] has non-uniform composition, so its properties are not the same throughout
- It is often possible to see the separate components in a **heterogeneous** **mixture**, but not in a **homogeneous mixture**
