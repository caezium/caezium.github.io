## [[Ions]]

> [!def] an atom or [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Molecule|molecule]] with a net electric charge unequal to zero due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons

- An atom is **neutral** and has no overall charge  
- [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|Ions]] on the other hand have either **gained** or **lost** electrons causing them to become **charged**

_cations_: positive [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]] 
_anions_: negative [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Ions|ions]], **-ide** in name.

## [[Ionic bonding]]

> - Metal [[02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms|atoms]] **lose**, non-metal atoms **gain** their *outer electrons* to form ions
> - The positive and negative ions are held together by strong **electrostatic [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Forces|forces]] of** **attraction** between **opposite** charges

---
### Ionic bond
> [!def] **the force of attraction between oppositely charged species / ions**
- **Cations** and **anions** are oppositely charged and therefore attracted to each other
- **Electrostatic** **attractions** are formed between the oppositely charged ions to form **ionic** **compounds**
- This form of attraction is very **strong** and requires a lot of [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] to overcome
    - This causes high melting points in ionic compounds

### Examples
$$Na^+ + Cl^- \to NaCl$$
$$Mg^{2+} + O^{2-} \to MgO$$
### Lattice structure
- Ionic compounds have a **giant lattice** structure (**no molecule** because it has no units)
- the atoms are arranged in an **ordered** and **repeating** fashion
![[02_areas/CHEM/2/attachments/f796aa6e8cc740860fff0aa74505eb9b_MD5.png]]
### Properties
- They have **high** melting and boiling points
- The **greater** the *charge* on the ions, the **stronger** the *electrostatic forces* and the **higher** the *melting point* will be
> - *good* conductors of electricity in the **molten** state or in **solution** -> **because the ions are able to move and carry a charge**
> - *poor* conductors in the **solid state**
