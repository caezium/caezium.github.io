- The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called the **electronic configuration**
- Electrons are arranged around the nucleus in **principal [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] levels** or **principal quantum shells**
- **Principal quantum numbers (n)** are used to number the energy levels or quantum shells
    - The **lower** the principal quantum number, the closer the shell is to the nucleus
    - The **higher** the principal quantum number, the greater the energy of the electron within that shell
- Each principal quantum number has a **fixed** number of electrons it can hold
    - n = 1 : up to 2 electrons
    - n = 2 : up to 8 electrons        
    - n = 3 : up to 18 electrons        
    - n = 4 : up to 32 electrons
    - $2n^2$
- The [[02_areas/PHYSICS/1/Energy|energy]] levels of the shells increase as their distance from the nucleus increases.
