## The Nuclear Atom
### What are subatomic particles?
- The **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons** that an atom is made up of are called **subatomic particles**
- These subatomic particles are so small that it is not practical to measure their masses and charges using **conventional units** (such as grams or coulombs)    
- Instead, their masses and charges are compared to each other, and so are called ‘**relative atomic masses**’ and ‘**relative atomic charges**’
- These are not actual charges and masses, but rather charges and masses of particles relative to each other
    - Protons and neutrons have a very similar mass, so each is assigned a relative mass of **1**
    - Electrons are 1836 times smaller than a proton and neutron, and so their mass can be considered negligible
**Proton/Atomic Number**: Number of Protons
**Relative Atomic Mass**: Number of Protons + Neutrons

**Number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number**
### Where are the subatomic particles located?
- Atoms contain a **positively charged**, **dense** nucleus
    - The nucleus is positively charged due to the protons
    - The nucleus is dense because mass of an atom is **concentrated** in the nucleus, which contains the heaviest subatomic particles
    - The subatomic particles in the nucleus can generally be called **nucleons**, although they are specifically the neutrons and protons
- Negatively charged electrons occupy the space outside the nucleus
    - They can be described as orbiting the nucleus where they create a '**cloud**' of negative charge
        
- The **electrostatic attraction** between the **positive nucleus** and **negatively charged electrons** orbiting around it is what holds an atom together
