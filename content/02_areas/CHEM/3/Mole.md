The **Avogadro Constant** (L or N$_{A}$) is the number of particles equivalent to the relative atomic mass or molecular mass of a substance in grams.
Avogadro Constant = $6.02 \cdot 10^{23} mol^{-1}$

The **mass** of a substance with this number of particles is called its **molar mass**
- *One mole* of a substance contains the same number of fundamental units as there are atoms in exactly 12.00 g of 12C
- If you had 6.02 x $10^{23}$ atoms of carbon-12 in your hand, you would have a mass of exactly 12.00 g
- One mole of water would have a mass of (2 x 1.01 + 16.00) = 18.02 g



- Since atoms are so small, any sensible laboratory quantity of substance must contain a huge number of atoms
- Such numbers are not convenient to work with, so using **moles** is a better unit to deal with the sort of quantities of substance normally being measured
- When we need to know the number of particles of a substance, we usually count the number of **moles**
**Particles = Moles x L**

#### Relative atomic mass, $A_{}r$
- The **relative** **atomic** **mass** ($A_{r}$) of an element is the weighted average mass of one atom compared to one twelfth the mass of a carbon-12 atom
- The relative atomic mass is determined by using the weighted average mass of the **isotopes** of a particular element
- Relative atomic mass has **no units** as it is a ratio and the units cancel each other out

#### Relative formula mass, $M_{r}$ 
- The **relative formula mass** ($M_{r}$) is used for compounds containing **ions**
- It is calculated in the same way as **relative** **molecular** **mass**
- In the table above, the $M_{r}$ for potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and ammonium sulfate are relative formula masses
