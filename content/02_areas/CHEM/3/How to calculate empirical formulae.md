### How to calculate empirical formulae

- Empirical formula calculations are very methodical
    
- Use a table and the following steps to complete an empirical formula calculation:
    
    1. Write the element
        
    2. Write the value given for each element
        
        - This may be given as a mass, in g, or as a percentage
            
        - There are exam questions where you are required to calculate the value of one of the elements
            
    3. Write the relative atomic mass of each element
        
    4. Calculate the moles of each element
        
        - Moles =Â ![mass over A subscript r](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2241%22%20width%3D%2240%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2223%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmsub%3E%3Cmi%3EA%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmi%3Er%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmsub%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3Etext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2236.5%22%20y1%3D%2218.5%22%20y2%3D%2218.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2219.5%22%20y%3D%2213%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2217.5%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EA%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2210%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2224.5%22%20y%3D%2237%22%3Er%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)
            
    5. Calculate the ratio of elements
        
        - Divide all the moles by the smallest number of moles
            
        - If you get a ratio that does not have whole numbers, you multiply by an appropriate number to make all the values into whole numbers
            
    6. Write the final empirical formula
