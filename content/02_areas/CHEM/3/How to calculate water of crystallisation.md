### Deducing formulae of hydrated salts

- A hydrated salt is a crystallised salt that contains water molecules as part of its structure
    
- The formula of a hydrated salt shows the water molecules, e.g. CuSO4•2H2O
    
    - The • symbol shows that the water present is water of crystallisation
        
- The formula of hydrated salts can be determined experimentally by:
    
    - Weighing a sample of the hydrated salt
        
    - Heating it until the water of crystallisation has been driven off
        
        - This is achieved by heating until a constant mass
            
    - Re-weighing the anhydrous salt
        
- From the results, you can determine the mass of anhydrous salt and the mass of the water of crystallisation
    
- Applying a similar approach to deducing empirical formulae, the formula of the hydrated salt can be calculated
    
### How to calculate water of crystallisation

- The steps for empirical formula can be adapted for hydrated salt / water of crystallisation calculations 
    
    - Instead of writing elements, write the two components of a hydrated salt
        
        - The salt
            
        - Water
            
    - Instead of writing relative atomic mass, write the relative molecular / formula mass of the salt and water
        
- Use a table and the following steps to complete the calculation:
    
    1. Write the salt and water
        
    2. Write the value given for the salt and water 
        
        - There are exam questions where you are required to calculate one of these values
            
    3. Write the relative molecular / formula mass of the salt and water
        
    4. Calculate the moles of the salt and water
        
        - Moles = ![begin mathsize 14px style mass over M subscript r end style](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2241%22%20width%3D%2240%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2223%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmsub%3E%3Cmi%3EM%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmi%3Er%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmsub%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3Etext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2236.5%22%20y1%3D%2218.5%22%20y2%3D%2218.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2219.5%22%20y%3D%2213%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2217.5%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EM%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2210%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2225.5%22%20y%3D%2237%22%3Er%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)
            
    5. Calculate the ratio salt : water 
        
        - Divide all the moles by the smallest number of moles
            
        - The calculation should give a ratio of **1** salt : _**x**_ water
            
    6. Write the final hydrated salt formula
