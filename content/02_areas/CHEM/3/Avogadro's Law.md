## Avogadro's Law

### Volumes of gases
- In 1811 the Italian scientist Amedeo **Avogadro** developed a theory about the volume of gases
- **Avogadro’s law** (also called **Avogadro’s hypothesis)** enables the mole ratio of reacting gases to be determined from volumes of the gases
- **Avogadro** deduced that equal volumes of gases must contain the same number of molecules


- At standard temperature and pressure(**STP**) **one mole** of any gas has a volume of **22.7 dm****3**
- The units are normally written as **dm****3** **mol****-1**(since it is 'per mole')    
- The conditions of **STP** are
    - a temperature of **0****o** **C** (**273 K**)
    - pressure of **100 kPa**

- At **Room Temperature and Pressure (RTP)**, one mole of any gas has a volume of **24 dm3**
	- the conditions are
	- pressure of 1ATM - 100kPa
	- temperature of 298k = 25 degrees Celsius

### Stoichiometric relationships
- The stoichiometry of a reaction and **Avogadro's Law** can be used to deduce the **exact** **volumes** of gaseous reactants and products
    
    - Eg. in the **combustion** of 50 cm3 of propane, the volume of oxygen needed is (5 x 50) 250 cm3, and (3 x 50) 150 cm3 of carbon dioxide is formed, using the ratio of propane: oxygen: carbon dioxide, which is 1: 5: 3 respectively, as seen in the equation

- Remember that if the gas volumes are not in the same ratio as the coefficients then the amount of product is determined by the limiting reactant so it is essential to identify it first
