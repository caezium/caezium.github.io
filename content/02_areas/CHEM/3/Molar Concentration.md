### Volumes & concentrations of solutions
- The **concentration** of a solution is the amount of **solute** dissolved in a **solvent** to make 1 dm3 of **solution**
    - The solute is the substance that dissolves in a solvent to form a solution
    - The solvent is often water
        
- A **concentrated** solution is a solution that has a **high** concentration of solute
- A **dilute** solution is a solution with a **low** concentration of solute

- Concentration is usually expressed in one of three ways:
    - moles per unit volume
    - mass per unit volume
    - parts per million
        

### Moles per unit volume
- The formula for expressing concentration using moles is:

- You must make sure you change cm3 to dm3  (by dividing by 1000)
### Mass per unit volume
- Sometimes it is more convenient to express concentration in terms of mass per unit volume    
- The formula is:

To change a concentration from mol dm-3 to g dm-3  
- Multiply the moles of solute by its molar mass
    

_**mass of solute (g) = number of moles (mol) x molar mass (g mol**__**-1**__**)**_

### Parts per million

- When expressing extremely low concentrations a unit that can be used is **parts per million** or **ppm**
    
- This is useful when giving the concentration of a pollutant in water or the air when the absolute amount is tiny compared to the volume of water or air
    
- **1 ppm** is defined as
    
    - A mass of **1 mg** dissolved in **1 dm****3** of water
        
- Since 1 dm3 weighs 1 kg we can also say it is
    
    - A mass of **1 mg** dissolved in **1 kg** of water, or 10-3 g in 103 g which is the same as saying the concentration is **1 in 10****6** or **1 in a million**
