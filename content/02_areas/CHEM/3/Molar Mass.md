- Since atoms are so small, any sensible laboratory quantity of substance must contain a huge number of atoms
- Such numbers are not convenient to work with, so using **moles** is a better unit to deal with the sort of quantities of substance normally being measured
- When we need to know the number of particles of a substance, we usually count the number of **moles**

L = Avogadro Constant = 6.02 x 10\^23 mo\^-1
Moles = Particles/L
**Particles = Moles x L**

### Moles and Mass
- We count in **moles** by weighing the mass of substances
- The number of **moles** can be calculated by using a formula triangle
- The **molar mass** of a substance is its relative atomic mass, Ar, or its relative formula mass, _M_r expressed in grams 
- Molar mass has the units **g mol****-1**

Mass = Moles x M
M = molar mass in g mol\^-1 => relative to Ar or Mr in grams
