### How to calculate molecular formula

- Molecular formula gives the **actual numbers of atoms of each element** present in the formula of the compound
    

**Table showing the relationship between empirical and molecular formulae**

|**Compound**|**Empirical formula**|**Molecular formula**|
|---|---|---|
|**Methane**|CH4|CH4|
|**Ethane**|CH3|C2H6|
|**Ethene**|CH2|C2H4|
|**Benzene**|CH|C6H6|

- To calculate the molecular formula:
    
    1. Find the relative formula mass of the empirical formula
        
        - Add the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in the empirical formula
            
    2. Use the following equation:
        
        - ![fraction numerator relative space formula space mass space of space molecular space formula over denominator relative space formula space mass space of space empirical space formula end fraction](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2239%22%20width%3D%22272%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2224%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20class%3D%22wrs_chemistry%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmrow%3E%3Cmi%3Erelative%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eformula%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eof%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Emolecular%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eformula%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmrow%3E%3Cmrow%3E%3Cmi%3Erelative%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eformula%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eof%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eempirical%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%3Eformula%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmrow%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3Etext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%22268.5%22%20y1%3D%2219.5%22%20y2%3D%2219.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2225.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Erelative%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2275.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Eformula%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22119.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22146.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Eof%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22186.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Emolecular%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22244.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Eformula%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2228.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Erelative%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2278.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Eformula%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22122.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22149.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Eof%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22187.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Eempirical%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22242.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Eformula%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)




            
    3. Multiply the number of each element present in the empirical formula by the number from step 2 to find the molecular formula
