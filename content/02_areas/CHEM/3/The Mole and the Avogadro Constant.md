## The [[Mole]]

## Reacting masses
- Chemical/symbol equations can be used to calculate:
    - The **moles** of reactants and products     
    - The **mass** of reactants and products
    
- To do this:
    - Information from the question is used to find the amount in moles of the substances being considered
    - Then, the **ratio** between the substances is identified using the balanced chemical equation
    - Once the moles have been determined they can then be converted into grams using the relative atomic or relative formula masses

### Limiting reactants

- A chemical reaction stops when one of the reactants is used up
    
- The reactant that is used up first is the **limiting reactant**, as it limits the duration and hence the amount of product that a reaction can produce
    
    - The one that is remaining is the **excess** reactant
        
    - The limiting reagent is the reactant which is **not present in excess** in a reaction
        
- The amount of product is therefore **directly proportional** to the amount of the limiting reactant added at the beginning of a reaction
    

### Determining the limiting reactant

- In order to determine which reactant is the limiting reagent in a reaction, we have to consider the amounts of each reactant used and the molar ratio of the balanced chemical equation
    
- When performing reacting mass calculations, the limiting reagent is always the number that should be used, as it indicates the maximum possible amount of product that can form
    
    - Once all of a limiting reagent has been used up, the reaction cannot continue
        
- The steps are:
    
    1. Convert the mass of each reactant into moles by dividing by the molar masses
        
    2. Write the balanced equation and determine the molar ratio
        
    3. Look at the equation and compare the moles

## Calculating empirical & molecular formulae

- The **empirical** **formula** is the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms of each element present in one molecule or formula unit of the compound

    - E.g. the empirical formula of ethanoic acid is CH2O
        

### How to calculate empirical formulae

- Empirical formula calculations are very methodical
    
- Use a table and the following steps to complete an empirical formula calculation:
    
    1. Write the element
        
    2. Write the value given for each element
        
        - This may be given as a mass, in g, or as a percentage
            
        - There are exam questions where you are required to calculate the value of one of the elements
            
    3. Write the relative atomic mass of each element
        
    4. Calculate the moles of each element
        
        - Moles = ![mass over A subscript r](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2241%22%20width%3D%2240%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2223%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmsub%3E%3Cmi%3EA%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmi%3Er%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmsub%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3Etext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2236.5%22%20y1%3D%2218.5%22%20y2%3D%2218.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2219.5%22%20y%3D%2213%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2217.5%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EA%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2210%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2224.5%22%20y%3D%2237%22%3Er%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)
            
    5. Calculate the ratio of elements
        
        - Divide all the moles by the smallest number of moles
            
        - If you get a ratio that does not have whole numbers, you multiply by an appropriate number to make all the values into whole numbers
            
    6. Write the final empirical formula

### How to calculate molecular formula

- Molecular formula gives the **actual numbers of atoms of each element** present in the formula of the compound
    

**Table showing the relationship between empirical and molecular formulae**

|**Compound**|**Empirical formula**|**Molecular formula**|
|---|---|---|
|**Methane**|CH4|CH4|
|**Ethane**|CH3|C2H6|
|**Ethene**|CH2|C2H4|
|**Benzene**|CH|C6H6|

- To calculate the molecular formula:
    
    1. Find the relative formula mass of the empirical formula
        
        - Add the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in the empirical formula
            
    2. Use the following equation:

### Deducing formulae of hydrated salts

- A hydrated salt is a crystallised salt that contains water molecules as part of its structure
    
- The formula of a hydrated salt shows the water molecules, e.g. CuSO4•2H2O
    
    - The • symbol shows that the water present is water of crystallisation
        
- The formula of hydrated salts can be determined experimentally by:
    
    - Weighing a sample of the hydrated salt
        
    - Heating it until the water of crystallisation has been driven off
        
        - This is achieved by heating until a constant mass
            
    - Re-weighing the anhydrous salt
        
- From the results, you can determine the mass of anhydrous salt and the mass of the water of crystallisation
    
- Applying a similar approach to deducing empirical formulae, the formula of the hydrated salt can be calculated
    

### How to calculate water of crystallisation

- The steps for empirical formula can be adapted for hydrated salt / water of crystallisation calculations 
    
    - Instead of writing elements, write the two components of a hydrated salt
        
        - The salt
            
        - Water
            
    - Instead of writing relative atomic mass, write the relative molecular / formula mass of the salt and water
        
- Use a table and the following steps to complete the calculation:
    
    1. Write the salt and water
        
    2. Write the value given for the salt and water 
        
        - There are exam questions where you are required to calculate one of these values
            
    3. Write the relative molecular / formula mass of the salt and water
        
    4. Calculate the moles of the salt and water
        
        - Moles = ![begin mathsize 14px style mass over M subscript r end style](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2241%22%20width%3D%2240%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2223%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmi%3Emass%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmsub%3E%3Cmi%3EM%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmi%3Er%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmsub%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3Etext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%7D%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2236.5%22%20y1%3D%2218.5%22%20y2%3D%2218.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2219.5%22%20y%3D%2213%22%3Emass%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2217.5%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EM%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2210%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2225.5%22%20y%3D%2237%22%3Er%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

### Percentage yield

- **Yield** is the term used to describe the amount of **product** you get from a reaction
    
- For economic reasons, the objective of every chemical producing company is to have as high a percentage yield as possible to increase profits and reduce costs and waste
    
- In practice, you **never** get 100% yield in a chemical process for several reasons
    
- These include:
    
    - Some reactants may be left behind in the **equipment**
        
    - The reaction may be **reversible** and in these reactions a high yield is never possible as the products are continually turning back into the reactants
        
    - Some products may also be lost during **separation** and **purification** stages such as filtration or distillation
        
    - There may be **side reactions** occurring where a substance reacts with a gas in the air or an **impurity** in one of the reactants
        
    - Products can also be lost during **transfer** from one container to another
        

#### How to calculate percentage yield

- **Percentage yield** compares the actual yield to the theoretical yield
    
- The equation for percentage yield is:
    

**percentage yield =** ![fraction numerator bold actual bold space bold yield over denominator bold theoretical bold space bold yield end fraction bold space bold cross times bold space bold 100](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2239%22%20width%3D%22169%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2224%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmrow%3E%3Cmi%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3Eactual%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3Eyield%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmrow%3E%3Cmrow%3E%3Cmi%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3Etheoretical%3C%2Fmi%3E%3Cmo%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmi%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3Eyield%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmrow%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3Cmo%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmo%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E%26%23xD7%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmo%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E%26%23xA0%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmn%20mathvariant%3D%22bold%22%3E100%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3E%40font-face%7Bfont-family%3A'math13b8a614226a953a8cd9526fca6'%3Bsrc%3Aurl(data%3Afont%2Ftruetype%3Bcharset%3Dutf-8%3Bbase64%2CAAEAAAAMAIAAAwBAT1MvMi7iBBMAAADMAAAATmNtYXDEvmKUAAABHAAAADRjdnQgDVUNBwAAAVAAAAA6Z2x5ZoPi2VsAAAGMAAAAl2hlYWQQC2qxAAACJAAAADZoaGVhCGsXSAAAAlwAAAAkaG10eE2rRkcAAAKAAAAACGxvY2EAHTwYAAACiAAAAAxtYXhwBT0FPgAAApQAAAAgbmFtZaBxlY4AAAK0AAABn3Bvc3QB9wD6AAAEVAAAACBwcmVwa1uragAABHQAAAAUAAADSwGQAAUAAAQABAAAAAAABAAEAAAAAAAAAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgICAAAAAg1UADev96AAAD6ACWAAAAAAACAAEAAQAAABQAAwABAAAAFAAEACAAAAAEAAQAAQAAANf%2F%2FwAAANf%2F%2F%2F8qAAEAAAAAAAABVAMsAIABAABWACoCWAIeAQ4BLAIsAFoBgAKAAKAA1ACAAAAAAAAAACsAVQCAAKsA1QEAASsABwAAAAIAVQAAAwADqwADAAcAADMRIRElIREhVQKr%2FasCAP4AA6v8VVUDAAACAIAAVQLVAoAAAwAHAEYYsAEUALEAABMQsQAJ5LEAARMQsAQ8sQYI9LACPDABsQgBExCxAAP2sAc8sQEF9bAGPLIFBwAQ9LACPLEJA%2BaxBAX1sAM8EzMBIxEzASOAVQIAVVX%2BAFUCgP3VAiv91QAAAQAAAAEAANV4zkFfDzz1AAMEAP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FWOhNz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F9Y6E3MAAP8gBIADqwAAAAoAAgABAAAAAAABAAAD6P9qAAAXcAAA%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%2BgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQcRAACNhRgAsgAAABUUE7EAAT8%3D)format('truetype')%3Bfont-weight%3Anormal%3Bfont-style%3Anormal%3B%7Dtext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%22114.5%22%20y1%3D%2219.5%22%20y2%3D%2219.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2240.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Eactual%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2282.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3Eyield%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2239.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Etheoretical%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2297.5%22%20y%3D%2235%22%3Eyield%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22math13b8a614226a953a8cd9526fca6%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22129.5%22%20y%3D%2224%22%3E%26%23xD7%3B%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20font-weight%3D%22bold%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%22154.5%22%20y%3D%2224%22%3E100%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)



















- **Actual yield** is the recorded amount of product obtained
    
- **Theoretical yield** is the amount of product that would be obtained under perfect practical and chemical conditions
    
    - Typically, this involves a [reacting mass calculation](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/chemistry/cie/23/revision-notes/3-stoichiometry/3-2-the-mole-and-the-avogadro-constant/3-2-3-reacting-masses/) based on the balanced symbol equation

- For example, in water:
    
    - Water is a simple molecule with the chemical formula H2O
        
    - So, water is made of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom
        
    - From the Periodic Table, the relative atomic mass of:
        
    - Hydrogen = 1
        
    - Oxygen = 16
        
- Therefore, the total mass of water is:
    
    - (2 × 1) + 16 = 18
        
- To find the percentage composition of hydrogen:
    
    - Percentage of hydrogen = ![fraction numerator 2 cross times 1 over denominator 18 end fraction](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2238%22%20width%3D%2237%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2224%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%20style%3D%22font-family%3AArial%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2214px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmrow%3E%3Cmn%3E2%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmo%3E%26%23xD7%3B%3C%2Fmo%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmrow%3E%3Cmn%3E18%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3E%40font-face%7Bfont-family%3A'math13b8a614226a953a8cd9526fca6'%3Bsrc%3Aurl(data%3Afont%2Ftruetype%3Bcharset%3Dutf-8%3Bbase64%2CAAEAAAAMAIAAAwBAT1MvMi7iBBMAAADMAAAATmNtYXDEvmKUAAABHAAAADRjdnQgDVUNBwAAAVAAAAA6Z2x5ZoPi2VsAAAGMAAAAl2hlYWQQC2qxAAACJAAAADZoaGVhCGsXSAAAAlwAAAAkaG10eE2rRkcAAAKAAAAACGxvY2EAHTwYAAACiAAAAAxtYXhwBT0FPgAAApQAAAAgbmFtZaBxlY4AAAK0AAABn3Bvc3QB9wD6AAAEVAAAACBwcmVwa1uragAABHQAAAAUAAADSwGQAAUAAAQABAAAAAAABAAEAAAAAAAAAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgICAAAAAg1UADev96AAAD6ACWAAAAAAACAAEAAQAAABQAAwABAAAAFAAEACAAAAAEAAQAAQAAANf%2F%2FwAAANf%2F%2F%2F8qAAEAAAAAAAABVAMsAIABAABWACoCWAIeAQ4BLAIsAFoBgAKAAKAA1ACAAAAAAAAAACsAVQCAAKsA1QEAASsABwAAAAIAVQAAAwADqwADAAcAADMRIRElIREhVQKr%2FasCAP4AA6v8VVUDAAACAIAAVQLVAoAAAwAHAEYYsAEUALEAABMQsQAJ5LEAARMQsAQ8sQYI9LACPDABsQgBExCxAAP2sAc8sQEF9bAGPLIFBwAQ9LACPLEJA%2BaxBAX1sAM8EzMBIxEzASOAVQIAVVX%2BAFUCgP3VAiv91QAAAQAAAAEAANV4zkFfDzz1AAMEAP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FWOhNz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F9Y6E3MAAP8gBIADqwAAAAoAAgABAAAAAAABAAAD6P9qAAAXcAAA%2F7YEgAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgNSAFUDVgCAAAAAAAAAACgAAACXAAEAAAACAF4ABQAAAAAAAgCABAAAAAAABAAA3gAAAAAAAAAVAQIAAAAAAAAAAQASAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAOABIAAAAAAAAAAwAwACAAAAAAAAAABAASAFAAAAAAAAAABQAWAGIAAAAAAAAABgAJAHgAAAAAAAAACAAcAIEAAQAAAAAAAQASAAAAAQAAAAAAAgAOABIAAQAAAAAAAwAwACAAAQAAAAAABAASAFAAAQAAAAAABQAWAGIAAQAAAAAABgAJAHgAAQAAAAAACAAcAIEAAwABBAkAAQASAAAAAwABBAkAAgAOABIAAwABBAkAAwAwACAAAwABBAkABAASAFAAAwABBAkABQAWAGIAAwABBAkABgAJAHgAAwABBAkACAAcAIEATQBhAHQAaAAgAEYAbwBuAHQAUgBlAGcAdQBsAGEAcgBNAGEAdABoAHMAIABGAG8AcgAgAE0AbwByAGUAIABNAGEAdABoACAARgBvAG4AdABNAGEAdABoACAARgBvAG4AdABWAGUAcgBzAGkAbwBuACAAMQAuADBNYXRoX0ZvbnQATQBhAHQAaABzACAARgBvAHIAIABNAG8AcgBlAAADAAAAAAAAAfQA%2BgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQcRAACNhRgAsgAAABUUE7EAAT8%3D)format('truetype')%3Bfont-weight%3Anormal%3Bfont-style%3Anormal%3B%7Dtext%7Bfill%3A%23000000%3B%3C%2Fstyle%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2233.5%22%20y1%3D%2219.5%22%20y2%3D%2219.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%227.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3E2%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22math13b8a614226a953a8cd9526fca6%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2218.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3E%26%23xD7%3B%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2229.5%22%20y%3D%2214%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2214%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2218.5%22%20y%3D%2234%22%3E18%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)
