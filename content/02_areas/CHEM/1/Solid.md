#### States of Matter

	orderly arranged
	closely packed
	vibrate/rotate at fixed position
	
**solid** melts

- Particles in a solid...
    - Are **closely packed**
    - Are arranged in a fixed pattern (**lattice structure**)
    - Can only **vibrate** about their fixed positions
    - Have **low energies** compared to particles in liquids and gases
    - Therefore, do **not** have enough energy to **overcome** the **intermolecular forces** of attraction holding them together

_**In a solid, particles are arranged in a fixed pattern, with no spaces between them, and are only able to vibrate about their fixed positions**_

- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, solids...
    - Have a fixed shape (although some solids can be deformed when [[forces]] are applied)
    - Have a fixed volume
    - Are very difficult to compress
    - Have higher **densities** than liquids and gases
