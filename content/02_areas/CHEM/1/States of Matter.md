Chemistry is the study of how **[[Matter]]** behaves and its properties.

>[!def] [[Matter]]
[[Matter]] is anything that has mass and takes up space.

**[[Atoms]]** are building blocks of [[Matter]]. It's the smallest unit of an element with all properties of the element. 
**[[02_areas/CHEM/2/Element|element]]** - made of a unique kind of atom
**Compounds** - made of two or more different kinds of [[02_areas/CHEM/2/Element|Element|elements]] bonded together.

pure substances - same [[Atoms]]/molecules
[[02_areas/CHEM/2/Mixture]] - [[Atoms]] and molecules are next to each other, but not bonded together

**vapor** - can be compressed to a liquid. unlike gas.

### Kinetic Particle Theory

#### States of [[Matter]]
**solid** melts, freezes **liquid** evaporates, condenses **gas**

| Property        | Solid  | Liquid    | Gas       |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| shape           | fixed  | not fixed | not fixed |
| volume          | fixed  | fixed     | not fixed |
| compressability | cannot | cannot    | can       |
solid
	orderly arranged
	closely packed
	vibrate/rotate at fixed position
liquid
	disorderly arranged
	can slide about
gas
	spread far apart
	move rapidly in any direction, high kinetic energy

#### Boiling points. Melting points
related to heat/energy
energy -> work -> increase temperature
temperature -> heat moves from hot to cold

When additional heat energy is supplied, the particles move faster and separate from one another to form into a new state with a more random arrangement of the **same** particles.

If you heat liquid water using a stove, heat energy is transferred from the stove to the water
	heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system
	the liquid water is said to absorb the energy
if you cool liquid water in the freezer, the heat energy is transferred from the liquid water to the freezer
	heat is transferred from the water to the surroundings
	the liquid water is said to release energy

*Why is steam so hot??*
The steam condenses on your hand and releases heat energy, freezing/cooling releases heat energy.

*How is evaporation different from boiling?*
Evaporation and sublimation involves particles at the surface getting sufficient energy to escape from the surface.
	evaporation of a liquid may occur at temperatures below the boiling temperature if the liquid is in a container that is open so that the gas can escape.
Boiling occurs when all the particles (including in the middle of the liquid) have sufficient energy to escape into the gas phase.

| boiling                      | evaporation                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| occurs only at boiling point | occurs at temperatures below boiling point |
| occurs throughout the liquid | occurs only at the surface of the liquid   |
| occurs rapidly               | occurs slowly                              |
when condensing, gas particles get attracted/stuck onto the liquid because it is slower.
melting points
cooling -> energy is given out by the particles -> lose energy move slower -> no longer have energy to move freely -> settle down into fixed positions.
heat -> move more separate -> overcome the forces of attraction holding them together.

[[Motion]]: vibration, rotate, dislocation

inter molecular forces
solids 
strong IMF


Sublimation -> solid to gas without turning to liquid, result of vapor pressure and temperature relationships



heating curve stops after reach points because the energy we put in are used to break the intermolecular forces.
