Particles in a [[gas]]...  
- Are **far apart** (the average distance between the particles is ∼10 times greater than the distance between the particles in solids and liquids)
- Are **randomly** arranged
- Move around in **all directions** at a variety of speeds, occasionally **colliding** with each other and with the walls of the container they are in
- Are negligible in size compared to the volume occupied by the [[gas]]
- Have **higher energies** than particles in solids and liquids
- Therefore, have enough energy to overcome the **intermolecular [[forces]]** of attraction holding them together

_**In a gas, particles can move around freely in all directions (shown by the arrows)**_

- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, gases...    
    - Do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are held in
    - Do not have a fixed volume and expand to completely fill the available volume
    - Can be compressed
    - Have the lowest densities (∼1000 times smaller than the densities of solids and liquids)
