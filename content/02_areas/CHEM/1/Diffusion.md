The Kinetic Particle Theory can be used to explain Diffusion.
> [!def] Diffusion
> The movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

$\text{Diffusion\ rate} \cdot \text{molecular\ mass} = k$



### more temp also means faster rate of diffusion because particles move faster
### Effect of relative molecular mass on the rate of diffusion of gases.
The rate at which a gas diffuses depends upon its relative molecular mass. 
Gases with a lower molecular mass diffuse faster than those with higher molecular masses.

| Gas               | Relative molecular mass |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Hydrogen          | 2                       |
| Helium            | 4                       |
| Methane           | 16                      |
| Ammonia           | 17                      |
| Carbon monoxide   | 28                      |
| Nitrogen          | 28                      |
| Oxygen            | 32                      |
| Hydrogen chloride | 36.5                    |
| Carbon dioxide    | 44                      |
| Chlorine          | 71                      |

# Diffusion of liquids
diffusion can also take place in liquids
