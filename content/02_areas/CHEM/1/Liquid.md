Particles in a [[liquid]]...  
- Are **closely packed**
- Are **randomly** arranged (i.e. there is no fixed pattern)
- Can **flow** past each other
- Have **higher energies** than particles in solids, but lower energies than [[gas]] particles
- Therefore, have enough [[energy]] to **partially overcome** the **intermolecular [[forces]]** of attraction holding them together

_**In a liquid, particles are arranged randomly and are able to flow past one another**_
- As a result of the arrangement and behaviour of their particles, liquids...
    - Do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are held in
    - Have a fixed volume
    - Are difficult to compress
    - Have lower densities than solids, but higher densities than gases
