Carbon and Hydrogen in the Reactivity Series

Carbon and hydrogen are non-metals included in the reactivity series because they can displace metals below them. Carbon is placed between aluminum and zinc, while hydrogen is between lead and copper.

## Reactivity series

### What is the reactivity series of metals?

- The chemistry of the metals is studied by analysing their reactions with water and acids
    
- Based on these reactions a reactivity series of metals can be produced
    
- The series can be used to place a group of metals in **order of reactivity** based on the observations of their reactions with water and acids
    
- The non-metals hydrogen and carbon are also included in the reactivity series as they are used to extract metals from their oxides

## Understanding Displacement Reactions

A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from its compounds in solution.

### Reaction of metals with cold water

- The more reactive metals will react with cold water to form a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas
    
- Potassium, sodium and calcium all undergo reactions with cold water as they are the most reactive metals:
    

metal + water →  metal hydroxide + hydrogen

-  For example, calcium and potassium:
    

Ca (s) + 2H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g)

2K (s) + 2H2O (l) → 2KOH (aq) + H2 (g)

### Reactions of metals with steam

- Metals just below calcium in the reactivity series do not react with cold water but will react with steam to form a metal oxide and hydrogen gas, for example, magnesium:
    

Mg (s) + H2O (g)  →  MgO (s) + H2 (g)

### Reaction with dilute acids

- Only metals **above hydrogen** in the reactivity series will react with dilute acids
    
- Unreactive metals below hydrogen, such as gold, silver and copper, do not react with acids
    
- The more reactive the metal then the more vigorous the reaction will be
    
- Metals that are placed high on the reactivity series such as potassium and sodium are very dangerous and react **explosively** with acids
    
- When acids react with metals they form a **salt** and **hydrogen gas:**
    
- The general equation is:
    

**metal + acid ⟶ salt + hydrogen**

- Some examples of metal-acid reactions and their equations are given below:
    

#### Acid-Metal Reactions Table 

|**Metal**|**Sulfuric acid**|**Hydrochloric acid**|
|---|---|---|
|Magnesium|Mg + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + H2|Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2|
|Zinc|Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2|Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2|
|Iron|Fe + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2|Fe + 2HCl → FeCl2 + H2|

### Reaction with oxygen

- Some reactive metals, such as the alkali metals, react easily with oxygen
    
- Silver, copper and iron can also react with oxygen although much more slowly
    
- When metals react with oxygen a metal oxide is formed, for example, copper:
    

metal + oxygen → metal oxide 

2Cu (s) + O2 (g) → 2CuO (s)

- Gold does not react with oxygen
    

### Deducing the order of reactivity

- The order of reactivity of metals can be deduced by making experimental observations of reactions between metals and water, acids and oxygen
    
- The more vigorous the reaction of the metal, the higher up the reactivity series the metal is
    
- A combination of reactions may be needed, for example, the order of reactivity of the more reactive metals can be determined by their reactions with water
    
- The less reactive metals react slowly or not at all with water, so the order of reactivity would need to be determined by observing their reactions with dilute acid
    
- Temperature change in a reaction can also be used to determine the order of reactivity
    
- The greater the temperature change in a reaction involving a metal, the more reactive the metal is

## Explaining reactivity

**Extended tier only** 

- Metal atoms form **positive ions** by loss of electrons when they react with other substances
    
- The **tendency** of a metal to lose electrons is a measure of how reactive the metal is
    
- A metal that is high up on the series loses electrons easily and is thus **more reactive** than one which is lower down on the series
    

### Displacement reactions between metals and aqueous solutions of metal salts

- Any metal will displace another metal that is **below** it in the reactivity series from a solution of one of its salts
    
- This is because more reactive metals lose electrons and form ions more readily than less reactive metals, making them better **reducing agents**
    
- The less reactive metal is a better electron acceptor than the more reactive metal, thus the less reactive metal is reduced 
    
    - OILRIG: reduction is gain of electrons
        

### Magnesium + copper sulfate

- Magnesium is a reactive metal and can displace copper from a copper sulfate solution
    
- Magnesium loses its electrons more easily and the ion of the less reactive metal, copper, will gain these electrons to form elemental copper
    
- This is easily seen as the more reactive metal slowly **disappears** from the solution, **displacing** the less reactive metal
    

**magnesium + copper sulfate → magnesium sulfate + copper**

**Mg (s) + CuSO****4** **(aq) → MgSO****4** **(aq) + Cu (s)**

- The blue colour of the CuSO4 solution **fades** as colourless magnesium sulfate solution is formed
    
- Copper coats the surface of the magnesium and also forms solid metal which falls to the bottom of the beaker
    

#### The reaction between magnesium and copper sulfate

_**Diagram showing the colour change when magnesium displaces copper from copper sulfate**_

- By combining different metals and metal salts solutions it is possible to come up with a relative reactivity order
    

**Metal Solutions Displacement Table**

|**Mixture**|**Products**|**Equation for Reaction**|
|---|---|---|
|Magnesium and iron(II) sulfate|Magnesium sulfate and iron|Mg + FeSO4 → MgSO4 + Fe|
|Zinc and iron chloride|Zinc chloride and iron|Zn + FeCl2 → ZnCl2 + Fe|
|Iron and silver nitrate|Iron(II) nitrate and silver|Fe + AgNO3 → Fe(NO3)2 + 2Ag|
|Copper and iron(II) chloride|No reaction|------|
|Silver and copper(II) sulfate|No reaction|------|
|Zinc and magnesium chloride|No reaction|------|

- From this table we can deduce the order of reactivity:
    
    - Magnesium and zinc are both more reactive than iron but magnesium is more reactive than zinc
        
    - Copper and silver are both less reactive than iron but silver is less reactive than copper
        
- The order of reactivity of the metals tested can be therefore be deduced as:
    
    - Mg > Zn > Fe > Cu > Ag
        

### Reactivity of aluminum

- Aluminum is high in the reactivity series, but in reality, it does not react with water and the reaction with dilute acids can be quite slow
    
- This is because it reacts readily with oxygen, forming a protective layer of aluminium oxide which is very thin
    
- This layer prevents reaction with water and dilute acids, so aluminium can behave as if it is unreactive
