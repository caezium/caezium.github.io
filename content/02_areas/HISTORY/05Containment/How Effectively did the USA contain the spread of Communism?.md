Domino Effect - coined by Eisenhower -> Policy of Containment
If one falls to communism, more will follow
Area of concern right now is Asia.

## Why was the US involved?
*geopolitical advantage*
*domino effect - China already turned also*
*containment*
*set an example -> using UN and UN will militarily intervened if aggressive*

| Domino Theory        | The USA wanted to stop Korea from falling to Communism. They believed that if Korea fell, **Japan would be next**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Truman Doctrine      | In **1947**, Truman declared that the USA would **protect any country in threat of a Communist uprising**. The US public put pressure on the government to protect South Korea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Belief in victory    | The US government believed that **China would not react if they sent troops to Korea**.

##### **Part B Practice**
**Why did the US intervene in the War?**
The US mainly intervened to stop communism from spreading because they believed in the Domino Theory. The Domino Theory states that if one country falls in Asia, other will follow. So, they do not want South Korea to fall to prevent other countries from falling into communism next, as per the containment policy.

Another reason the US intervened was to activate the United Nations. It is seen as North Koreans were the unprovoked aggressors, and to stop the mistakes the LON previously did of appeasement, the US led the UN to combat, making the UN of use and also setting an example that aggression will not be tolerated.

Another reason was that South Korea was located in a strategic place. South Korea has a geopolitical advantage being near the newly communist China and the USSR with a sea by its side as well. This could provide useful for the US later if needed as South Korea is under US influence.

## How did the Korean War impact the development of the Cold War?
success -> contained -> t*he US might get involved in future ones too as this one succeeded.*
not so successful -> $60 billion in spending, got fought back -> *proved China and communists had it in them to resist capitalists.* -> Korea still divided and lots of lives were lost

*The US had to accept that North Korea remains communist -> limits of the policy* -> not worth keep attacking


*SEATO* was formed, South East Asia Treaty Organization
*CENTO* was formed, Central Treaty Organization: Middle East and Central Asia (?)
US gave advice and money

1955: *Warsaw* Pact - USSR and East European Countries except Yugoslavia

![[image-5.png]]




- The Korean War had several positive and negative consequences for the USA    

|**Positive consequences**|**Negative consequences**|
|---|---|
|The peace treaty **kept Korea divided**. The USA had ‘protected’ South Korea from Communism. This was a success for containment|**North Korea remained Communist** and formed closer ties to China. This shows that following containment could stop but not push back Communism|
|The UN stood up against North Korea’s aggressive actions. This made **the UN more successful than the** **League of Nations** had been before the Second World War|The Korean War caused **four million** **casualties** **and the deaths of 50,000 US soldiers**. The USA had underestimated the impact of fighting against Communism|
||The USA created **anti-Communist****alliances** in Southeast Asia (SEATO) and Central Asia (CENTO). The USSR felt surrounded by enemies|
||**Tensions** **increased between the USA and the USSR**. Both began a nuclear**arms race**, creating **hydrogen bombs**and **ICBMs**. This threatened world peace|
![[image-6.png]]


**Describe the consequences of the Korean War**

The Korean War showed the world that the USA was serious about following containment (1). The USA began to create anti-Communist alliances in Southeast Asia (SEATO) and Central Asia (CENTO) (1). The USSR felt surrounded by enemies, increasing Cold War tensions between the USA and the USSR (1). However, North Korea remained Communist, showing the limitations of the policy of containment (1).

- # [[02_areas/HISTORY/05Containment/Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban Missile Crisis 1962]]
# How did the US react to revolution in Cuba?

### Background
![[image-10.png]]
In 1898, Americans helped Cubans become independent from Spain's colonial rule.

US built large naval base at Guantanamo and invested heavily in Cuban industry.
They also started controlling stakes, forcing relations, finances

1934, aided Batista to dictator -> because he was not communist
Batista became a symbol for Cubans of US control


Cuba is located near the US, southern, 100km away, very close.

Fidel Castrol
1959, after a 3 year campaign, he overthrew Batista
- knocked down or out opponents
- propaganda, charming, clever, ruthless
- communist/socialist

![[image-11.png]]

US response:
Cut investment
CIA investigate how to overthrow - 1960 June
reduce trade
support exiles, damage plantations, US companies no work with Cuban businesses
media broadcasted propaganda

Cuban exiles and US business owners whose businesses were taken: pressured US to fight back

Castro allowed US to keep naval base.

Soviet Union $100 million in aid, Cuba received advanced arms too, US spies knew this.
Cuba became powerful in Latin America

1961 January, new US president, John F. Kennedy. Eisenhower was planning on invading Cuba with the CIA, did not want a satellite state in US sphere of influence so close.
JFK approved plan, but reduced it.
Training began April 1960.


### Bay of Pigs 1961/4
1400 anti-Castro exiles supported and supplied  by the US and trained by the CIA

They failed. -> they thought Cuban people will see and help rebel, but no
Met with 20,000 Cuban troops
Within days, they were outnumbered and outgunned.

This was a half-hearted operation
- showed the USA's hand
- not wanting to directly involve
- suggested that JFFK was weak, stupid.
Strengthened Castro's positions
- Suspicious of US policy

Kennedy's half-hearted, weak operation failed swiftly. Suggesting to the world that with a few months in office, Kennedy did something stupid and weak. Leading to $100 million of USSR aid to Cuba and the strengthening Castro's positions. Makes US look bad because they also bombed civilians and Cuba received aid, so communism was not the evil one here.
    
##### Reasons why the Bay of Pigs Invasion Failed

|**The weakness of the CIA and the invasion force**|**The strength of Castro's government**|
|---|---|
|The CIA had given the Cuban exiles**limited military training**. They were unlikely to win against Castro's army due to their battle experience|**Castro knew about the invasion** before it began. Castro assembled an **army of 20,000 soldiers** to attack the Cuban exiles when they landed on the island|
|In an attempt to distance themselves from the invasion, the US government**refused to send military support** to the Cuban exiles|**Cuban** **citizens** **were happy with Castro's government**. The invasion gained limited support in Cuba|


## Missiles?
the thirteen days
the world became the closest it had ever been to nuclear war

14th October 1962.
U2 spy plane spotted 36 missiles in St. Christobol.
Can reach Washington in 10 minutes.

Italy, Turkey, England has US missiles close to Soviet's sphere -> why can't Khrushchev put missiles in their allied country of Cuba?

### How did Kennedy respond to the Cuban Missile Crisis?
By July 1962, Cuba was the best-equipped in Latin America.

Missiles, boats, tanks, radar vans, jets, bombers -> took 5000 Soviet technicians to maintain.

US believed that they won't supply nuclear arms, because their other satellite states did not, and too risky.
they were wrong.

suspicions.
September 11, Kennedy warned USSR that he would by any means neccessary prevent Cuba from being an offensive military base. This was an indirect way of saying no nukes should be put there. The USSR assured them they won't.

October 14th 1962
U2 spy plane spots definite USSR-built nuclear sites
not camouflaged though

### Crisis
![[image-13.png]]
![[image-12.png]]


---
Khrushchev was more responsible for saving the world from nuclear war because
- he tries to communicate
- removes both sides' close missiles
- no public gain from USA's removal
- loses his job

Kennedy was
- not listening to attack from other government people.
- although not attacking is logical, he showed restrain



Kennedy was responsible for close call to Nuclear war:
- logical for USSR to support their ally
- defend airspace from spy planes
- literally bargain, both sides obviously don't want nuclear fallout

- should have responded with proposal but did all that to act tough and strong (it is his job though and in the end he did it and made the US look good)


---

## Why did the Soviet Union place nuclear missiles on Cuba?

no camouflaged sites
missile supplies travelled open deck.
Khrushchev knew this would cause crisis.

ranked.
1. To test the USA
	- Bay of Pigs stuff showed stuff
2. Bargain
	- remove USA missiles
	- he sent personal letters + revisions
3. Close the missile gap
	- USA will less likely launch first, Cuba is too close
	- USSR have missiles pointed at them too
4. Defend Cuba
	- the first country that was willingly communist
	- in USA backyard
	- "hedgehog in Uncle Sam's pants"
5. Strengthen his position
	- they have nuclear power
I think it is to bargain with the USA, as both sides, and mostly Khrushchev proved that he did not want to attack, won't launch missiles at each other, because of mutually assured destruction.

This allows Khrushchev to get the USA to remove their missiles pointing at the USSR, and avoids nuclear war less. Most of the other points are side benefits if the bargain does not work.

Kennedy will probably not allow that close so it is to bargain.

## Outcomes
- ==Kennedy== improved reputation - "stood up"
- resisted hardliners in US gov.
- removed missiles secretly
- but backyard communist state

- ==Khrushchev== peacemaker, first move forwards towards compromise
- Cuba safe
- withdraw missiles
- USA criticised, ex in Britain
- but lost job in 1964 and USSR publicly forced to back down

- ==Cold war==
- led to treaties: 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
- thaw the ice in cold war

- ==Cuba==
- supported by USSR
- still communist
- gets old US stuff there
- Castro remains in charge

# Practice Questions
1. Why did the relationship between the USA and Cuba sour between 1959 and 1962
(b) Fidel Castro communism campaign in Cuba
Bay of Pigs half-hearted invasion
Shot U2 plane
Backyard missiles for USSR

2. Why did the Soviet Union place missiles on Cuba?
(b) Bargain
Cuba defended
close gap, if no bargain, gain
test Kennedy, Bay of Pigs showed he was 'weak'

3. "Kennedy handled the Cuban Missile Crisis more effectively than Khrushchev." How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.
NO
Kennedy calmed public - his job but could've started withdrawing both sides as it was clearly a bargain
Restrained from counterattack after U2 plane shot down - again logical choice but fended off other people in gov

Kennedy good but Khrushchev better.

Khrushchev began communicating
negotiate, say can do private, compromised
