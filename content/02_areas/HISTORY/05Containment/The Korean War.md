Domino Effect - coined by Eisenhower -> Policy of Containment
If one falls to communism, more will follow
Area of concern right now is Asia.

## Background
### North
- Kim Il Sung: trained in USSR
- *After WWII: freed by Soviets*
- *communist*

### South
- Syngman Rhee
- *After WWII: freed by USA*
- *divided but anti-communist,  not very democratic but enough for US support*
- *Geo location -> Yellow Sea -> also close to China -> advantageous*

## Key Events
**1910**: Japanese *colonized*
**1945**: split between *38th parallel*

![[image-4.png]]

General Douglas MacArthur
- commander of UN forces
- 95,000 SK, 300,000 USA, 44,000 other

135,000 NK, 250,000 China


**1950-1953**: Under USA, the UN went to war for the first time.
Harsh terrain
Rapid advances and retreats
later on there were trenches, similar to war of attrition in WWI



**June - September 1950** *1950/6 - 1950/9*
*Kim Il Sung* trained in USSR
*Syngman Rhee* and South was anti-communist, not very democratic but enough for US support

Both wanted *Reunification*
but that did not seem likely

*North Korean People's Army* started the hostility -> overwhelmed the south
*By 1950/9, all except a small corner of South-east Korea was taken.* Around *Pusan*

**1950/9-1950/10**
The USA wanted *containment*
Truman sent advisors, supplies, and warships to seas around Korea.
Truman needs support or else *military action looks bad.*
*So he approached the UN Security Council*

The US was the biggest UN budget contributor
the UN condemned North Korea and wanted them to withdraw
The North invaded, the UN therefore *identified them as the aggressors*
*USSR was boycotting the UN* because of China representatives issues in UN
Therefore the *USSR could not veto the UN taking action in Korea.*

So, Resolution 84 passed -> *UN armies are sent out under General MacArthur*

They *pushed communists out, but continued*, despite *warnings from China.*
*US forced reached the Yalu River by October*, beside the border of China.
Truman and MacArthur saw change of removing communism entirely from Korea.

**1950/11 - 1951/4**
The *'People's Volunteers'*: 200,000 troops from *China joined the North* Koreans, *supplied* with modern equipment from the *USSR*.

*Conditions now: cold, snow, jagged terrain*
These conditions were similar to China and good for guerrilla tactics, but not good and hard for the US.

*1951/1*: the South and US were *pushed back beyond the 38th parallel.* 
*1951/4*: *MacArthur is sacked* -> wanted to invade China and use nuclear weapons -> Truman disagrees: saving South was enough.
MacArthur was replaced with *Omar Bradley.*

**1951/6**
*Peace talks started*
Because of *Stalemate around 38th parallel*
*but fighting continued*

**1952**
New US president: *Eisenhower*
wants to stop the war, as per containment
**1953/3**
*Stalin death*
Chinese and North Koreans *less confident*


**1953/7**
*Armistice*
still back to *38th parallel*

---
## Outcomes
Deaths and Wounded: 1.3 million
3 million civilian casualties in total, millions of refugees too
North 520,000
USA: 142,000 casualties + *12 to 60 billion in defense spending,* and did not liberate entire Korea
China: 900,000 casualties + *increased American protection for Taiwan*
UN: 17,000 casualties

## Why was the US involved?
*geopolitical advantage*
*domino effect - China already turned also*
*containment*
*set an example -> using UN and UN will militarily intervened if aggressive*

| Domino Theory        | The USA wanted to stop Korea from falling to Communism. They believed that if Korea fell, **Japan would be next**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Trade with Japan     | Japan was an **important market for US** **exports**. The USA wanted to protect Japan’s **capitalism**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Truman Doctrine      | In **1947**, Truman declared that the USA would **protect any country in threat of a Communist uprising**. The US public put pressure on the government to protect South Korea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Distrust of the USSR | The USA **blamed the USSR** for North Korea’s actions. The USSR  had acted aggressively in [Eastern Europe](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/history/cie/18/revision-notes/the-20th-century-international-relations-from-1919/who-was-to-blame-for-the-cold-war/how-had-the-ussr-gained-control-of-eastern-europe-by-1948/) and [blockaded Berlin](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/history/cie/18/revision-notes/the-20th-century-international-relations-from-1919/who-was-to-blame-for-the-cold-war/consequences-of-the-berlin-blockade/) |
| Belief in victory    | The US government believed that **China would not react if they sent troops to Korea**. They hoped that they could persuade the **UN** **to provide military support** to South Korea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |


##### **Part B Practice**
**Why did the US intervene in the War?**
The US mainly intervened to stop communism from spreading because they believed in the Domino Theory. The Domino Theory states that if one country falls in Asia, other will follow. So, they do not want South Korea to fall to prevent other countries from falling into communism next, as per the containment policy.

Another reason the US intervened was to activate the United Nations. It is seen as North Koreans were the unprovoked aggressors, and to stop the mistakes the LON previously did of appeasement, the US led the UN to combat, making the UN of use and also setting an example that aggression will not be tolerated.

Another reason was that South Korea was located in a strategic place. South Korea has a geopolitical advantage being near the newly communist China and the USSR with a sea by its side as well. This could provide useful for the US later if needed as South Korea is under US influence.

## How did the Korean War impact the development of the Cold War?
success -> contained -> t*he US might get involved in future ones too as this one succeeded.*
not so successful -> $60 billion in spending, got fought back -> *proved China and communists had it in them to resist capitalists.* -> Korea still divided and lots of lives were lost

*The US had to accept that North Korea remains communist -> limits of the policy* -> not worth keep attacking


Proved that this containment costed too much, they need more alliances

*SEATO* was formed, South East Asia Treaty Organization
*CENTO* was formed, Central Treaty Organization: Middle East and Central Asia (?)
US gave advice and money

1955: *Warsaw* Pact - USSR and East European Countries except Yugoslavia






- The Korean War had several positive and negative consequences for the USA    

|**Positive consequences**|**Negative consequences**|
|---|---|
|The peace treaty **kept Korea divided**. The USA had ‘protected’ South Korea from Communism. This was a success for containment|**North Korea remained Communist** and formed closer ties to China. This shows that following containment could stop but not push back Communism|
|The UN stood up against North Korea’s aggressive actions. This made **the UN more successful than the** **League of Nations** had been before the Second World War|The Korean War caused **four million** **casualties** **and the deaths of 50,000 US soldiers**. The USA had underestimated the impact of fighting against Communism|
||The USA created **anti-Communist****alliances** in Southeast Asia (SEATO) and Central Asia (CENTO). The USSR felt surrounded by enemies|
||**Tensions** **increased between the USA and the USSR**. Both began a nuclear**arms race**, creating **hydrogen bombs**and **ICBMs**. This threatened world peace|

**Describe the consequences of the Korean War**

The Korean War showed the world that the USA was serious about following containment (1). The USA began to create anti-Communist alliances in Southeast Asia (SEATO) and Central Asia (CENTO) (1). The USSR felt surrounded by enemies, increasing Cold War tensions between the USA and the USSR (1). However, North Korea remained Communist, showing the limitations of the policy of containment (1).
