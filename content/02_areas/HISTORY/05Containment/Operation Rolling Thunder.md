# Why did the USA intervene in Vietname?
North Vietnam - communist
leader: Ho Chi Minh
Respected, kind, not a tyrant

South Vietnam - anti-communist
leader: Ngo Dinh Diem
Dictator, unpopular, evil, bad, nepotism, corrupt, knows he is the only alternative for USA, at least he was capable and had control
was later assassinated by military coup -> the US funded other anti-communist leaders

On the left, North Vietnam is represented by Ho Chi Minh, labeled as "respected" and "known as 'Uncle Ho'," and is backed by the Soviet Union (flag shown). On the right, South Vietnam is represented by Ngo Dinh Diem, who is labeled as "unpopular," "corrupt, he rigged elections," and "Catholic, he persecuted Buddhists." Diem is backed by the United States (flag shown).

> Examiner Tips and Tricks
>Students often need clarification on the **divisions of Vietnam and** [Korea](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/history/cie/18/revision-notes/the-20th-century-international-relations-from-1919/did-the-united-states-contain-the-spread-of-communism/the-usa-and-events-in-korea-1950-53/). There are many similarities. For example, the **North of each country was Communist** and the division occurred as the result of war. However, the **Allies divided Korea on the 38th Parallel** while the Geneva Agreement split **Vietnam on the 17th**. Also, the split in Vietnam was **temporary** while the division of Korea was more permanent.

|**Reason**|**Why did this cause US intervention in Vietnam?**|
|---|---|
|**Domino Theory**|Eisenhower and his **Secretary of State** **John Dulles** feared that Ho Chi Minh would win the election. This would make Vietnam Communist. They believed that if **Vietnam turned Communist, other countries in Southeast Asia would fall too**|
|**Containment**|Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson all believed in containment. They justified their actions in Vietnam as part of **their mission to stop the spread of Communism**|
|**Distrust** of the **USSR** and China|The USA **blamed the USSR and China** for North Vietnam’s attempt to spread Communism|
|**Raw materials**|Vietnam had a wealth of useful raw materials like **tungsten**, **tin and rubber**. If the USA could make Vietnam **capitalist**, it could access these raw materials|


## The Development of War in Vietnam

- In **1957**, the **Viet Minh began attacking South Vietnam**
    
    - The Viet Minh established the **Ho Chi Minh Trail** to transport weapons to the South
        
- In **1959, Ho Chi Minh declared a full-scale war** against the **Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)**
    
    - He stated his intention to overthrow Diem’s government
        
- **Many South Vietnamese supported the actions of North Vietnam**
    
    - In **1960**, Ho Chi Minh created the **National Liberation Front** (or the **Vietcong**) 
        
        - Its members included Communists from North Vietnam and peasants from South Vietnam
            
        - In reaction, **President Kennedy sent more aid to support Diem’s government**
            
- Diem’s government became more unpopular
    
    - Diem introduced the **Strategic** **Hamlets** **programme in 1962**
        
        - It aimed to create **villages protected from the Viet Cong’s influence**
            
        - In reality, it **destroyed people’s homes** and forced them to move. This gained support for the Viet Cong
            
    - He treated his people poorly by:
        
        - **Discriminating against Buddhists**, the largest faith group in South Vietnam
            
        - Taking land from peasants to give to rich landlords
            
        - Running a **corrupt** **government** and giving key positions to his family members
            
- The USA could no longer support Diem’s government
    
    - **Kennedy cut off aid to Diem**

## Vietcong Tactics

|**Tactic**|**Explanation of tactic**|
|---|---|
|**Guerrilla warfare**|The Viet Cong knew that the **US would win in open warfare**. Instead, the Viet Cong:<br><br>- Set **traps**<br>    <br>- **Ambushed** soldiers<br>    <br>- Used Vietnam’s forests to **attack and hide**<br>    <br>- Dug **tunnels**<br>    <br><br>The USA struggled to fight against these tactics|
|Use of civilians|Many **South Vietnamese citizens helped the Viet Cong**. They attacked South Vietnamese government officials. The **Viet Cong did not wear a military uniform**. As a result, US soldiers struggled to identify troops from civilians|
|Ho Chi Minh Trail|The North Vietnamese used the Ho Chi Minh Trail to **transport supplies**. Despite **constant US bombing**, supplies continued to move southwards on this route|

![A map showing the Ho Chi Minh Trail during the Vietnam War. The map displays North Vietnam (in red), South Vietnam (in blue), Laos, Cambodia, and parts of neighboring countries. Red arrows represent the Ho Chi Minh Trail—a supply route used by North Vietnam to transport troops and supplies into South Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia. Several arrows point toward key cities and regions in South Vietnam, including Hue, Kontum, Pleiku, Buon Brieng, Bu Prang, and Saigon. Blue dots mark U.S. Special Forces camps throughout South Vietnam. The 17th Parallel, which divided North and South Vietnam, is also labeled. The map includes key geographical features such as the Gulf of Tonkin, South China Sea, and Gulf of Thailand.](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/02/ho-chi-minh-trail-map.png)

##  US Tactics

|**Tactic**|**Explanation of tactic**|
|---|---|
|Bombing|The US undertook **large-scale bombing campaigns** on North Vietnam’s capital city, **Hanoi, key military bases and the Ho Chi Minh Trail**. During the war, the USA dropped **three million tonnes of bombs**|
|**Chemical warfare**|The USA had a huge **technological advantage** over the North Vietnamese. They used **chemicals like** **Napalm** and **Agent Orange**. The aim was to **destroy the dense forest** that the Viet Cong hid in. This type of warfare caused high civilian **casualties**|
|**Conscription**|From **1967, the US government introduced** **conscription** (or ‘the draft’). A large proportion of the US Army were **young and Black Americans**. Most of these soldiers had no choice but to fight in Vietnam. This meant that the US soldiers had **low** **morale** and wanted to return to the USA|
|**Search and Destroy**|The US sent troops in helicopters to **find and attack Viet Cong bases**. This method caused many deaths. **Viet Cong traps killed US soldiers**. US troops **attacked innocent villagers** in the belief they were Viet Cong. Search and Destroy pushed many Vietnamese to support the Viet Cong|

## Why Did Public Opinion Turn Against the Vietnam War?

- The US public turned against the Vietnam War because:
    
    - **Conscription was unpopular**
        
        - Around 2.8 million US soldiers fought in Vietnam
            
        - The draft affected black Americans disproportionately
            
        - The police prosecuted over **9,000 young men for ‘****draft dodging****’** 
            
    - The **Tet Offensive (1968)** caused the media to **question if the war was worthwhile**
        
    - It was the **first televised war**
        
        - The US public saw **photographs and news reports** of the Vietnam War in graphic detail
            
        - **Scandals like the My Lai** **Massacre** were uncovered, changing the public’s perception of the US Army
            
- **Anti-war protests peaked 1968-70**
    
    - Students were the key opposition group to the war
        
        - In **November 1969, 700,000 anti-war protesters** marched in Washington
            
        - In **May 1970, the** **National Guard** shot dead four student protestors at **Kent State University**
            
        - The media coverage of the shootings caused **2 million students in 400 schools to go on strike**

## The Consequences of the End of the Vietnam War

- **President Nixon won the 1968 presidential election** on the promise to end the Vietnam War
    
    - Nixon and his **National Security Adviser**, **Henry Kissinger**, wanted to pull out of the war with dignity
        
- After the **unsuccessful bombing campaigns of Laos and Cambodia**, Nixon began the process of US withdrawal
    
    - In **January 1973**, the **US and the North Vietnamese** government signed the **Paris Peace Accords**
        
        - This **officially ended US involvement** in Vietnam
            
        - Nixon declared the US withdrawal was ‘**peace with honour**’
            
    - By 1973, only 30,000 US troops remained in Vietnam
        
        - **The conflict between North and South Vietnam continued**
            
    - On **30th April 1975**, the South Vietnamese capital, **Saigon, fell to North Vietnamese forces**
        

|**Positive consequences**|**Negative consequences**|
|---|---|
|The US public was **happy to see the end of the ‘unwinnable war’**|Containment had **failed militarily**. While the USA had stronger weapons, the communist **Viet Cong had better tactics**|
||Containment had **failed politically**. By **1975, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia became Communist**. The USSR and China, who had given money and technology to North Vietnam, had gained new Communist **allies**|
||Containment had **failed in the** **propaganda** **war**. The use of chemical warfare and disregard for Vietnamese civilians **ruined the USA’s international reputation**. Over 58,000 US soldiers died with millions of Vietnamese casualties|
||Containment had **failed economically**. The Vietnam War **cost the USA around $168 billion**|

- As a result, the **US government abandoned the policy of containment**
    
    - Nixon pursued **détente** with the USSR and China
