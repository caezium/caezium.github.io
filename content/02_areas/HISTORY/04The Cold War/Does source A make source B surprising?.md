Source A and B disagree over the reasons the USSR decided not to accept Marshall Aid. Source A explains that Molotov left the conference on Marshall Aid as he did not want to give up the Soviet’s economic data to the US and that ‘Stalin had not yet decided on a split with the USA. Whereas, source B explains that Stalin clearly rejected the Marshall plan ‘as a trick by Truman… to infiltrate Europe’ Showing a clear split between the USA and the USSR as decided by Stalin as he saw the plan as hostile.
Although the sources disagree, source A does not make source B surprising because Source A was from a British history textbook in the 1980’s which was during the Cold War and little was known about Soviet policy during the implementation of the Marshall Plan. On the other hand, Source B was from a former employee of the Soviet foreign ministry in 1947, speaking recently, Yerofeyev would have intimate detailed knowledge of Stalins thoughts on Marshall Aid and was speaking after the Cold War had ended.

Source A does not make source B surprising.
Source A and source B disagree over whether Stalin decided to continue trusting the USA, his attitude towards them. Source A explains that because Molotov left the Marshall aid meeting refusing to supply the economic data, so Stalin had not yet decided if they would want to 'split with the USA'. Whereas source B explains that Stalin was always suspicious and clearly rejected the plan as a 'trick by Truman' and was doing the aid just to infiltrate European countries.
Although the sources disagree, this is not surprising because Source A is from a British history book in the 1980s, not containing any quotes or references, so it is the comprehension of the writer or editors of the book, meaning that they must not have all the details. Source B is a recent interview with a Soviet Foreign Ministry worker in 1947, so they must have clear and concise knowledge of what happened. The interview was also conducted after the Cold War so he can share his internal insights.

Source A and B disagree over the aims of US foreign policy. Truman in source A explains that US foreign policy aims to support freedom and democracy by opposing soviet control. This is shown in the quote ‘I believe that is must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation’. Source B on the other hand explains that Truman's policy is a ‘smokescreen’ for ‘expansion’. Izevestia compares the US rhetoric to Nazi comments about the USSR, and claims the US is trying to take control of Greece and Turkey. 

Although the sources disagree over the aims of US foreign policy, source A does not make source B surprising. Source A is a speech by President Truman in which he is defending his foreign policy actions and will therefore glorify the position on the United States and demonize the Soviet Union. Source B on the other hand is a Soviet newspaper. In 1947, Stalin was in the process of cementing control over Eastern Europe, and Trumans’ policies could potentially act as an obstacle to the further spread of communism. It is therefore unsurprising that the Izvesti denounced US policy.

Overall, although sources A and B disagree, source A does not make source B surprising.
