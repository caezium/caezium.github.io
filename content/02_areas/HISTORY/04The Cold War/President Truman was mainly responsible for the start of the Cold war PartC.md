Truman may be partly responsible for the start of the Cold War because of his aggressive anti-communist stance and attitude towards the USSR. Truman had a very aggressive containment policy towards the Soviets including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and Bizonia, all are provocatively designed to isolate and contain the USSR. Truman also did not tell the USSR about their atomic bomb, and chose to reveal it in the Potsdam meeting. Thinking that they can control and dictate the meeting because of their atomic dominance. These aggressive acts provokes the USSR and their ideology. The concealment and use of the atomic bomb does not give the USSR any reason to continue their alliance or trust the West.

Truman was partly responsible for the start of the Cold War because of the introduction and implementation of Marshall Aid. Marshall Aid was money given out for free to economically damaged countries post World War 2, so that countries can redevelop faster without a volatile economy. Marshall Aid in total handed out $13.3 billion, the US said that they provided this aid to prevent the European economy from totally collapsing. However, its true purpose can be said was to create American influence within those struggling countries that rely on the US, therefore the US can also have markets in those countries and influence those countries decisions. They wanted the preservation of a capitalistic economy and to further their ideological agenda that was portrayed as an act of philanthropy and charity. This made the USSR worry about America using 'dollar imperialism' to expand into western Europe, which massively increased tensions between the two countries and ideology.

However, another big contributor of the start of the Cold War can also be the USSR leaving the Red Army in Eastern European countries and using terror to install forced communist governments. Stalin set up the Cominform, banned opposition, and killed opponents to impose communist regimes. The act of forcefully making communist satellite countries and not holding fair, free elections broke the Yalta agreement and was a clear sign that Stalin wanted to undermine capitalism. The US saw this as Stalin wanted to dominate the entirety of Eastern Europe and later the whole of Europe while forcing them under the Soviet Communists' wing, making the US worry what was going on behind 'the iron curtain' and what aggressive expansionist act Stalin will do next.

Furthermore, Stalin further shares the responsibility for the Cold War because he imposed the Berlin Blockade as an deliberate attempt to drive the three powers out of west Berlin and gain total control of eastern Germany. The Berlin Blockade was designed to block all supplies from going into west Berlin so that the people there will eventually have to seek Soviet help, forcing out western influence. This was an obvious and clear act of defying the agreements and control another part of eastern Europe, creating problems for the west and tension, as the wrong response from the west can lead to war.

Overall, Truman was partially at blame for the Cold War because of his aggressive stance and implementation of a plan that furthers the US's influence throughout Europe, but the blame can be shared with Stalin's equally or more aggressive acts and betrayal against agreements.
