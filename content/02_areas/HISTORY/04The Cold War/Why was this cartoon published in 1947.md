In source C, we see onion shaped churches throw out a lasso around Czechoslovakia. The onion buildings represent Moscow, and the lasso means their control over Czechoslovakia. The big message in the cartoon is that Moscow has a loose control around Czechoslovakia right now, but they can tighten and grip Czechoslovakia when they want to. The title of the cartoon is "when the time is right", suggesting that they will inevitably turn Czechoslovakia into a communist state under the Cominform.
The cartoon is for Americans and published in 1947. The purpose of the cartoon is to influence the American viewers to dislike the USSR because of their salami tactics and urge people to persuade Congress to take immediate action. The cartoon wants to change the American people's minds of the threat of the expansion of Soviet influence is immediate. This cartoon was published in 1947 because at the time Czechoslovakia was not considered to be eastern-Europe and they were about to be taken over by Soviets, so Congress was deciding whether to provide aid or not and whether they will still follow the policy of isolationism, and they needed to gain America support.

In the source, we see a figure riding a cow, the Marshall plan, from Wall Street to Europe. The figure is a member of the American government and he is being watched by the members of the British and French government. The cow is being milked at Wall Street. The message this shows is that the USA is using the Marshall plan to have more influence over Europe and later will milk Europe dry, generating them money and France and Britain does not oppose this as they want Marshall aid. Marshall aid is money provided to countries that want it and the US will create markets in those countries for them to later trade with, so at the end, the US will end up with more markets to deal in and gain financially instead of this aid being totally charity.
The cartoon was published in Eastern Europe in 1947 to influence people to see the Marshall plan as an act of US expansion and them wanting more domination over Europe and not because they totally want to help. Â This is seen in the cartoon where there is a safe behind the cow being milked, highlighting that any financial benefits will go to the US only and not the British and French governments shown, who's land seems to be getting devoured by the cow. The cartoon wants people to reject the Marshall plan as in 1947 the US is starting negotiations and introducing Marshall aid to countries.
