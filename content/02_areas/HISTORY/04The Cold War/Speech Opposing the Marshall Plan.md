The Marshall Plan should not be launched, it is an economic aid for lands far far away, while the intentions behind this plan may sound noble and just, I come before you to voice my opposition.

The core of this plan, is money. We will be giving away 17 billion dollars, that is 7% of our GDP, given for free. This venture costs us hugely but has no guarantees of success. And who will pay for it? We will pay, us taxpayers. Every one of us has to pay at least 120 dollars more tax dollars, roughly 15% of your family's income.

Our national debt is also starting to pile up. We had 43 billion dollars in debt pre war, and now, it has increased to 252 billion dollars just 8 years later. That is a 500% increase! Do we have to address it and fix i t now? Proponents say no, they want to leave this problem for rich billionaires that later on that rise from our capitalistic society, and hope they can fix it while managing their own media platform, several companies and 13 children without a conflict of interest to reverse what could be tens of trillions of debt decades later. Should the average American worker be beaten to dig deeper into their own wallets to subsidize for others instead of fixing our own government and ideology?

Moreover, involving ourselves deeply into the affairs of other nations has no good outcome. We do not want to be involved in any conflict that is halfway across the world from us. 
This plan is said to be a safeguard against communism, but could it backfire? People have already began distrusting our motives, seeing this plan as more of an attempt at domination.

If you truly believe in democracy, you will believe that the strength of democracy is not how much money we give, but is the example we set and in the pure and perfect ideology itself. 
I urge everyone to reject the Marshall Plan and do what capitalism does best, prioritize ourselves and focus on our own growth.
