Bloody Sunday caused the 1905 Revolution because it destroyed the people's trust in the Tsar. On January 22 1905, peaceful protestors were fire upon by troops, killing hundreds. This made the already discontent Russians angry. The Tsar, who was their 'Little Father' as per the Orthodox Churches teachings, had allowed the peaceful marchers to be killed. This turned citizens loyalty into anger and distrust, leading to strikes and protests all across Russia.

Furthermore, Bloody Sunday united different groups of people in opposition for protesting. They united groups of workers, peasants, and students , who all joined in the mass demonstrations after the massacre together. This made it a nationwide movement with around 200,000 people marching together, showcasing the widespread discontent and desire for change, causing the 1905 Revolution because it  created a nationwide unity against the Tsar.

However, a further cause of the 1905 Revolution was the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Russia's humiliating defeats showed the government's weaknesses. Russia being a large country could not even defeat a small country like Japanese. To add salt to injury, not only did they lose, the war also created food shortages and economic hardship for the citizens at home. This caused the Revolution because it increased anger at the Tsar's incompetence and made people more willing to protest as the discontent had been long term and this was another further short term trigger.

Another problem that lead to the 1905 Revolution was the economic problems. The long term poor economic conditions made living conditions unbearable and painful. Russia in 1905 was still a poor agricultural Empire with the rest of the world already gone by then. They had only 4% of the population as urban workers, and more than half peasants. Wages were low, production was low, and efficiency was also low. These economic conditions led people to be frustrated with the Tsar's planning for the Russian Economy, slowing feeding people's discontent towards the Tsar.

Overall, Bloody Sunday was the spark that triggered the revolution. However, it was only successful in causing revolution because of the long-term problems of land hunger, economic hardship, and the failures of the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, Bloody Sunday was responsible but not to a large extent.

How far were the events of Bloody Sunday responsible for the revolution of 1905? 

Bloody Sunday was the spark that ignited the people of Russia into revolution in 1905, however the economic problems Russia faced were the root cause of discontent with The Tsar.  Therefore Bloody Sunday was responsible to a small extent because if it had not happened another trigger would have caused The Revolution. 

Bloody Sunday was responsible for the events of 1905 because the march of peasants and workers demanding reform was unprecedented in Russia.  On the 22nd January 1905, 200,000 civilians marched on the Winter palace, demanding changes to the Tsar’s economic and foreign policies.  A demonstration this large proved how unhappy the Russian people were with the current autocratic system, in a country where opposition to The Tsar was illegal.  This initial mobilization of the Russian people set a precedent which allowed further mobilization to continue throughout the year. 

Bloody Sunday was also responsible for the events of 1905 because the Tsar’s response to the march on The Winter Palace turned the Russian people against his rule.  The workers petition organised by Father Gapon although demanding improved living and working conditions such as an 8 hour working day, actually supported the continued rule of the Tsar.  However after the army fired on the peaceful marching civilians by orders from The Tsar, it changed the public’s perception of their monarch.  The once peaceful protesters turned violent and stopped asking for reform and called instead for revolution.  The changed perception of Government were taken advantage of by Political Parties such as the Social Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks who organised Soviets and co-ordinate the workers’ political activity, which presented a real challenge to The Tsar’s Autocratic rule during 1905. 

Although Bloody Sunday was the spark of the Revolution, there were deeper causes.  The poor economic conditions was what drove the workers of St Petersburg out to petition The Tsar in January 1905.  Russia in 1905 was still a poor agricultural Empire with only 4% of the population working in Industry.  Government reforms under the finance minister Witte between 1890 and 1903 had encouraged Russia to have a ‘Great Spurt’ in it’s economic growth with industrial output booming, but by 1903 the economy had fallen into recession.  The recent arrivals in St Petersburg who had come looking for work, could find none and consequently fell into poverty.  It was these economic conditions that had led people to be disgruntled with The Tsar’s handling of the Economy and to petition The Tsar, leading to Bloody Sunday and the events of 1905.  This was therefore a greater cause than Bloody Sunday itself. 

The Russo- Japanese war further heightened the economic difficulties Russia was facing in 1905 causing greater opposition to The Tsar.  The decision to go to war, ironically, was initially taken by The Tsar to gain support from the people of Russia and distract them from the tough economic circumstances The Empire was facing.  However The War had the opposite effect; Russia was decisively defeated by the Japanese, with its Baltic fleet totally wiped out by the superior Japanese navy, the first time in History an Asian power had defeated a European rival.  The War was not only humiliating for Nicholas II, but worsened the conditions for Russians, as food was diverted away from cities such as St Petersburg, forcing bread prices to rise, heightening discontent in a population already suffering economic hardships.  The lack of faith in the Tsars decisions and worsening conditions in the major cities led to the Revolution of 1905. 

Bloody Sunday was the spark that ignited the people of Russia into revolution in 1905, however the Economic problems Russia faced were the root cause of the discontent.  Therefore Bloody Sunday was responsible to a small extent because if it had not happened another trigger would have caused The Revolution.
