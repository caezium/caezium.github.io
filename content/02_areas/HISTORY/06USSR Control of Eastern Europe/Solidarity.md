Why did Polish workers form Solidarity?
Polish workers were angry that party members enjoyed more benefits than they did for example better medical treatment
- living standards
- prices
- not really about overthrowing the communist government
- inefficient state-controlled economy
- growing foreign debt
- the Catholic Church urged them to
- trade unions were banned
- killed strikers



Why did the Government allow solidarity to grow?
- they were strong -> Union were in the 
most important industries, shipbuilding and heavy industry -> strike = would devastate the economy
- high support, organization, devout Catholics
- almost half of all workers belonged in the union, 9.4 million people by January 1981
- international scrutiny ->  the West gained notice of Solidarity
- distracted by other stuff -> Soviet-Afghan War
- economic pressure
- hoping for Solidarity to fight within itself
- Violent suppression can backfire politically -> deepen hatred, cannot stop unrest in the long run


Why was Solidarity crushed?
- Solidarity started to act as an alternate political party to the communist party -> Moscow claimed to have secret tapes of a Solidarity meeting setting up a new provisional government without the communist party
- Rationing had been introduced
- Wage increases did not follow inflation rates
- unemployment rising

- fear of total economic collapse with the threat of a General Strike
- The Brezhnev Doctrine
- Warsaw Pact countries pressure
