### Background
Czechoslovakia was influenced after WW2 because
it was touching with the USSR border
- buffer zone to the west
- industry
- raw materials

the Sudetenland was also a very strategic area for defense as it had mountains and hills and fortifications were easy.

Novotny was the leader

1945 - coalition government
1946 - communisms won free, fair election, but still coalition, only the communist party was the largest in the gov
1948 - Jen Msaryk assassinated by the USSR, pushed off. Soviets banned other political parties. Gained control


StB - State Security - secret police
Dubcek and Husak as later leaders

### Main Causes
- workers work gets scrapped -> bad system -> inefficient -> meaningless work -> officials and managers were "party men", might not know how to plan the planned economy
- rigged trials -> did not like how Communists won Czechoslovakia over -> discontent + political repression
- they wanted to test Brezhnev for reforms, as he was the new Soviet leader.

- **In 1968, the Czech Communist Party elected Alexander Dubcek** as First Secretary
    
    - This title gave Dubcek the responsibility of leading the Czech government
        
    - The **USSR approved the appointment** of Dubcek
        
- Dubcek was a **devout** Communist. He believed in:
    
    - The **upholding of the Warsaw Pact**
        
    - '**Socialism** **with a human face**’. People in a communist state should be able to:
        
        - Express their opinion about communism
            
        - Raise concerns about their government without facing punishment
            
        - Gain access to a better quality of life
            
- In **April 1968**, the Czech government released a **series of reforms**. This period of reform is known as the **Prague Spring**
    
    - Prague was the capital of Czechoslovakia
        
    - A 'spring' refers to a period of new beginnings and political reform

## Brezhnev's Reaction to the Prague Spring

- **Brezhnev demanded that Dubcek reverse the Prague Spring reforms**
    
    - **Dubcek ignored his request**
        
    - Dubcek invited **Ceausescu and Tito**, the leaders of Romania and Yugoslavia, for talks
        
        - This appeared to be an aggressive action against the USSR 
            
        - Brezhnev could not allow Czechoslovakia to **unify** with non-Soviet Communist states
            
- Brezhnev believed that he needed to **take urgent action against Dubcek** and the Prague Spring reforms

    - **Husak remained loyal** to the USSR
