Source surprising?

Does Source A make source B surprising? Explain your answer using the sources and your own knowledge. (8)

Source A does not make Source B surprising because they are from people who opposed and despised each other.

Source A and Source B disagree over how much support the Hungarian Uprising had. Source A claims that the Hungarian Uprising the the new reformist leader was 'popular' only because Imre Nagy used 'deceit and intimidation to draw people into mutiny" and there were a "small number of supporters". While Source B states that the 'people in Hungary were absolutely against the Stalinist elements still in power'. The two sources disagree over the support of Hungarians for reform, showing the clear difference of the dissidents and decadents wants to view the situation in.

This disagreement of events and Hungarian views is not surprising because Source A was from Khrushchev's, the Soviet leader at that time, personal memoirs of events and Source B was from the President of Yugoslavia who previously disobeyed the Cominform. Khrushchev, being a communist man, will definitely steer towards justifying his actions and suppression of the Hungarian Uprising that caused 4000 people to die. President Tito will show a more clear perspective from opponents of the USSR of how they feel about Soviet control.

Although the sources disagree, due to the provenance and context, Source A does not make Source B surprising.

Example Part C Questions:


"‘The Soviet Union’s desire for security was the main reason for its control over Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1989.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer."


Focus: Motivations.
What to consider: Security (buffer zone), ideology (spread of communism), economic benefits, fear of Western influence. You'd need to weigh these against each other.



"To what extent was Soviet military force the most important factor in maintaining control over Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1981 (before Gorbachev)?"


Focus: Methods of control and their effectiveness.
What to consider: Military interventions (Hungary '56, Czechoslovakia '68), presence of Red Army, economic ties (Comecon), political control (Cominform, loyal local leaders), propaganda, secret police, versus the underlying desire for independence in satellite states.



"Which event was a more serious challenge to Soviet authority in Eastern Europe: the Hungarian Uprising (1956) or the Prague Spring (1968)? Explain your answer."


Focus: Comparing opposition movements.
What to consider: Aims of the reformers/rebels, nature of the challenge (armed revolt vs. internal reform), Soviet response, immediate and longer-term consequences for Soviet control and for the respective countries.



"‘The Berlin Wall was a symbol of Cold War division but ultimately a failure for the Soviet Union.’ How far do you agree with this statement?"


Focus: Significance and consequences of the Berlin Wall.
What to consider: Short-term "successes" (stopping refugee flow, stabilizing GDR economy), long-term propaganda disaster, symbol of oppression, its eventual fall as a symbol of Soviet collapse.



"How important was the Solidarity movement in Poland in the eventual collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe?"


Focus: Role of a specific opposition movement in the broader decline.
What to consider: Solidarity's initial successes, its suppression, its survival underground, its role in inspiring other movements, how it demonstrated the limits of Soviet power, alongside other factors like economic problems, Gorbachev's reforms, etc.



"‘Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies were the main reason for the collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe by 1989.’ How far do you agree with this statement?"


Focus: Factors leading to the collapse, with emphasis on Gorbachev.
What to consider: Glasnost, Perestroika, Sinatra Doctrine, ending of Brezhnev Doctrine, versus long-term economic weaknesses in the USSR and satellite states, nationalist sentiments, the impact of earlier resistance (Solidarity, Charter 77), Western pressure.


"Assess the consequences of Soviet control for the people of Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1989. In your answer, consider both positive and negative impacts."


Focus: Impact on daily life, society, and economy.
What to consider: Negative: lack of freedom, repression, economic shortages, environmental damage, suppression of national identity. Positive (from a Soviet perspective or limited actual benefits): stability (enforced), industrialization (though often inefficient), education/literacy improvements in some areas, social welfare (though often basic). The question asks for an assessment, so a judgment on the overall balance is needed.



"To what extent did economic factors drive both the USSR’s desire to control Eastern Europe and the opposition to that control?"


Focus: The role of economics as a motivator and a source of discontent.
What to consider: USSR's motivations: resources, markets, Comecon integration, reparations (early on). Opposition: economic hardship, shortages, desire for better living standards, resentment at resources being diverted to the USSR, strikes (e.g., Poland).



"‘Opposition to Soviet control in Eastern Europe was consistently met with overwhelming force and was therefore entirely unsuccessful until the late 1980s.’ How far do you agree with this statement?"


Focus: Effectiveness and nature of opposition over time.
What to consider: Examples of force (Hungary '56, Czechoslovakia '68, martial law in Poland). Were there any successes, however small or temporary, before the late 1980s? (e.g., Gomulka's reforms in Poland '56, Kadar's "goulash communism" in Hungary after '56, the very existence and survival of Solidarity). The "entirely unsuccessful" part is key to challenge.



"Compare and contrast the reasons for Soviet intervention in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968). Which intervention posed a greater threat to the unity of the Soviet bloc?"


Focus: Comparing specific crises and their implications.
What to consider: Hungary: Nagy's reforms (multi-party system, Warsaw Pact withdrawal). Czechoslovakia: Dubcek's "socialism with a human face" (less radical initially but feared contagion). Threat to unity: Hungary's explicit Warsaw Pact withdrawal vs. Czechoslovakia's potential to inspire wider reform movements within the bloc.



"Explain why the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 was a turning point in the Cold War in Europe."


Focus: Significance of a specific event as a turning point.
What to consider: What changed after the Wall? Stabilized East Germany (short-term), ended the Berlin Crisis (for a while), became a potent symbol of division, solidified the Iron Curtain, shifted Cold War focus to other areas (e.g., Cuba).



"‘The decline of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was inevitable by the early 1980s, even before Gorbachev came to power.’ How far do you agree with this statement?"


Focus: Inevitability and timing of the decline.
What to consider: Long-term factors: economic stagnation in USSR and Eastern Bloc, rising nationalism, appeal of the West, impact of Helsinki Accords, ongoing dissent (Solidarity, Charter 77). Argue whether these factors alone would have led to collapse without Gorbachev's specific policies.



"To what extent was the collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe a result of internal pressures within the satellite states, rather than changes within the Soviet Union itself?"


Focus: Internal vs. External factors for the collapse.
What to consider: Internal pressures: desire for national sovereignty, economic dissatisfaction, popular protests, role of dissident groups, religious influence (e.g., Catholic Church in Poland). Changes in USSR: Gorbachev's reforms, economic weakness of USSR, willingness to let go. You need to weigh these.
