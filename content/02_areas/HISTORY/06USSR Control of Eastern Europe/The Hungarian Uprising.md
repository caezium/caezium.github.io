### Background
1945 - free elections but communists only won 17%
Hungary under communist control from 1947 -> election was rigged, killed some political opposition, imprisonment

Hungary particularly important to the buffer zone because it touches the Soviet border + Czechoslovakia's
They are good at growing grains (for bread) and potatoes, food in general -> USSR needs food

Thousands of soldiers in the Red Army forced the government to accept communists in posts.
The Red Army was paid by the Hungarians

Interior Minister + Rakosi - Deputy PM = communists

Rakosi lead from 1949 - 1956 - elections - but the elections only had one party.

The secret police was called AVO

Russian was taught in schools
street signs were changed to Russian

Hungary prized their history.
### Causes
- living standards were declining -> 3 months of wages for one winter coat -> because of Soviet control over economy
- obvious propaganda
- spending money on arms, not the people, no factories were built -> poor planning, different interests
- no free speech, eg no wearing Western stuff
- AVO
- Poland success -> influenced
When the masses are unhappy, when living standards are unlivable, and when other countries have been successful, it leads to social unrest and an uprising.
## Khrushchev's Reaction to the Uprising

![A flow diagram explaining Khrushchev's reaction and punishment of the Hungarian Uprising. The flowchart states "Khrushchev sent an invasion force of 1,00 tanks to Hungary on 4th November 1956. Nagy and his supporters fought the invasion force. This is called the Hungarian uprising. Nagy contacted the West, begging them to send military assistance to Hungary. The Soviet invasion force brutally attacked the Hungarians. Historians estimate that the invasion force killed 30,000 Hungarians. This ended the uprising. Khrishchev established a stronger communist government in Hungary under the leadership of Janos Kadar. Nagy and members of his government sought refuge in the Yugoslav embassy. Kadar promised Nagy's safety. When Nagy left the embassy, Soviet spies kidnapped him. In July 1958, the Soviet government announced that Nagy had been executed.
