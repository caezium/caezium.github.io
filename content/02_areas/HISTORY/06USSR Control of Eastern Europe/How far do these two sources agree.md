Source A and Source B agree mostly but disagree on how serious the threat of direct Soviet military intervention was.

Source A states that 'an invasion was never seriously considered', while Source B says that the border military exercises were plans for Warsaw Pact intervention eventually but Kania 'managed to persuade them to call off the intervention'. Source A implies that the Soviets are hesitant and have not fully committed to intervention, Source B indicates that the Soviets were more actively considering intervention.

Source A and Source B also disagree on why Jaruzelski replaced Kania. Source A says that Jaruzelski replaced Kania because Kania was criticizing the leadership and they wanted him 'to deal with the protests more decisively', while Source B says that Jaruzelski replaced Kania 'to deal with the protests more forcefully'. Source A also implies that martial law was introduced independently by Jaruzelski, while Source B implies that Jaruzelski was appointed to deal with the crisis more forcefully and sought for moral support. Moreover, Source A tells us that Jaruzelski complained about the lack of support from the Warsaw members, while Source B says that the Warsaw states were ready and happy to support Jaruzelski. Both sources agree that Jaruzelski introduced martial law, had a meeting with the Warsaw Pact members, and that Jaruzelski claims his aim of martial law was to prevent a Soviet military intervention.

The sources mostly agree with each other, agreeing on the main events but disagreeing on the details and motives.
