Appeasement is the policy of giving in to demands to avoid a war, and we are doing exactly that. We want to avoid a war.

Because of the Great Depression, we, Britain, are not in shape for a war. We can go to war, but then we will have to win it or her empire will totally collapse. Our arms are behind from Germany's secret rearming, I have already advocated and ordered for faster rearming. Because of the Great Depression, the USA also turned to isolationism, they will not help us if all hell breaks out. With Germany being allies with Japan, our colonies might also be threatened. So if we want a war, we are basically alone, without sufficient arms, and can collapse if we lose.


After the first world war, our good citizens of the Great British Empire also sympathizes Germany because of the harsh terms on the Treaty of Versailles. There is also war trauma and a lot of people are not ready for another war nor will they want Germany to not be able to break some of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. Winston Churchill said "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last." But we are not going to get eaten. To see how the crocodile always eats the food viciously is to remind everyone to get accustomed to the notion that there will be a war. And you have to be ready for it. If we suddenly declare war on Germany right now, there will be public out lash and chaos. By feeding the crocodile, we can slowly see its aims and everyone can see how the crocodile acts. Then, people will be ready for when the crocodile tries to eat them and unite together to fight back.

Appeasement is the policy of giving in to reasonable demands to avoid war, and right now, it is the most prudent course of action. We do this not out of fear, but to secure peace while we prepare for the future.

Britain is not ready for another war. The Great Depression has weakened our economy, and we cannot yet match Germany’s rapid rearmament. Though I have already ordered faster rearming, our military still lags behind. The United States has embraced isolationism, and without their support, a conflict would leave us dangerously exposed. Germany’s alliance with Japan also poses a threat to our colonies, stretching our defenses even thinner. To declare war now, with insufficient arms and few allies, risks collapse—not just of Britain but of our entire Empire.

We must also acknowledge the mood of the nation. After the devastation of the Great War, our people are wary of another conflict. Many even sympathize with Germany, believing the Treaty of Versailles imposed overly harsh conditions. This is not the time to force the public into a war they do not yet support.

Some, like Mr. Churchill, have said, “An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.” But I believe this analogy oversimplifies the reality. Appeasement is not about feeding the crocodile indefinitely; it is about buying time to understand its movements, to arm ourselves, and to prepare the nation for the challenges ahead.

The policy of appeasement allows us to see Germany’s intentions clearly. It gives us the opportunity to strengthen our defenses and to rally the people for when conflict becomes unavoidable. If and when the crocodile turns to attack, Britain will be united, armed, and ready to fight back.
