Brief Description of Event
Contribution to WW2
Why Appeased
## 1933
Countries were still in an **economic depression**
**Hitler became chancellor.**
- **began secretly rearming**
- **took Germany out of the LON**
- **Hitler's foreign policies**
	- *To abolish the TOV*
	- *Lebensraum*
	- *Unite German speakers*
	- *Defeat communism*
**Manchurian Crisis**
- showed **inefficiency** of LON because of organization
- **ineffectiveness** of LON because of membership
- **Hitler and Mussolini took notice** on how aggression was 'permitted'

Hitler's policies laid the groundwork for expansionist actions and aggressive nationalism undermining post-WWI peace.
The failure of the LON to respond to the Manchurian crisis emboldened aggressive powers like Germany and Italy.

The Manchurian Crisis was appeased because it was too far away, and Britain and France lacked the resources and political will to stop it. Nations were focused on recovering from the Great Depression and avoiding war. Britain and France also lacked the resources and political will to confront Hitler about his policies.

## 1934
**Failure of the Disarmament conference**
- Germany did not get treated equally, Hitler **secretly rearmed** and everyone didn't disarm.
**Attempt** to take over Austria by Hitler
- **Mussolini prevented**
- showed what Hitler wanted to do

The Failure of the Disarmament conference allowed Germany to continue rearming secretly.
It was appeased because countries were not ready to disarm or enforce rules because of the Great Depression.

## 1935
**Hitler openly staged a massive military rally**
- celebrating German armed forces
- national pride and gained support
**Anglo-German naval pact**
- Britain and Germany
- in treaty Germany still thought as inferior
- **Britain citizens sympathize Germany because of the TOV**
- France angry, but could do nothing
**The Saar Plebiscite**
- propaganda worked and around 90% voted for the Saar to return to German rule
- massive **morale boost**
- TOV

## 1936
**Abyssinian Crisis**
- **LON was not willing at all to use collective force to provide collective security**
- shows more the policy of **appeasement**
Conscription in Germany
**Remilitarization of the Rhineland**
- sent under-geared troops into Rhineland to defy the TOV without any retaliation
- starts to work towards his foreign policy and gain confidence
- **appeasement**
**Germany anticommunist alliance with Japan**

The open rearmament challenged the TOV and showed Hitler's confidence and growing boldness. The Saar's return gave Hitler a big morale boost.
It was appeased because Britain sympathized with Germany's grievances over the TOV France, though angry, lacked the means to act alone.

## 1937
**Spanish Civil War**
- Germany and Italy **tested** out new weapons and tactics
- Germany made anticommunist alliance with Italy - **Rome-Berlin Axis**

This strengthened Germany's military strength for future wars and solidified cooperation between fascist powers.
It was appeased because Spain was seen as a domestic issue, not worth international conflict.


## 1938
**Anschluss**
- took over Austria
- defied the TOV, united some German Speakers
**Sudetenland**
- defied the TOV, united some German speakers
- **supreme example of appeasement** from Britain and France
- Because the Munich Agreement left out USSR in the discussions, USSR thought Britain and France were powerless to stop Hitler. So the agreement they signed earlier to help defend USSR, will be useless.

Anschluss and Sudetenland gave Germany resources, manpower, and strategic positioning.
The Munich Agreement undermined unity against Hitler and alienated the USSR.
Britain and France hoped to avoid war by conceding to Hitler's demands.

## 1939
**Czechoslovakia**
- invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia
- **Appeasement**
- Britain and France said **they will declare war if he invades Poland**
- Hitler **thought** Britain and France **will keep appeasing**
**Nazi-Soviet Act**
- **non-aggression pact** between Germany and USSR
- agreed to **divide Poland together**
**Poland**
- invaded Poland

The two invasions proved Hitler's expansionist aims were unlimited. The Nazi-Soviet Pact made sure that Germany own't have to fight a two-front war.
Britain and France delayed confrontation to prepare for war and because they misjudged Hitler's ambitions.
