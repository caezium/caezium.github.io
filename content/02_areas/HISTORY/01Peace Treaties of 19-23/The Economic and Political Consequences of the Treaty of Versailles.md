The economic consequences of the TOV were important to Germany because they lost major production lands. From the clauses in the TOV, Germany had to lose the Saar, a coalfield, for 15 years, Alsace Loraine, Upper Silesia and more. Each piece of territory had resources and pre-built infrastructure on it. Losing them decreased Germany's resources and production capabilities, in vital areas such as iron, timber and coal. This meant that not only did they lose wealth, they were also set back because they lost the facilities to produce and grow, which massively affects their ability to heal from the damages of the war.

Germany also suffered a huge amount of reparations in money, leading to hyperinflation. Germany had always been causing territorial trouble to France and was seen as the war starter, so they had to pay a huge amount of €6,600 million. This amount was not only not reasonable but also not achievable as Germany was also recovering from the war, how could they possibly get that amount of money to spare? Germany still kind of wanted to fulfill this clause but they couldn't, and it led to hyperinflation. The inflation was so bad that a piece of bread could have bought a house. This hyperinflation made all citizens suffer because their savings are useless as prices have gone way up. If there weren’t a huge reparation, this economic consequence might not have caused millions to suffer.

However, the TOV also brought political chaos as a consequence. In clause 231, Germany had to admit all guilt and blame for starting the war, and they were forced to sign it. This caused millions of Germans to rage because in their mind, it was the Kaiser who caused this and they shouldn’t have to suffer because of the Kaiser’s decisions. So, people began revolts and Putschs that led to political violence and even killed a German foreign minister. This made Germany divided and into chaos when it was already a time of despair.

Moreover, one of the Putschs was led by Adolf Hitler, the TOV sowed the seed for revenge and anger into him and millions of others, ultimately leading to the Nazi party. Because of the overly harsh clauses and war guilt in the TOV< people were angered, which made extremists who promised they would rebuild Germany and destroy the TOV popular. One of them was Hitler, who used the TOV’s harness to do speeches and campaigns, calling the drafters the ‘November Criminals’ and gained support and power in Germany, forming the Nazi party. This consequence made Germany be by a far right extremist and someone who wanted revenge and not for the country to re-develop and gain peace, which also contributed to World War 2.

In conclusion, there were big economic and political consequences of the TOV, in my opinion, I massively disagree that the economic consequences were more important for Germany than the political consequences because, in hindsight, the political consequences contributed to the start of World War 2 and the reparations were lifted a lot over the years it was introduced,

"German Hatred of the TOV was justified” How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer. 

German hatred of the reparation clauses of the Treaty of Versaille was justified because it was way too harsh. Germany had to give up 16% of their coal fields along with half of its iron and steel Industry, this struck German pride and also limited their production. The most harsh term on the treaty was the £6,600 million they had to this was over loo billion gold racks! We cannot forget that Germany was also in the war and also suffered from losses, they had to recover too. But this gargantuan amount of a fine depletes and diverts the majority of their resources, hindering recovery massively. This was also supported and foreseen by British Economist Keynes in his book "The Economic consequences of the Peace" and, in 1923, we see total hyperinflation, where the money that could have bought a house could barely buy a loaf of bread. This huge reparation destabilized their economy and recovery and the hatred was totally justified. 

Furthermore, German citizens hated the fact that they had to take the guilt and were forced to sign the treaty. The world war was caused by many factors and yet it was all blamed on Germany. Even after the Kaiser was overthrown, they were to blame and citizens were not happy that the Kaiser's war was theirs to take blame for. Because of "them starting the war”, Germany was also not invited to draft or discuss treaty terms and was forced to sign. This led to widespread discontent and lots of political conflicts, such as Putsches. The amount of conflict and public discontent he war guilt clause led to was also a justification of their hatred.

However, one could say that the hatred against the whole ‘harsh' treaty was not justified at all because of how Germany treated Russia. Germany’s Brest-Litovsk treaty to Russia was way harsher than the Treaty of Versailles and they should not complain when they treated others so badly.

Additionally, some Germans hated that their territories got taken away and the German-speaking people got separated. This wasn't justified because Austria-Hungary lost two thirds of their land and Germany also took Alsace Lorraine before in the Treaty of Frankfurt. As per their industrial and coal regions, again, their Treaty of Brest Litvosk was way harsher (taking 89% of Russia's coal fields), and they shouldn't complain. Germany was still an independent country and not split up, unlike the French's wishes, so they shouldn't hate the territorial charges that much. 

To wrap it all up, German hatred of the Treaty of Versailles was mostly justified because it led to political instability and hyperinflation. But it wasn't totally justified because they treated Russia more badly and they were left as an independent state.
