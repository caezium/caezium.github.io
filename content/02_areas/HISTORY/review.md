'The British policy of appeasement seemed reasonable at the time.' How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer. One reason why appeasement seemed reasonable at the time was because many in Britain saw the Soviet Union as a greater threat than Nazi Germany. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the spread of communism had caused widespread fear across Europe. The British political elite were especially alarmed by the idea of communist revolution spreading westwards. The USSR’s hostility to capitalism and past attempts to encourage worldwide revolution contributed to its reputation as an unpredictable and dangerous power. In contrast, Hitler was seen by some as a buffer against Soviet expansion, particularly as he was outspoken in his anti-communist views. To many British policymakers, it made sense to allow Germany to grow in strength as a means of containing Stalin’s influence in Eastern Europe. This perspective made concessions to Hitler appear pragmatic rather than reckless, especially since Britain did not want to be dragged into a conflict that might benefit the USSR.

Another reason why appeasement appeared reasonable was that it gave Britain more time to rearm. After the First World War, Britain had significantly reduced its military spending, and public opinion was strongly against entering another war. By the early 1930s, the British armed forces were not prepared for a major conflict. The policy of appeasement, particularly under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, was seen as a way to delay war while British defences were rebuilt. For example, the Royal Air Force was in the process of modernising its fighter planes, and radar systems were still being developed. The extra time gained through negotiations with Germany, such as the Munich Agreement of 1938, was used to strengthen the country’s military capabilities. From this perspective, appeasement was a temporary but necessary policy while Britain prepared for the possibility of a future war.

However, appeasement was also unreasonable because it encouraged Hitler to become more aggressive and confident. By continually giving in to his demands—such as allowing German rearmament in 1935, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, and the Anschluss with Austria in 1938—Britain and France sent the message that they were unwilling to confront Nazi expansion. This emboldened Hitler to push further, culminating in the occupation of the Sudetenland and eventually the whole of Czechoslovakia. Each success without consequences increased Hitler’s confidence in his ability to achieve his goals through intimidation and force. In effect, appeasement allowed Germany to grow militarily and strategically stronger, making the eventual war more difficult for Britain and its allies. It also undermined the credibility of Britain’s commitment to defend smaller nations, which would later prove critical when Germany invaded Poland in 1939.

Appeasement was also unreasonable because it alienated the Soviet Union, especially after the Munich Conference in 1938. At Munich, Britain and France agreed to allow Hitler to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia without consulting the Soviet Union, despite it being an ally of Czechoslovakia. This exclusion demonstrated to Stalin that the Western powers were not interested in a united front against Germany and were even willing to sacrifice smaller states to avoid war. As a result, the USSR became increasingly distrustful of Britain and France, contributing to its decision to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact in 1939. This non-aggression agreement between Germany and the USSR shocked the world and allowed Hitler to invade Poland without fear of a two-front war. Had Britain worked more closely with the Soviet Union instead of appeasing Hitler, it is possible that a stronger alliance could have deterred German aggression.

In conclusion, while appeasement may have seemed reasonable to many at the time—especially given the fear of communism and the desire to avoid war while rearming—it ultimately had serious negative consequences. It strengthened Hitler, undermined collective security, and pushed the USSR towards a pact with Nazi Germany. Therefore, although there were reasons for the policy, its long-term impact suggests that it was ultimately an unreasonable and dangerous approach.

‘How different was the reaction of the USSR to the uprisings in Hungary and Czechoslovakia?’ Explain your answer.

One key similarity in the Soviet response to both Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 was the use of military force to suppress reform. In both cases, the USSR sent troops to maintain control over its Eastern European satellite states and to prevent any weakening of the Warsaw Pact. In Hungary, Soviet forces invaded after Prime Minister Imre Nagy attempted to introduce multi-party democracy and declared the country’s intention to leave the Warsaw Pact. In Czechoslovakia, Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops entered the country in response to Dubček’s liberalising reforms during the Prague Spring. These actions demonstrated the Brezhnev Doctrine in practice: no Warsaw Pact country would be allowed to turn away from socialism or Soviet influence.

However, the level of violence used by the USSR was very different in the two cases. In Hungary, the Soviet response was swift and brutal. Around 3,000 people were killed during the invasion and subsequent fighting, and over 200,000 fled the country. Nagy was later executed. The violence was designed to crush resistance and send a clear warning to other states. In contrast, the invasion of Czechoslovakia saw less bloodshed. Though tanks rolled into Prague and there were protests, most resistance was non-violent, and casualties were much lower—around 70–100 people were killed. The contrast shows that while both interventions relied on force, the Hungarian uprising was met with far more severe violence and repression.

Another similarity is that in both cases, the USSR initially tolerated some reforms—as long as they didn’t threaten Soviet control or the dominance of the Communist Party. In Hungary, Nagy’s early proposals focused on reforming the economy and improving political freedoms within a socialist framework. Similarly, Dubček’s Prague Spring reforms included greater press freedom, more local economic decision-making, and a more open political climate—termed “socialism with a human face.” Both leaders began their reforms without initially seeking to abandon communism altogether, and for a short time, the USSR allowed these changes to proceed.

Nevertheless, there were differences in how far reforms were ultimately tolerated. In Hungary, when Nagy pushed too far by legalising other political parties and announcing Hungary’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, the USSR responded with overwhelming force. The reforms were completely reversed, and a hardline regime under Kádár was imposed. In Czechoslovakia, although Dubček was removed from power, the rollback of reforms was more gradual. Some of his policies remained in place for a time under Gustáv Husák, and the transition back to stricter control—known as “normalisation”—was less violent and more controlled. This suggests a more flexible and strategic Soviet approach in 1968 compared to the rigid and punitive response in 1956.

In conclusion, the Soviet response to both uprisings was similar in its core aim: to maintain control over the Eastern Bloc through military intervention and to limit reform. However, key differences lie in the extent of violence used and how far reforms were tolerated or reversed. While both cases reflected Soviet intolerance of deviation from its model of socialism, the harsher, more violent response in Hungary marked it as more extreme than the reaction in Czechoslovakia.

3. Source Question The cartoon was published to persuade the British to oppose the harshest terms put forward by the French at

the Paris peace conference. The cartoonists message is that the Paris Peace conference is dominated by France who are aiming to strip bare the German Nation and use it’s resources for French benefit, by imposing terms that are completely unreasonable. This is shown in the source where Clemenceau, is represented as a chef with the title of ‘Peace conference’ pinned to him, is plucking the German imperial Eagle in the French Foreign ministry, as though it were a chicken in a kitchen. The feathers that have been plucked represent the terms of the treaty, imposing harsh military restrictions, leaving the Eagle naked, humiliated, and lifeless ready for the cooking pot, and eventually to be consumed and by France. This represents the reality of the Paris peace conference in which the French leadership wanted to punish Germany severely for the damage The War had inflicted upon France, with the Prime Minister Ponticare even proposing to dismantle the German state entirely. The purpose of the publication in March 1919 in Britain, three months before the Treaty of Versailles was finalized, was to persuade the British that the French demands were unreasonable, and to encourage them to oppose the harshest most unreasonable terms suggested by France.
