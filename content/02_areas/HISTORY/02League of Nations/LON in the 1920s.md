The [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON|LON]] **was successful** in some ways in the 1920s, **stopping small wars and improving lives.**
However, it **failed** to get **disarmament**, and persuade more **powerful countries to stop fighting.**

The failure of disarmament was especially **damaging** to the [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON|LON]]'s reputation because **Germany had disarmed but no other countries followed to the same degree**. Many countries were not willing to be the first to disarm.



- When a country has a friendly foreign policy, international diplomacy is good
- When a country has an **aggressive foreign policy**, they do not want to make compromises, which affects diplomacy
- During the 1920s, international diplomacy was good
- However, countries **made agreements outside of the League’s influence**. This was because:
    - Important nations like the **USA, the** **USSR** **and Germany** [were not members](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/history/cie/18/revision-notes/the-20th-century-international-relations-from-1919/to-what-extent-was-the-league-of-nations-a-success/weaknesses-of-the-league-of-nations/)
    - The League was **slow at making decisions**


### How Did International Diplomacy Impact the League of Nations?

[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The Rapallo Treaty|The Rapallo Treaty]]
[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The Locarno Treaty|The Locarno Treaty]]
[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The Dawes Plan|The Dawes Plan]]
[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The Young Plan|The Young Plan]]

- The League **encouraged other countries** to pursue better international relations
    - The number of treaties agreed upon shows a **positive political environment** in the 1920s
- Even in the 1920s, League members were **bypassing** **[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The Assembly|The Assembly]] and Council**
    - The League of Nations discussed issues but rarely developed solutions
- League members entered the above treaties independently, not as representatives of the League
    - Wilson intended the League to lead the way in international agreements. Instead, it gained a reputation of **words over actions**
    - During the 1920s, countries began to **ignore the League** and pursue their own foreign policies



## **Land disputes**
### ==*Vilna, 1920*== (Poland and Lithuania) **FAILURE**
![[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/attachments/LON in the 1920s-20241103200228000.png|505]]
- **It undermined the League’s power**
    - It was the first time that an invaded country requested the help of the League
    - The League did not fulfil its pledge for collective security
- It showed the **reluctance of the permanent members to raise an army**
    - France did not want to upset Poland
        - They saw Poland as a potential **ally**
    - Britain did not want to act without the support of other members

### ==*Aaland Islands, 1920–1921*== (Finland and Sweden) **SUCCESS**
![[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/attachments/LON in the 1920s-20241103200325346.png|500]]
- One of the **biggest successes** of the League of Nations
- If both members respected the League of Nations, they:
    - Would ask the League for help in their dispute
    - **Accept the League’s decision**
- *and they did!*

### ==*Upper Silesia, 1921*== (Germany and Poland)
![[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/attachments/LON in the 1920s-20241103200453413.png|608]]
- Initially, the Upper Silesia dispute was a success for the League
    - **Both countries accepted its ruling**
- When the League’s solution ended in 1925, relations between **Poland and Germany worsened**
    - Poland argued that half of the population of Upper Silesia was Polish yet they received only a third of the land
    - Germany stated that the agreement took away a quarter of its coal mines

### ==*Corfu, 1923*== (Greece and Italy) **FAILURE**
![[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/attachments/LON in the 1920s-20241103200731501.png|681]]
- Without the USA, the League **could not stand up to powerful countries** like Italy
    - Britain and France preferred not to get involved in the conflict
    - Mussolini had successfully bullied the League into giving him what he wanted
    - It set the standard by which **other aggressive leaders could manipulate the League**
- It demonstrated that organizations like the Conference of Ambassadors could **overturn the League’s decisions**


### ==*Bulgaria, 1925*== (Bulgaria and Greece) **SUCCESS**
![[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/attachments/LON in the 1920s-20241103200905392.png|532]]
- It showed the **inconsistencies** of the League’s rulings
    - Both the Corfu and Bulgaria disputes:
        - Involved the death of a military officer
        - Resulted in an armed invasion of a country           
    - The League **did not punish Italy** for invading Corfu, **yet punished Greece** for invading Bulgaria
- The League was desperate **not to** **antagonise** **certain countries** that could start a war
    - As a result, the League did not rule fairly in all disputes
        - This **undermined their reputation** as a peacekeeping force



## Geneva Protocol **FAILURE**
1924
Because of the **Corfu Incident, Britain drafted this protoco**l so that if there was a conflict, member countries has to follow and accept the **Council's ruling**.
Because there was a new **British conservative government. They refused to sign**, because it was *not in their interests*. So Britain proposed this to strengthen the League, but then **refused, thereby weakening them** because it shows how they **don't act in the favor of collective security.**



# **Social Conditions**
### Refugees **4/5**
- **400,000 prisoners of war were returned** to their homes only in the first few years after the war
- **Nansen passport** to make the process of returning refugees to their homes easier and quicker
- Housed hundreds of thousands when **Turkey crisis.**
*They lacked funding and after 1930 was useless because the influence of the [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON]] declined too.*
