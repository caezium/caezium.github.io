## Consequences of the Abyssinian Crisis
- The Abyssinian Crisis highlighted the **selfish interests of Britain and France**
    - The Hoare-Laval Pact aimed to give Mussolini what he wanted to **protect Britain and France’s** **imperial** **interests in East Africa**
    - Britain and France avoided taking firm action against Italy
        - They **did not close the** **Suez Canal**
            - Italy continued to have sea access to Abyssinia
    - Britain and France had just signed the **Stresa Front (1935) with Mussolini**
        - The Stresa Front was an **agreement against Nazi Germany**
            - This **alliance** seemed more important to France and Britain than protecting Abyssinia
        - Britain and France did not succeed in a long-lasting alliance with Italy
            - **In 1936, Italy and Germany formed the Rome-Berlin Axis**
- The incident reconfirmed how **weak the League was without the USA**
    - The **USA sold oil to Italy**
        - If the League placed oil **sanctions** on Italy, they feared that the USA would not support the League
        - As a result, Italy continued to have essential resources for war


October 3 1935: invades without declaration of war
October 1935: [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON]] condemns and sanctions are imposed but limited
December 1935: Partial economic sanctions, ineffective lack of commitment from major powers
March 1936: Captures Addis Adaba, [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] of Abyssinia
March 7 1936: Germany remilitarized Rhineland, unchallenged, France fears
October 25 1936: alliance - **Rome-Berlin Axis**


## How the Abyssinian Crisis ended collective security
- **Failure of collective action** - not united
	- Italy clearly violated international laws
	- the league imposed late and inefficient sanctions
- **total lack of support from big powers**
	- all focused on **personal interests**
- **No trust in [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON]] left**
- Rise of Militarism
	- failure to respond contributed to rearming because it was **thought of as ok**
*Major powers were willing to make concessions at the expense of smaller nations in order to prevent wider conflicts.*
