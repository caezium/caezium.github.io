## The World Disarmament Conference, 1932
- During the Manchuria Crisis, the League hosted the **World** **Disarmament** **Conference**
    - The event took place in Geneva, Switzerland
    - It ran from **1932 to 1934**
- The Manchuria Crisis affected the success of the conference
    - It proved the **weakness of the League** against countries with a large military force like Japan
        - This only encouraged countries to **pursue a policy of** **militarism**
- The World Disarmament Conference **ended in failure** in 1934
    - Weimar politicians challenged all countries to **disarm to the level of Germany**
        - **France disagreed** with Germany’s proposal
    - Hitler became the leader of Germany in 1933
        - He promised to **not** **rearm** **Germany if all countries destroyed their weapons in five years**
            - Hitler was already secretly rearming Germany
            - **France,** **Czechoslovakia** **and Poland feared for their safety** as they bordered Germany. They refused Hitler’s offer
            - Hitler used this as an excuse to **leave the League of Nations in November 1933**
### Why was the Failure of the World Disarmament Conference Important?
- The League was inactive
    - It took **ten years** for the League to assemble world leaders to discuss disarmament
- More countries became aggressive
    - **Japan and Germany were no longer members of the League**
    - **Militarism** and rearmament began in many countries
