## Consequences of the Manchurian Crisis
- The League of Nations looked **weak**
    - The League considered the Lytton Report in **February 1933, 18 months** after Japan had invaded Manchuria
        - This was **too slow** to react to a crisis of this scale
    - **Britain and France did not want to stand up against Japan**
        - Japan was a permanent member of the League
            - It had equal power to Britain and France to veto any actions
        - Britain and France had **colonies** **in the Far East**
            - If the League started a war with Japan, it would affect Britain and France’s imperial trade
- The League did not have key countries as members
    - The **USA** would have the **military strength** to stand up against Japan
        - In addition, the US was Japan’s key trading partner
    - The **USSR** did not want Japan to invade closer to its territory and would **use force to stop this**
- The League’s lack of reaction **encouraged further aggression**
    - **Germany and Italy** were also looking to expand their territories
    - Hitler and Mussolini knew now that **the League would not stop them** from achieving their aggressive foreign policy aims
