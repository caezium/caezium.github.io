### ==[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON brief timeline|LON brief timeline]]==
The First World War (1914-1918) was a clash of twentieth-century technology with nineteenth-century warfare tactics. Historians estimate that the conflict caused around **8.5 million military deaths and around 13 million civilian** **casualties**. The impact of **artillery**, **chemical warfare and machine guns** shocked the world. Some political leaders aimed to end warfare as a method of resolving national issues. 

**Woodrow Wilson was the US president**. On 8th January 1918, he made a speech to **Congress** called the **14 Points speech**. Within this speech, Wilson outlined his vision for post-war Europe.

The main aspect of Wilson’s 14 Points was the **creation of the League of Nations**. The aims of the League of Nations were:

On 10th January 1920, the League of Nations began its peacemaking efforts. From its onset, it **faced criticism** from Europe and the USA. European countries worried that the League would **interfere too much or be too weak**. After the First World War, **US politicians followed a policy of** **isolationism**. Despite Wilson creating the concept of the League of Nations, the **USA would never become a member**.

Despite some early success in the 1920s, the **League failed to keep world peace**. **On 1st September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland**, which triggered the beginning of the Second World War. Historians debate about the extent to which the League of Nations could have prevented the Second World War. Some historians state that the League of Nations was **doomed to fail** due to worldwide events like the **[[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/Great Depression|Great Depression]]**. Other historians argue that the League **should have done more to prevent Hitler’s aggressive** **foreign policy**. World leaders learnt from the failure of the League when creating the United Nations in 1945.
