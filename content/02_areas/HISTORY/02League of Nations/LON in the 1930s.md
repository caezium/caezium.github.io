### Why was Militarism an Issue for the League of Nations in the 1930s?
- **Militarism went against the League’s core aim of** **disarmament**
- The League would have to stop aggressive actions from countries who:
    - Threatened others using their large armed [[Forces]]
    - Invaded countries to expand empires
    - Started wars
- The League **lacked the USA’s military force**
    - **France and Britain were unwilling to spend money to stop international aggression**
        - **They were still recovering from the [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/Great Depression]]**
    - Countries knew that the **League was weak in the 1930s**
        - A strong military would scare the League to rule in the country’s favor

# [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/Manchurian Crisis]]
	Major failure of the LON
- The League of Nations looked **weak**
    - The League considered the Lytton Report in **February 1933, 18 months** after Japan had invaded Manchuria
        - This was **too slow** to react to a crisis of this scale
    - **Britain and France did not want to stand up against Japan**
        - Japan was a permanent member of the League
            - It had equal power to Britain and France to veto any actions
        - Britain and France had **colonies** **in the Far East**
            - If the League started a war with Japan, it would affect Britain and France’s imperial trade
- The League did not have key countries as members
    - The **USA** would have the **military strength** to stand up against Japan
        - In addition, the US was Japan’s key trading partner
    - The **USSR** did not want Japan to invade closer to its territory and would **use force to stop this**
- The League’s lack of reaction **encouraged further aggression**
    - **Germany and Italy** were also looking to expand their territories
    - Hitler and Mussolini knew now that **the League would not stop them** from achieving their aggressive foreign policy aims


# [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The World Disarmament Conference]]
- The League was inactive
    - It took **ten years** for the League to assemble world leaders to discuss disarmament
- More countries became aggressive
    - **Japan and Germany were no longer members of the League**
    - **Militarism** and rearmament began in many countries

- [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/The World Disarmament Conference]] **ended in failure** in 1934
    - Weimar politicians challenged all countries to **disarm to the level of Germany**
        - **France disagreed** with Germany’s proposal
    - Hitler became the leader of Germany in 1933
        - He promised to **not** **rearm** **Germany if all countries destroyed their weapons in five years**
            - Hitler was already secretly rearming Germany
            - **France,** **Czechoslovakia** **and Poland feared for their safety** as they bordered Germany. They refused Hitler’s offer
            - Hitler used this as an excuse to **leave the League of Nations in November 1933**

# [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/Abyssinia Crisis]]
## Consequences of the Abyssinian Crisis
- The Abyssinian Crisis highlighted the **selfish interests of Britain and France**
    - The Hoare-Laval Pact aimed to give Mussolini what he wanted to **protect Britain and France’s** **imperial** **interests in East Africa**
    - Britain and France avoided taking firm action against Italy
        - They **did not close the** **Suez Canal**
            - Italy continued to have sea access to Abyssinia
    - Britain and France had just signed the **Stresa Front (1935) with Mussolini**
        - The Stresa Front was an **agreement against Nazi Germany**
            - This **alliance** seemed more important to France and Britain than protecting Abyssinia
        - Britain and France did not succeed in a long-lasting alliance with Italy
            - **In 1936, Italy and Germany formed the Rome-Berlin Axis**
- The incident reconfirmed how **weak the League was without the USA**
    - The **USA sold oil to Italy**
        - If the League placed oil **sanctions** on Italy, they feared that the USA would not support the League
        - As a result, Italy continued to have essential resources for war
## How the Abyssinian Crisis ended collective security
- **Failure of collective action** - not united
	- Italy clearly violated international laws
	- the league imposed late and inefficient sanctions
- **total lack of support from big powers**
	- all focused on **personal interests**
- **No trust in [[02_areas/HISTORY/02League of Nations/LON]] left**
- Rise of Militarism
	- failure to respond contributed to rearming because it was **thought of as ok**
*Major powers were willing to make concessions at the expense of smaller nations in order to prevent wider conflicts.*
