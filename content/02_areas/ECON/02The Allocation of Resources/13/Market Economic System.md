An **economic system** describes **the way in which an economy is organized and ran**, including alternative views of *how scarce resources are allocated.*

*There are **three** main types of economic systems*
- **Market**
	-  relies on market forces of **demand and supply, in the private sector,** to allocate resources with minimal government intervention.
- **Mixed**
	- **combination** of market and planned
- **Planned**
	- owned and allocated by the **government**


## Disadvantages of the market economic system
- **income and wealth inequalities**
	- the rich have far more choice and economic freedom.
- **environmental issues**
	- resource depletion, pollution, climate change
- **social hardship**
	- the absence of government control means that public goods may not be provided, no relief of poverty, only sometimes provided by voluntary charities.
- **wasteful competition**
	- using unnecessary resources, such as extra packaging.
	- consumers might be exploited by marketing tactics
