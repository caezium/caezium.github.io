**Market Equilibrium**  
exists when the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] for a product matches the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]] so there is no excess [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]].

price-quantity graphs - an x shape always, with price on the y-axis  
The [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] curve shows that consumers will tend to buy more as the price falls.  
The [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]] curve shows that firms tend to offer more for sale as the prices increase.

- Equilibrium in a market occurs when **[[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] = [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]**
- At this point the price is called the **market clearing price**
    - This is the **price** at which sellers are clearing (selling) their stock **at an acceptable rate**

## equilibrium price
also referred to as the *market clearing price*
**where [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] and [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]] are equal at that price**
**there are no shortages or surpluses of the product**

- Any price **above or below** P creates **[[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/9/Disequilibrium]]** in this market
    - [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/9/Disequilibrium]] occurs whenever there is **excess [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]]** or **excess** **[[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]** in a market
