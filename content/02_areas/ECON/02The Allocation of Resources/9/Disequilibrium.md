**Market Disequilibrium**  
occurs when the market price is either above or below the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price.  
- If the price of a product is above the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price, the product is deemed to be too expensive for consumers, so the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded.  
with excess [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]], firms reduce price, going back to the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]]  
- if the price of the product is below the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price, the produce is deemed to be too cheap to attract sufficient [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]], so the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied.  
to create the incentive for more [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]], prices increase, going back to [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]].




## disequilibrium
all the prices where it is not at the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price
**there will be a surplus or shortage of products**

market forces will move the price towards the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]].

# Excess Demand
- **Excess demand** occurs when the demand **is greater** than the supply
    - It can occur when **prices are too low** or when **demand is so high** that supply cannot keep up with it

###### Diagram analysis
- At a price of P1, the **quantity demanded** of electric scooters (Qd) is **greater** than the **quantity supplied** (Qs)
- There is a **shortage** in the market equivalent to **Q****s****Q****d**


#### Market response
- This market is in **disequilibrium**
    - Sellers are frustrated that products are selling so quickly at a **price** that is obviously **too low**
    - Some buyers are frustrated as they will **not be able to purchase** the product
- Sellers realize they can **increase prices** and generate more **revenue** and **profits**
- Sellers gradually **raise prices**
    - This causes a **contraction in QD** as some buyers **no longer desire** the good/service at a higher price
    - This causes an **extension in QS** as other sellers are more **incentivized to supply** at higher prices
- In time, the market will have **cleared the excess demand** and arrive at a position of **equilibrium (P****e****Q****e****)**
    - Different markets take different lengths of **time to resolve disequilibrium**. For example, retail clothing can do so in a few days. Whereas the housing market may take several months, or even years

# Excess Supply
- **Excess supply** occurs when the supply **is greater** than the demand
    - It can occur when **prices are too high** or when **demand falls unexpectedly** 
- During the later stages of the pandemic the market for face masks was in **disequilibrium**

###### Diagram analysis
- At a price of P1, the **quantity supplied** of face masks (Qs) is **greater** than the **quantity demanded** (Qd)
- There is a **surplus in the market** equivalent to **Q****d****Q****s**
    

#### Market response
- This market is in **disequilibrium**
    - Sellers are frustrated that the masks are **not selling** and that the **price** is obviously **too high**
    - Some buyers are frustrated as they **want to purchase** the masks but are not willing to **pay the high price**
- Sellers will gradually lower **prices** in order to generate more **revenue**
    - This causes a **contraction in QS** as some sellers **no longer desire** to supply masks
    - This causes an **extension in QD** as buyers are **more willing** to purchase masks at **lower prices**
- In time, the market will have **cleared the excess supply** and arrive at a position of **equilibrium (P****e****Q****e****)**
