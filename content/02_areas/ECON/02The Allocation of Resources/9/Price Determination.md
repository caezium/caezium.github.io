- In a **[[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/6/Market System]]**, prices for [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]]/services are determined by the **interaction of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] and [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]** 
    - A **market** is any place that brings **buyers** **and** **sellers** together
    - Markets can be **physical** (e.g. McDonald's) or **virtual** (e.g. eBay)

    - Buyers agree the price **by purchasing** the good/service
    - If they do not agree on the price then they **do not purchase** the good/service and are exercising their **consumer sovereignty**

- Based on this interaction with buyers, **sellers** will gradually **adjust their prices** until there is an **[[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price** and **quantity** that works for both parties
    - At the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price, **sellers** will be satisfied with the **rate/quantity** of sales
    - At the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]] price, **buyers are satisfied** that the product provides benefits worth paying for

### Moving from market [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/9/Disequilibrium]] to market [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]]
**market [[Forces]] will move the price towards the [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]].** 

- if the firm sets the price **above** [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]]
	- not all products will sell, **surplus [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]**
- if the firm sets the price **below** [[what/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium]]
	- products will sell out, **shortage of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]**
