- **Revenue** is the amount of money a firm receives from selling its goods/services
    - Total revenue = price x quantity
- The **total revenue rule** states that in order to **maximize revenue**, firms should **increase** the price of products that are **inelastic** in demand and **decrease prices** on products that are **elastic** in demand 
- This can be illustrated using a demand curve


knowledge of the PED can be used to *assess the impact on consumer expenditure to get more sales revenue*

sales revenue - amount of money received by a supplier from the sale of a good or service. *= price x quantity*
this is not the same as profit.

| **price change** | *inelastic* demand | *unitary* demand | *elastic* demand |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| increase         | rise in revenue    | no change        | fall in revenue  |
| reduce           | fall in revenue    | no change        | rise in revenue  |
depends tho..

lower than 45 degrees = inelastic
higher than 45 degrees = elastic

in this pic, angle is higher than 45 so it is elastic. 
here you can see that the loss box area is smaller than the gain box area, so moving the price to p2 generates more revenue.

_**An illustration of price elastic demand where a small decrease in price from P1→P2 causes a large increase in quantity demanded from Q1→ Q2**_
###### Diagram analysis
- The demand curve is very **elastic** in this market
- When a good/service is **price elastic in demand,** there is a greater than proportional increase in the quantity demanded to a decrease in price
- **Total revenue is higher** once the price has been **decreased**

###### Diagram analysis
- The demand curve is very inelastic in this market
- When a good/service is **price inelastic in demand,** there is a smaller than proportional decrease in the quantity demanded to an increase in price
- **Total revenue is higher** once the price has been **increased**






## price discrimination
- **Knowledge of PED** is important **to firms** seeking to **maximize** their revenue**
    - If their product is **price inelastic in demand,** they should **raise their prices**
    - If **price elastic** in demand, then they should **lower their prices**
    - Firms can choose to use **price discrimination** to maximize their revenue i.e. lower prices for certain segments and higher prices for others

when firms charge different customers different prices for the same product because of differences in their PED
ex. Theme parks
adults charge higher than children
adults less demand to go to theme park but needs to go if the children wants to go.
higher prices when weekends - time


## taxes based on PED
- **Knowledge of PED** is important **to Governments** with regard to **taxation and subsidies**
    - If they **tax price inelastic in demand products**, they can raise tax revenue without harming firms too much
    - Consumers are less responsive to price changes so **firms will pass on the tax** to the consumer
    - If Governments **subsidize** price elastic in demand products, there can be a **greater than proportional increase** in demand

demerit and merit goods. not beneficial and beneficial to society.
merit goods - subsidies to raise demand
demerit - taxes to lower demand.
`inelastic demand`
consumers don't significantly change their consumption when prices rise. 
So, taxes on inelastic goods are more effective in curbing some consumption while ensuring revenue.
like demerit goods

`elastic demand`
a high tax could reduce consumption easily.
