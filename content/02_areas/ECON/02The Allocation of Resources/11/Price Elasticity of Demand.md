The law of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] states that as the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded will tend to fall.
- Economists are interested **by how much** the **quantity demanded will fall**

*remember the word **RELATIVELY***

However the responsiveness of change in the quantity demanded may vary.

ex. a rise in the price of a product with plenty of substitutes will have a larger impact on its level of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] than a price rise of a product that has few substitutes.

**PED measures the degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a product following a change in its price.**
[[Elastic]] - **relatively large change in the quantity demanded** of a product following a change in its price - *buyers are very responsive to changes in price*
inelastic - opposite

> [!theorem] 
> $$PED =\frac{Percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded}{Percentage\ change\ in\ price}$$
> **$$PED =\frac{\% \Delta QD}{\% \Delta P}$$**

^ percentage change in quantity demanded =
$$\frac{change\ in\ demand}{original\ quantity\  demanded}$$
^thus the percentage change in price is =
$$\frac{change\ in\ price}{original\ price}$$


*negative* PED -  inverse relationship, the law of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]]
The PED value will **always be negative** so economists **ignore the sign** and present the answer as the absolute value.

size of PED - this indicates the extent by which [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] will extend or contract when [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/10/Price Changes]]


**Inelastic** - $0 < |PED| < 1$
![[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/11/attachments/Price Elasticity of Demand-20241028142924403.png|366]]
**[[Elastic]]** - $|PED| > 1$ 
![[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/11/attachments/Price Elasticity of Demand-20241028142911295.png|400]]
If $|PED| = 0$ then the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] is *perfectly inelastic [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]]*
If $|PED| = \infty$ then the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] is *perfectly [[Elastic]] [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]]*
If $|PED| = 1$ then it is unit elasticity of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]], where change in price results in an equal change in quantity demanded.

## The Determinants of PED **SPLAT**
- **S - Availability of substitutes**  
	Good availability of substitutes results in a **higher value of PED** (relatively [[Elastic]])
- **P - Price of product as a proportion of income**  
	The lower the proportion of income the price represents, the **lower the PED value will be**. Consumers are less responsive to [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/10/Price Changes]] on cheap products (relatively inelastic)
- **L - Luxury or necessity**  
	Luxury [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] are more [[Elastic]] because they are not essential, while necessities are more inelastic because consumers have no choice but to buy them.
- **A - Addictiveness of the product**  
	Addictiveness turns products into necessities, resulting in a **low value of PED** (relatively inelastic)
	- **advertisement** and brand **loyalty** : habits, fashion, taste
		- inelastic - more loyal to brand
	- **costs of switching**
		- higher cost to switch = more inelastic
	- **Time**: Habits, Addictions, Fashion, Taste
		- inelastic - cant be delayed, need to use rn
		- [[Elastic]] - can buy later, not used rn
- **T - Time period**  
	In the short term, consumers are less responsive to price increases, resulting in a **low value of PED** (relatively inelastic). Over a longer period of time, consumers may feel the price increase more and will then look for substitutes, resulting in a **higher value of PED** (relatively [[Elastic]])
	- **durability**
		- more durable a product is, the more [[Elastic]] it is.


## Relationship between [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/11/PED and Total Revenue]]
knowledge of the PED can be used to *assess the impact on consumer expenditure to get more sales revenue*

sales revenue - amount of money received by a supplier from the sale of a good or service. *= price x quantity*
this is not the same as profit.

| **price change** | *inelastic* [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] | *unitary* [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] | *[[Elastic]]* [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| increase         | rise in revenue    | no change        | fall in revenue  |
| reduce           | fall in revenue    | no change        | rise in revenue  |
depends tho..

lower than 45 degrees = inelastic
higher than 45 degrees = [[Elastic]]
![[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/11/attachments/IMG_5284.jpeg]]
in this pic, angle is higher than 45 so it is [[Elastic]]. 
here you can see that the loss box area is smaller than the gain box area, so moving the price to p2 generates more revenue.


## price discrimination
when firms charge different customers different prices for the same product because of differences in their PED
ex. Theme parks
adults charge higher than children
adults less [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] to go to theme park but needs to go if the children wants to go.
higher prices when weekends - time


## taxes based on PED
demerit and merit [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]]. not beneficial and beneficial to society.
merit [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] - subsidies to raise [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]]
demerit - taxes to lower [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]].
`inelastic demand`
consumers don't significantly change their consumption when prices rise. 
So, taxes on inelastic [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] are more effective in curbing some consumption while ensuring revenue.
like demerit [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]]

`elastic demand`
a high tax could reduce consumption easily.
