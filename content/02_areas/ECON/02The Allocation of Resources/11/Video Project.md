intro

pop sound for new point that comes up and show on screen
zoom in slowly when they monologue


commonly used device: price increase
neccessity - depends on that

must buy adn moust not
necessity - phone, apple -> good features, luxury, good advertisement (people know about what they upgraded and stuff secrutyi) , less substitutes with those features, more durable now because of battery
not buy - vr headphones, headphones, both have substitutes, earphones and normal screens

apple products
seen as luxury, more and more expensive, as time goes on more substitutes at lower prices
but  not necessary


flower
luxury for gifting but not necessary for daily lifeÂ 
holidays and occasions - good time and habits to buy flowers
advertisement - not as effective to her because flowers are not really something you look for everyday
other ways of gifting stuff? - there are lots of other gifts substitutes



supply pes
electronic
price increase, supply increase?
no,  idk his first point

better and faster factors of production - more stocks - better pes
