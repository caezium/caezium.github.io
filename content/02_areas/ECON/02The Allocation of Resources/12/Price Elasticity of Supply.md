> [!def] Price Elasticity of Supply (**PES**)
> the degree of **responsiveness of quantity supplied** of a product **following a change in its price**

*Supply is said to be price elastic if producers can quite easily increase supply without a time delay if there is an increase in the price of the product.*

*Supply is said to be price inelastic if firms find it difficult to change production in a given time period due to a change in price.*

> [!theorem] 
> $$PED =\frac{Percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ supplied}{Percentage\ change\ in\ price}$$
> **$$PED =\frac{\% \Delta QS}{\% \Delta P}$$**

# Determinants of PES
**the level of stocks** - unused inventory/stocks that are available for use. doesn't have to be products, can be raw materials and components used in the production process.


- time taken to produce it: use the stocks to produce the final product
- ease and cost of altering its supply: the ease of changing the factor use makes supply highly price elastic. ex. a machine specifically designed to manufacture a single product will make supply more inelastic because it can't be switched.
- the feasibility of storing it: ability and time frame the stocks can be stored.

**the number of producers in the industry** - the more the easier it tends to be for firms to increase their output in response.
ex. plenty of restaurants so suppliers will be highly responsive to increases in price. hence the greater the number of firms in the industry, the more price elastic supply tends to be. pharmaceutical industry have few suppliers, making the supply inelastic.

**time period** - most firms are not able to change their factor inputs. ex. farming, the supply of fresh fruit and vegetables are dependent on the time it takes to harvest the products and climatic conditions. here, supply is less responsive to changes in price in the short run. supply is more likely to be price elastic in the long run because firms can adjust their levels of production according to price changes in the market.



> [!def] **Spare Capacity**
> **Unused productive resources.** When a business or economy has spare capacity, it can produce more goods or services without needing to invest in additional resources, infrastructure, or labor.  Businesses with spare capacity can respond and scale up production without significant extra costs. Having too much Spare capacity, however, can be costly if its too underutilized.









**Inelastic** - $0 < |PES| < 1$
**[[Elastic]]** - $|PES| > 1$ 
If $|PES| = 0$ *perfectly inelastic supply*

If $|PES| = \infty$ *perfectly elastic supply*

If $|PES| = 1$ then it is *unit elasticity* of supply

$<45$ degrees = elastic





## significance
it is generally good to have a high PES, being highly responsive to changes in price.
makes firms more competitive -> more revenue

 To have an elastic PES firms can:
 - inventory
 - spare capacity
 - innovation/upgrading technology
 - storage systems
 - develop and train employees to improve labor occupational mobility
