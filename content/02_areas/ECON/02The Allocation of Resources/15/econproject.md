### Bike-Sharing

**Market Failure Type**: 
As you walk along the sidewalks in Chinese cities, you can see that almost all public bike parking spaces have bike-sharing companies' bikes parked in them. Before, when bike-sharing was popular,  you can see fleets of parked bikes on public sidewalks, showing their product and service to all pedestrians walking by and luring them to use them. Later on, this became a problem, because bikes were occupying too much space on sidewalks and. caused blockages and injuries. This overuse and exploitation of public spaces for private profit in terms of customer outreach and inventory space is called **tragedy of the commons**.
The blockage and obstruction of sidewalks is also a **negative externality**. 'Pollution' on the sidewalks made the walking space too narrow, slowing and limiting foot traffic and can cause injuries.
During the height of the bike-sharing popularity, Ofo and Mobike quickly captured 80% of the market share, leading to a **monopoly**. This monopoly led to smaller companies not being able to compete. They try to compete, manufacturing and shipping out their own bikes, but don't have the same user-base or cheapness of the two monopolies, leading to their bikes not being used, leading to the bikes being thrown away. This is another **negative externality**, the waste from unused bikes is very high and damages the environment. The oversupply of 40+ dockless (No designated or designed parking docks) contributed to steel and aluminum waste, 1.5m tons. The solid tires and digital locks also makes recycling costly, 35kg of CO2 per bike.

**Evidence**: 
Oversupply of 40+ dockless companies led to waste
3,000+ bikes dumped in rivers
Solid tires and digital locks makes recycling costly (35kg of CO2 per bike).
bikes cause steel/aluminum waste (1.5M tons).
Bikes are just left on public sidewalks when no one uses them, taking up common space.

**Key Stakeholders**:
 Harmed: 
 - Pedestrians -> Trip hazards from sidewalk clutter
- Local governments -> $500/month per worker cleanup costs 
- Ecosystems -> Metal waste from non-recyclable frames.

Benefited: 
- Firms (Ofo, Mobike) -> Captured 80% market share
- Users -> 1 RMB/ride subsidies.

  

**Solution 1**: **Cap bike amount + geofenced parking**
Prevent illegal parking of bikes with geolocation services in the bikes.
Pros: 
- Reduces oversupply
- allocative efficiency via GPS tracking.
- detects bad parking, discourages users from doing so
Cons:
- High enforcement costs ($2M/year in Beijing)
- may limit accessibility in low-density areas.

  

**Solution 2**: **Pigovian tax**
Pros: 
- bike monthly taxes could fund recycling (offsetting 35kg CO2 per bike)
- Reduces negative externalities
- if they were forced to pay a tax, it could not only help offset the negative externalities but discourage the factory from oversupplying so much in the first place.
Cons:
- Pigovian taxes are difficult to calculate properly
- Imposing the wrong tax would be inefficient and costly, and discouraging the use of scooters and bike sharing programs
- Can hit low-income consumers hardest


**Responsibility**: 
We believe that the companies, like Ofo and Mobike, should be responsible because of their profit-driven overproduction. Over 40 firms flooded cities with their bikes to use the public resource of sidewalks for free advertising and outreach to customers, creating at least 95% of externality costs.

### E-Scooters

**Market Failure Type**:
The illegal and unregulated parking of e-scooters leads to safety risks and sidewalk congestion. At one point, 60% of Shanghai's sidewalks were obstructed by scooters. Some e-scooters were also left in emergency entrances in apartment complexes, blocking crucial passages. E-scooters also led to people being able to travel at high speeds, this was seen with delivery riders. Some went 32km/h vs. the 8km/h pedestrian speed on sidewalks, posing a huge safety risk. Oversupplied e-scooters also created lots of battery waste, harming the soil because of lithium leakage. These are all **negative externalities** of unregulated use of e-scooters. This unregulated use is because of **information asymmetry**, users were unaware of the correct parking rules, and there weren't designated parking spots for them to park their scooters. There might also be a. lack of bike/scooter lanes, forcing them to weave between pedestrians.

**Evidence**: 
normal users speeding or delivery riders speeding on sidewalks (32km/h vs. 8km/h pedestrian speed)
60% of Shanghai sidewalks were obstructed by scooters
lack of bike lanes in some places
E-scooters create battery waste (lithium leakage harms soil)
Scooters could pile up near apartment buildings without proper parking spaces for them, blocking everyday travel for other residents.
Scooters could be parked in stairwells or emergency access entrances, blocking off crucial entrances and pathways.

**Key Stakeholders**:
Harmed: 
Pedestrians -> Injury risks:15% increase in ER visits in Shanghai 2022
Governments -> 4M/year for scooter dump yard cleanups.

Benefited: 
Companies -> delivery companies have high revenue and users because of ease and speed
Users -> 15-minute (now longer) delivery guarantee


**Solution 1**: **AI-monitored geofenced slow zones with penalties if broken**
Pros: 
- reduces accidents 
- preserves accessibility
Cons: 
- monitoring costs
- requires good internet and cell service infrastructure

**Solution 2**: **Mandatory insurance for firms**
Pros: 
- Covers national healthcare costs from accidents
- the 'polluter' pays
Cons: 
- Could raise user fees
- complex insurance claims process


**Responsibility**: 
**Government** (70%) and **delivery companies** (30%). 
Lack of bike lanes (only 12% of Shanghai roads have them) forced scooters onto sidewalks, but delivery firms incentivized reckless riding via punitive delivery targets. Users might not be aware of parking rules or why with their driving skills they shouldn't speed, so governments should also raise awareness.

###### Conclusion
Before this project, we only saw two types of shared-bikes on the sidewalks, blue ones and yellow ones. It turns out it is this way because they dominate the market, and it is not like smaller companies didn't try to compete in this market. In fact they do, but they can't profit with these two big firms, leading to their production of bicycles go to waste. Hundred of thousands maybe even millions of wasted bikes that were competing in this market are now discarded in graveyards because they fought for dominance and use of free customer outreach using public sidewalks. Though this project we learned how much negative externalities e-scooters and shared bike programs caused and the magnitude of this problem when no regulations were placed.
