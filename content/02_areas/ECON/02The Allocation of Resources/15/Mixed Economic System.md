A mixed economic system is a mixture and **combination of features from a planned and a market economic system**
It seeks to *gain the advantages* of both systems.

![Flowchart illustrating reasons for government intervention in markets: correct market failure, support firms, promote equity, collect government revenue, support poorer households.](media/Flowchart_illustrating_reasons_for_government_intervention_in_markets!_correct_market_failure,_suppo.png)

_**A diagram showing several reasons for government intervention in mixed economic systems**_  

- **To correct market failure:** in many markets there is a **less than optimal allocation** of resources from society's point of view
    - In maximising their self-interest, firms and individuals **will not self-correct** this misallocation of resources and there is a role for the government
    - Governments often achieve this by **influencing** the level of **production or consumption**  
- **Earn government revenue**: governments need money to provide **essential services, public and merit goods**    
    - Revenue is raised through intervention such as taxation, **privatisation**, sale of licenses (e.g. 5G licenses), and the sale of goods/services
- **Promote equity:** to reduce the opportunity gap between the rich and poor  
- **Support firms:** in a global economy, governments choose to **support key industries**so as to help them remain competitive  
- **Support poorer households:** poverty has multiple impacts on both the individual and the economy 
    - Intervention seeks to **redistribute income** (tax the rich and give to the poor) so as to reduce the impact of poverty

- As we have seen in [2.10.3 Government Intervention to Address Market Failure](https://www.savemyexams.com/igcse/economics/cie/20/revision-notes/2-the-allocation-of-resources/2-10-market-failure/2-10-3-government-intervention-to-address-market-failure/), four of the most commonly used methods to intervene in markets are **indirect taxation**, **subsidies**, **maximum prices**, and **minimum prices**  
- Additional methods of intervention include regulation, **nationalisation**, **privatisation**, and the State provision of public goods

---


- ### **Provision of public goods**,
	- funding these through **taxation**
	- this allows everyone to access it
	- promotes consumption and the benefits
	- opportunity cost as the money could be spent elsewhere
	- they are free of charge so they may be over consumed
- ### **subsidies** 
	- for merit goods, more affordable, encourages consumption, higher societal benefit
- ### **taxation** 
	- of demerit goods, raising prices discourages excessive use, reduces consumption
	- *Direct taxation* - direct tax
	- *Indirect taxation* - indirect taxes are imposed on the price of the product. this tax will be regressive, so it will have a greater impact on lower income earners.
	- this raises production costs therefore forcing prices to go up
- ### **regulations and legislations, correct negative externalities or imperfect competition**
	- **Environmental policies**
		- limits on pollution
		- tradable permits: you pollute less you can sell your part of their allocated permits, others who pollute the most will have to buy more of other firms' permits, reducing costs of clean firms and raiding costs of polluting firms. Clean firms should capture a higher market share and pollution should fall
	- **regulations**
		- may *regulate the target audience*, ex. you cannot sell cigarettes to children.
		- **enforcing** safety standards, reduces consumption, increases awareness of the negative for demerit and positive for merit
		- *if the regulations are too strict, there might be illegal markets to provide the product but at a very high price, the government has no control over the quality of the products in underground market. people might break the rules by finding exploits and people will be fined for ignoring must be enforced.*
	- **implementing price controls**
		- [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/15/Maximum and minimum prices]]
		- price floors: protects producers, ex. National minimum wage, agricultural support
		- price ceilings: protects consumers by capping prices, ex. rent control, essential food prices during a crisis
- ### **provision of information**, 
	- reduces asymmetric information, ex. requiring food labels to disclose contents
- ### **Antitrust laws and promotion of competition**
	- monopolies and oligopolies, enforces laws to promote competition and stop firms from exploiting market power, ex. *breaking up monopolies or regulating mergers and acquisitions*
	- removal of barriers to entry and exit into markets
	- prohibition of uncompetitive practices, ex. predatory pricing and limit pricing
		- predatory pricing involves a firm charging a price below the cost to drive a rival firm out of the market
		- limit pricing is setting the price low enough to discourage the entry of new firms into the market
- ### **Redistribution of income**, 
	- addresses inequalities, through *progressive taxation and welfare programs*
- ### **public provision of social safety nets: factor immobility** 
	- governments can provide retraining programs or financial assistance to help.
- ### **environmental policies**



## Intervention to Address Market Failure

- Four of the most commonly used methods to address market failure in markets are **indirect taxation**, **subsidies**, **maximum prices**, **&** **minimum prices**  
    
- Additional methods of intervention include regulation, **nationalisation**, **privatisation**, & State provision of public goods
    
## Maximum Prices
- A **maximum price** is set by the government **below** the existing **free market equilibrium price** and sellers cannot legally sell the good/service at a higher price 
- Governments will often use **maximum prices** in order to help **consumers.** Sometimes they are used for **long periods** of time e.g. housing rental markets. Other times they are **short-term solutions** to unusual price increases e.g. petrol 
![Supply and demand graph showing excess demand. "S" and "D" curves intersect at equilibrium price (Pe) and quantity (Qe). Maximum price (Pmax) leads to shortage between Qs and Qd.](media/Supply_and_demand_graph_showing_excess_demand._!S!_and_!D!_curves_intersect_at_equilibrium_price_(Pe.png)
_**The maximum price (Pmax) sits below the free market price (Pe) & creates a condition of excess demand (shortage)**_

### Diagram analysis
- The initial **market equilibrium** is at PeQe
- A **maximum price** is imposed at **P****max**
    - The lower price **reduces the incentive to supply** and there is a contraction in QS from Qe → Qs
    - The lower price i**ncreases the incentive to consume** and there is an extension in QD from Qe → Qd
    - This creates a condition of **excess demand Q****s****Q****d**   
          


**The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Maximum Prices**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- **Some consumers benefit** as they purchase at lower prices<br>    <br>- They can **stabilise markets in the short-term** during periods of intense disruption e.g. Covid supplies at the start of the pandemic|-  Some consumers are **unable to purchase**due to the shortage<br>    <br>- The unmet demand usually encourages the creation of **illegal markets** (black/grey markets) as desperate buyers turn to illegal bidding<br>    <br>- Maximum prices distort market forces and therefore can result in an **inefficient allocation of scarce resources** e.g. maximum prices in rentals in the property market create a shortage|

## Minimum Prices
- A **minimum price** is set by the government **above** the existing **free market equilibrium price** and sellers cannot legally sell the good/service **at a lower price** 
- Governments will often use **minimum prices** in order to **help producers** or to**decrease consumption of a demerit good** e.g. alcohol 

![Graph showing excess supply with price on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis. Supply (S) and demand (D) intersect at equilibrium price (Pe) and quantity (Qe).](media/Graph_showing_excess_supply_with_price_on_the_y-axis_and_quantity_on_the_x-axis._Supply_(S)_and_dema.png)

_**The imposition of a minimum price (Pmin) above the free market price (Pe) creates a condition of excess supply (surplus)**_

### Diagram analysis
- The initial **market equilibrium** is at PeQe
- A **minimum price** is imposed at **P****min**
    - The higher price **increases the incentive to supply** & there is an extension in QS from Qe → Qs
    - The higher price decreases **the incentive to consume** & there is a contraction in QD from Qe → Qd
    - This creates a condition of **excess supply Q****d****Q****s**   
        
**The Advantages & Disadvantages of Using Minimum Prices in Product Markets**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- **In agricultural markets,** producers benefit as they receive a higher price (Governments will often purchase the **excess supply** & store it or export it) <br>    <br>- When used in **demerit markets****, output falls** (Governments will not purchase the **excess supply** of a demerit good) <br>    <br>- **Producers** usually **lower their output** in the market to match the QD at the minimum price & this helps to reduce the **external costs**|- It costs the government to purchase the excess supply & an **opportunity cost** is involved<br>    <br>- Farmers may become **over-dependent** on the Government's help<br>    <br>- Producers lower output which may result in an **increase in unemployment**in the industry|

#### Minimum prices in labour markets  
- Minimum prices are also used in the **labour market to protect workers** from wage exploitation
    - These are called national **minimum wages** 
- A **national minimum wage (NMW)** is a **legally imposed wage level** that employers must pay their workers
    - It is set **above** the market rate
    - The minimum wage/hour varies **based on age**

![A national minimum wage (NMW1) is imposed above the market wage rate (We) at W1](media/A_national_minimum_wage_(NMW1)_is_imposed_above_the_market_wage_rate_(We)_at_W1.png)

_**A national minimum wage (NMW1) is imposed above the market wage rate (We) at W1**_
#### Diagram analysis
- The **demand for labour (D****L****)** represents the demand for workers by firms
- The **supply of labour (S****L****)** represents the supply of labour by workers
- The **market equilibrium** wage & quantity for truck drivers in the UK is seen at **W****e****Q****e**
- The UK government imposes a **national minimum wage** (NMW) at **W****1**
- Incentivised by higher wages, the **supply of labour increases** from Qe to Qs
- Facing higher production costs, the **demand for labour** by firms **decreases** from Qe to Qd
- This means that **at a wage rate of W****1** there is **excess supply of labour** & the potential for **unemployment** equal to **Q****d****Q****s**

**The Advantages and Disadvantages of a Minimum Wage in Labour Markets**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- Guarantees a **minimum income** for the lowest paid workers<br>    <br>- Higher income levels help to **increase consumption** in the economy<br>    <br>- May **incentivise**workers to be more productive|- Raises the **costs of production** for firms who may respond by **raising the price of goods/services**<br>    <br>- If firms are unable to raise their prices, the introduction of a minimum wage may force them to lay off some workers **(increase unemployment)**|

## Indirect Taxation
- An **indirect tax** is paid on the consumption of goods/services
    - It is only paid if consumers make a **purchase**        
    - It is usually levied by the government on **demerit goods** to reduce the quantity demanded (QD) and/or to raise **government revenue**
    - **Government revenue** is used to fund **government provision of goods/services**e.g education
- Indirect taxes are levied by the government on **producers.** This is why the supply curve shifts 
- **Producers and consumers** each pay a share (**incidence**) of the tax        

![The impact of an indirect tax is split between the consumer (A) & the producer (B)](media/The_impact_of_an_indirect_tax_is_split_between_the_consumer_(A)_&_the_producer_(B).png)
_**The impact of an indirect tax is split between the consumer (A) & the producer (B)**_

### Diagram analysis
- The government places a **specific tax** on a **demerit good**
    - The supply curve shifts left from S1→S2 by the amount of the tax
- The **price the consumer pays has increased** from P1 before the tax, to P2 after the tax
- The **price the producer receives has decreased** from P1 before the tax to P3 after the tax
- The **government receives tax revenue** = (P2-P3) x Q2
    - The **consumer incidence** (share) of the tax is equal to **area A: (P****2****-P****1****) x Q****2**
    - The **producer incidence** (share) of the tax is equal to **area B: (P****1****-P****3****) x Q****2**
- The **QD** in this market has **decreased** from Q1→Q2
    - If the **decrease in QD** is significant enough, it may force producers to **lay off some workers**

  
**The Advantages & Disadvantages of Indirect Taxes**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- **Reduces** the quantity demanded of demerit goods<br>    <br>- **Raises revenue** for government programs|- The **effectiveness of the tax** in reducing the use of demerit goods depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED)<br>    <br>    - Many consumers who purchase products that are price inelastic in demand will **continue to do so**<br>        <br>- It may help **create illegal markets** as consumers seek to avoid paying the taxes<br>    <br>- Producers may be forced to **lay off some workers** as output falls due to the higher prices|

## Producer Subsidies
- A **producer subsidy** is a **per unit** amount of money given to a firm by the government    
    - To **increase production**    
    - To **increase the provision** of a **merit good**
- The way a subsidy is shared between producers & consumers is determined by the **price elasticity of demand (PED)** of the product
    - Producers **keep some** of the subsidy & **pass the rest on** to the consumers in the form of lower prices

![Supply and demand graph with subsidies illustrating benefits and costs. Area A shows consumer benefit, area B shows producer benefit, and A+B represents government subsidy cost.](media/Supply_and_demand_graph_with_subsidies_illustrating_benefits_and_costs._Area_A_shows_consumer_benefi.png)
_**A diagram which demonstrates the cost of a subsidy to the government (A+B) and the share received by the consumer (A) & producer (B)**_
### Diagram analysis
- The original **equilibrium** is at **P****1****Q****1**
- The **subsidy** shifts the supply curve from **S → S + subsidy**:
    - This **increases the QD** in the market from **Q****1****→Q****2**
    - The **new** market **equilibrium** is P2Q2
    - This is a **lower price** and **higher QD** in the market
- Producers receive **P****2** from the consumer **PLUS** the subsidy per unit from the government 
    - Producer revenue is therefore **P****3** **x Q****2**
    - **Producer share** of the subsidy is marked B in the diagram
- The subsidy **decreases the price** that consumers pay from **P****1** **→ P****2**
    - **Consumer share** of the subsidy is marked A in the diagram
- The **total cost** to the government of the subsidy is **(P****3** **- P****2****) x Q****2** represented by **area A+B**  

**The Advantages & Disadvantages of Producer Subsidies**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- Can be **targeted** to helping specific industries<br>    <br>- **Lowers prices** & increases demand for merit goods<br>    <br>- Helps to **change destructive consumer** behaviour over a longer period of time e.g. subsidising electric cars makes them affordable and helps motorists to see them as an option for the masses - & not just the elite|- Distorts the **allocation of resources**in markets e.g. it often results in excess supply when used in agricultural markets<br>    <br>- There is an **opportunity cost**associated with the government expenditure - could the money have been better used elsewhere?<br>    <br>- Subsidies are **prone to political pressure** & lobbying by powerful business interests e.g. most oil companies receive subsidies from their respective governments (despite making $billions in profits each year)|

## Other Government Policy Measures to Address Market Failure

**Other Methods Used To Address Market Failure**

|**Method**|**Explanation**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**State Provision of Public Goods**|- Public goods are **beneficial for society**& are **not provided by private firms** due to the **free rider problem**<br>    <br>- Examples include roads, parks, lighthouses, national defence|- They are usually provided **free at the point of consumption**<br>    <br>- Accessible to everyone regardless of income<br>    <br>- Usually provide both **private & external benefits**to society|- Paid for through **general taxation**<br>    <br>- There is an opportunity cost associated with their provision<br>    <br>- Products which are free may result in **excess demand** & long waiting times e.g. procedures at Public hospitals|
|**Privatisation**|- **Privatisation** occurs when governments transfer **ownership & control** of firms/assets from the State (public sector) to the private sector (private firms)<br>    <br>- Many State firms are monopolies. By privatising them it **encourages more competition** in those markets<br>    <br>- This **should** result in more efficiency & lower prices for consumers|- Increases **government revenue** in the year the asset is sold<br>    <br>- Private firms may run the business **more efficiently**<br>    <br>- The government no longer needs to manage the business or hire people to work for it - this **reduces government expenditure**|- Government assets are often sold well **below their actual market value**<br>    <br>- Private firms often provide a **sub standard good/service** as they cut quality to increase profits<br>    <br>- The price of the good/service usually increases as **firms seek to maximise their profit** e.g. energy prices in the UK market<br>    <br>- Many **privatised companies still maintain considerable market power** & have to be regulated, e.g. water companies|
|**Nationalisation**|- **Nationalisation** occurs when the Government takes control & ownership of firms which were in the private sector|- This can generate efficiencies, especially when delivering **utilities**(gas, water, electricity) to the national population<br>    <br>- It creates more **equity in society**as all citizens have the same access to the same resource at the same price e.g. Norway nationalised much of the oil industry when oil was first discovered in 1972. The profits belong to the citizens<br>    <br>- The business can generate significant **revenue for government**|- Government firms can often run very **inefficiently**<br>    <br>- There is an **opportunity cost**associated with the money required to run it<br>    <br>- The Government may **lack the expertise** to run the business|
|**Regulation**|- Governments **create rules** to limit harm from the **external costs** of consumption/production<br>    <br>- They often create **regulatory agencies** to monitor that the rules are not broken|- Individuals or firms may be **fined/imprisoned**for breaking the rules e.g. selling cigarettes to minors is a punishable offence<br>    <br>- They help to reduce **the external costs** of demerit goods<br>    <br>- Fines can generate extra **government revenue**|- Enforcing laws requires the government to **hire more people**to work for the regulatory agencies<br>    <br>- Enforcing laws can be difficult as it is a complex process to determine if **firms/consumers**are breaking the laws<br>    <br>- The regulation may create **underground (illegal) markets**which could generate even higher external costs on society|


---

The government 
- take into account all the costs and benefits ex. maintain a railway line
- encourage consumption of products that are beneficial ex. subsidies for something that is more beneficial to consumers and others more than they realize
- cares about the externalities
- discourage consumption of harmful products ex. taxes, awareness, legislation
- prevent private sector firms from exploiting consumers
- make the maximum use of resources ex. ensuring that those who are willing are able to find work
- plan head
- help vulnerable groups ex. ensure they have access to basic necessities, create a more even distribution of income by taxing the rich at a high rate, progressive taxation.
