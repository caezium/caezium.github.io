> [!def] Supply
> the **ability and willingness** of firms to **provide [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] and services at given price levels** in a given **time period**.

there is a *positive relationship between price and supply*
- existing firms can earn higher profits if they supply more
- new firms are able to join the market if the higher price allows them to cover production costs

### Movement
movement along a supply curve occurs only if the price of the product changes, this causes a change in quantity supplied
- extension in supply if price increases
- contraction in supply if price decreases

#### Non-price determinants of supply
### **TWO TIPS**
- **T**ime
	- the *shorter the time period* in question, the *less time suppliers have to increase* their output, *so the lower the supply* tends to be.
	- ex. a farmer to increase the supply of agricultural products in a short time period, even if they are offered a high price. over time, their output can be increased.
- **W**eather
	- favorable weathers = more output
- **O**pportunity costs of production options
	- different products they can produce, find which is more profitable

- **T**axes
	- taxes imposed on the supplier adds to the cost of production, *reducing the supply*
- **I**nnovations
	- technological advances means more efficiency and productivity at every price level, *more supply*
- **P**roduction costs
	- less costs = more production, IF *ceteris paribus*, if everything else is the same.
	- innovation
- **S**ubsidies
	- *financial assistance* from the government to help encourage output by reducing costs
	- assist positive stuff in society (ex. bicycles) also gets some funds back from taxes
