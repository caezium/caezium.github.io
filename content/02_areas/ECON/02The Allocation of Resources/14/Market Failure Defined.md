- **Free markets** often work very well 
- However, there is sometimes a **less than optimum** allocation of resources from the **point of view of society.** This is called **Market Failure**
    - Sometimes there is an **over-provision** of goods/services which are harmful **(demerit goods)** and therefore an **over-allocation** of the resources (factors of production) used to make these goods/services e.g. cigarettes 
    - Sometimes there is an **under-provision** of the goods/services which are beneficial (**public goods** and **merit goods**) and therefore an **under-allocation** of the resources (factors of production) used to make these goods/services e.g. schools
    - Sometimes the market causes a **lack of equity** (inequality) - the rich get richer and the poor get relatively poorer
    - Sometimes, **environmental damage** occurs during the production or consumption of a good/service  
- In each of these cases, from society’s point of view there is a lack of **efficiency in the allocation of resources**

## Private, Social and External Costs
- **Externalities** occur when there is an external impact **on a third party** not involved in the economic transaction between the **buyer and seller**
    - These impacts can be **positive or negative** and are often referred to as **spillover effects**
    - These impacts can be on the **production side** of the market (producer supply) or on the **consumption side** of the market (consumer demand)

- **External costs** occur when the **social costs** of an economic transaction are greater than the **private costs**
    - A **private cost** for the producer, consumer or government is **what they actually pay** to produce or consume a good/service e.g. a consumer pays $9 for a McDonald's meal
    - An **external cost** is the damage not factored into the market transaction e.g. the consumer throws their McDonalds packaging onto the street and the Government has to hire cleaners to collect the litter

- The **social cost** includes both the private cost and the cost to society
    - It is a better reflection of the true cost of an economic transaction
    - **Social cost = private cost + external cost** 
        

## Private, Social and External Benefits
- **External benefits** occur when the **social benefits** of an economic transaction are greater than the **private benefits**
    - A **private benefit** for a consumer, producer or government is **what they actually gain** from producing or consuming a good/service e.g. a bee farm gains the **private benefit** of the income from selling their honey
    - An **external benefit (positive externality)** is the benefit not factored in to the market transaction e.g. The bees from the bee farm pollinate the nearby apple orchards 
        
- The **social benefit** includes both the private benefit and the external benefit to society
    - It is a better reflection of the true benefit of an economic transaction
    - **Social benefit = private benefit + external benefit**
