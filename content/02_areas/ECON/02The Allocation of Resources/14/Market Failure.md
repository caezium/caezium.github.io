market failure occurs when the production and/or consumption of a good or service causes additional positive or negative side-effects to a third party not involved in the economic activities.

in other words the market forces of demand and supply fail to allocate the resources efficiently


unsuccessful efficient allocation of resources and when external costs out-weigh external benefits by market forces like demand and supply.




examples
education and healthcare services
- only provided to those who are willing and able to pay
- despite the benefits these bring to society as a whole
street lighting and public roads
- if its under-provided
- producers cannot exclude those who do not pay from benefiting from the provision of these services.

*these are under-provided public goods, which everyone should have*

over-provision of demerit goods
tobacco, alcohol, gambling
- overprovided
- lack of government intervention to regulate production and consumption levels
- huge external costs while the consumer is also taking damage, also need healthcare to help him, work less, family

extraction of oil or construction
- damage to green space
- pollution

monopolists
- abuse their market power
- charging higher prices or supplying lower quantities than if they were faced with competition


spillover

the free market disregards external costs in the graph stuff

marginal social costs marginal private costs and external costs to society

msc == msb is the socially optimal quantity
free market quantity cigarettes overproduced is msc>msb
on price quantity graph

governments levies a per unit tax to achieve optimal quantity, shifts less outputs.

that tax can fix those bad costs or make some merit goods
and less number of people using
if the government totally prevents then there might be radical social costs like rebellions, black markets, or people reverting to badder options of addiction. and some industries like tobacco agriculture and processing and transportation lose money and jobs


examples of benefits
external benefits
positive side0effects of production or consumption experience by third parties for which no money is paid by the ebenficiary

sight and smell of a well-kept garden gives pleasure
the plants and trees also absorb carbon dioxide therefore are good for the natural environment




factor immobility
a final cause of market failure is factor immobility, this occurs when it is difficult for factors of production to move or switch between different users or location.

Geographical immobility
difficult to move a factor of production's geographical location
ex. workers not wanting to move to another country due to social ties or family

Occupational immobility
difficult to move a factor of production to another occupation
