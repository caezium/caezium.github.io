- **Market Failure** occurs when free market activity results in a **less than optimum allocation of resources** from the point of view of society
    

#### failure to take into account all costs and benefits
#### information failure
information asymmetry
public not know
#### short-termism
quick profits and not plan ahead some firms, short sighted approach can result in a lack of investment


**The Causes and Consequences of Market Failure**

| **Cause**                       | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Consequences**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Demerit Goods**               | - These are goods which have **harmful impacts** on consumers/society<br>    <br>- They are often addictive<br>    <br>- E.g. Gambling, alcohol, drugs, sugary foods/drinks                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | - They are **over-provided** in a market and their consumption often creates **external costs**<br>    <br>- Governments often have to **regulate** these goods in such a way that they raise the prices and/or limit the quantities consumed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Merit Goods**                 | - These are goods that are **beneficial to society** but consumers **under-consume** them as they do not fully recognise the **private or external benefits**<br>    <br>- E.g. Vaccinations, education, electric cars                                                                                                                                                                                 | - They are **under-provided** in a market and their consumption generates both **private and/or external benefits**<br>    <br>- Governments often have to **subsidise** these goods in order to lower the price and/or increase the **quantities consumed**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Public Goods**                | - Public goods are beneficial to society but would be **under-provided by a free market** as there is little opportunity for sellers to make profits from providing these goods/services as they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption<br>    <br>- Good examples include national defence, parks, libraries and lighthouses                                                             | - **Non-excludability** refers to the inability of private firms to exclude certain customers from using their products. In effect, the price mechanism cannot be used to exclude customers e.g. street lighting<br>    <br>- **Non-rivalry** refers to the inability of the product to be used up, so there is no competitive rivalry in consumption to drive up prices and generate profits for firms<br>    <br>- Therefore, governments will often provide these beneficial goods themselves, and so they are called **public goods**                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Abuse of Monopoly Power**     | - The development of **monopoly**markets is a natural outcome of a **market system**<br>    <br>- Firms seek to **eliminate competition** by buying out competitors and increasing their ownership of **factors of production**<br>    <br>- With less competition, firms can raise prices, reduce the choice available to consumers, or **limit the supply**                                          | - The outcome is that goods/services are purposely **under-provided**in order to raise prices and profits<br>    <br>- Governments often intervene to ensure that there is **healthy competition** in markets and sufficient provision of goods/services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Factor Immobility**           | - **Factor immobility** occurs when it is difficult for **factors of production**to move or switch between different uses/locations<br>    <br>- The two main types of factor immobility are the **geographical**and **occupational** immobility of labour                                                                                                                                             | - Factor immobility results an **inefficient allocation of resources** in a market (usually under-provision)<br>    <br>- Governments often implement programs to **reduce the factor immobility** in order to raise production and output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **External Costs and Benefits** | - Externalities occur when there is an **external cost or benefit on a third party** not involved in the economic transaction<br>    <br>- These impacts can be **positive or negative**<br>    <br>- The price mechanism in a free market ignores these externalities<br>    <br>- If these external costs/benefits were acknowledged, then the **price and output in the market would be different** | - A **positive externality of consumption** occurs when there is a positive external benefit in consumption, such as when electric vehicles are consumed CO2 emissions fall<br>    <br>- A **positive externality of production** occurs when there is a positive external benefit in production, such as when managed pine forests produce timber but also increase CO2absorption<br>    <br>- A **negative externality of consumption** occurs when there is an external cost in consumption such as when the consumption of alcohol increases anti social behaviour<br>    <br>- A **negative externality of production** occurs when there is an external cost in production such as when the production of electricity increases air pollution |
