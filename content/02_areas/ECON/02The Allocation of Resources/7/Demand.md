>[!def] Demand
> **Demand refers to both the willingness and the ability** of customers to **pay a given price** to buy a good or service. This is sometimes referred to as *effective demand* to distinguish from desires and genuine demand.

> [!def] law of demand
>**demand and price have an inverse relationship.**


two reasons for a inverse:
1. as the price falls, the customers real income rises, with that same amount of income, the customers real is able to buy more products at lower prices *(existing customers buy more)*
2. as the price falls, a higher number of customers are able to pay, so they are more likely to buy the product *(new customers buy)*

### movements along a demand curve - **changes in quantity of demand**
a change in price of a good or service causes a movement along the demand curve.

a price rise will cause a contraction, that is the quantity demanded falls
a reduction in prices will cause an extension

### shift in demand - **changes in demand**
a change in all other non-price factors will cause a shift in demand
an increase in demand, rather than the increase the the quantity demanded, is represented by a rightward shift

	- complements are products that are *jointly demanded*, if the price of one increases, then the demand for its complement is also likely to fall.  (tennis ball and tennis racquets, ipad and apple pencil)
- **A**dvertising
	- marketing messages used to *inform, remind, and persuade* customers to *increase the demand*
- **G**overnment policies
