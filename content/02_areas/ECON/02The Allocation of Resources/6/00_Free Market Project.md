# **The Art of the Free Market: Interpreting Price Mechanism and Resource Allocation**
# Summary
*200 words*
Our artwork illustrates the dynamics of the free market through three distinct scenes of an ice cream vendor and ice cream customers adjusting their demand and supply based on changes in price. The traffic light symbolizes price signals, with green being increase price, yellow being no change, and red being decrease price. We all came up with this idea, the crafting was mainly done by Dora and Carolyn, assisted by Billy, the script and summary was written by Brooklyn and Henry. We made three distinct scenarios of ice cream sales to show the market dynamics. In the first scene, the traffic light is green, so customers cross the road and are able to come and buy ice cream, illustrating high demand, which prompts the vendor to raise prices. This scene shows how price can rise when there is limited supply with high demand. The second scene presents an equilibrium state, where the price of the ice cream matches demand perfectly, This balance ensures both customer satisfaction and vendor profitability. Finally, the third scene addresses a scenario where the traffic light is red and customers are not able to come and buy ice cream, illustrating low demand, which prompts the vendor to lower prices to attract more customers and get rid of excess supply. Together these scenes show the art of the free market where price mechanism and resource allocation work together to balance supply and demand.
## High Demand
In this scenario, the traffic light turns green and in comes a lot of customers, the demand for ice cream exceeds the available supply. The vendor looks at the traffic light and increases the price because it is green. This manages the high demand, the higher prices will decrease demand, ensuring that the limited supply reaches customers who value it most.

card
As the light turns green, customers are able to come and buy ice cream, creating high demand. The vendor increases the price because the light is green, managing the overwhelming amount of customers with the limited supply.
## Equilibrium
Here, there are less people because the light is yellow, the price of ice cream aligns with the demand, creating a stable market. The vendor doesn't change the price and sells just the right amount of ice cream to meet consumer demand without any excess supply. This is called equilibrium, and it is ideal for both the vendor and customers, satisfying both sides.

card
The price and demand are perfectly balanced, allowing the vendor to meet
customer needs while maintaining a steady supply.
## Low Demand
In this final scenario, the traffic light is red, stopping customers from being able to come, the demand for ice cream is too low, resulting in excess supply. To stimulate sales, the vendor lowers the prices. This attracts more customers and clear out surplus inventory because the price is lower.

card
With excess ice cream and insufficient customers, the vendor lowers prices to entice buyers and reduce surplus.






# Supply and demand Jenga
interactive Jenga tower will visually represent the balance between supply and demand din a free market.

**real life - draw candy bar** (the hichew or something thing forgot name, its has a rectangular packaging) stuff on it (price signal can use actual example ex. price high = 10rmb, price low = 2.5rmb, normal price = 5rmb)

Prices act as signals
`price signal` - *arrow* up or down *with actual price* (see above)

**`each block represents a unit of good or service`**

`stability of tower` - symbolizes ***market equilibrium***
- changes in this structure represents how markets can move into *disequilibrium due to price changes* , and then adjust into equilibrium

`supply` - producers make more blocks and places them

`rising demand` - ***remove from bottom*** - increased *production, put blocks bottom* fill in empty space first, to make more (the removal from bottom then putting blocks top represents firms meeting demand so equal supply/adding and demand/removal) - *too tall tower more easily to knock down* (think: earthquakes and stuff)
`falling demand` - ***remove less** blocks* - supply decreases, so firms don't produce and *don't place blocks in the empty spaces* where the blocks were removed. when too many *empty spaces on bottom, it risk destabilizing/falling*
`adjustment to equilibrium` - as blocks are changed, the tower become unstable, the goal is to *remove/add blocks while keeping the tower balanced*, showing how the free market naturally *moves towards equilibrium* over time.



##### practical procedure of removing and adding blocks
*3 part cycle*

//multiple of 3 probably works better, test dif amounts out for optimal visuals/easier presentation
**demand high** = **remove 6** blocks at a time
**production high** = **add** **>6** each time (decide later)

**less demand** = **remove 3** blocks at a time
**less production** = **add 2 blocks** each time (2 or 1, decide later, prob 2)



start of Jenga game: low tower = supply low -> demand high -> price high
therefore leads to more production
tower becomes higher -> more and more unstable cuz taller


then as production and prices increase, demand decreases
therefore less production, price decrease
tower base still gets filled but each time at least one empty space remains, so to remove 3 blocks, 2 blocks from base removed + 1 block from next layer has to be removed, so spaces all the way to the top of the tower if this section cycles, leading to less stable cuz gaps in tower.


price decrease because excess supply (shown by the tower layers that do not have gaps in them), so demand increases again
therefore supply low -> cycle again but closer to equilibrium each time
once all available full layered blocks are removed by one each layer, remove from top -> tower gets shorter -> shorter tower -> less supply
