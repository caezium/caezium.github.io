the market system establishes market [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] where [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] meets [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]. also known as the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/6/Price Mechanism]].



- In a **[[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/6/Market System]]**, prices for [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]]/services are determined by the **interaction of [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] and [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]** 
    - A **market** is any place that brings **buyers** **and** **sellers** together
    - Markets can be **physical** (e.g. McDonald's) or **virtual** (e.g. eBay)
- Buyers and sellers meet to **trade** at an **agreed price**
    - Buyers agree the price **by purchasing** the good/service
    - If they do not agree on the price then they **do not purchase** the good/service and are exercising their **consumer sovereignty**
- Based on this interaction with buyers, **sellers** will gradually **adjust their prices** until there is an **[[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price** and **quantity** that works for both parties
    - At the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price, **sellers** will be satisfied with the **rate/quantity** of sales
    - At the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price, **buyers are satisfied** that the product provides benefits worth paying for


**Market [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]**
exists when the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] for a product matches the [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]] so there is no excess [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]].


price-quantity graphs - an x shape always, with price on the y-axis
The [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/7/Demand]] curve shows that consumers will tend to buy more as the price falls.
The [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]] curve shows that firms tend to offer more for sale as the prices increase.

**Market [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/9/Disequilibrium]]**
occurs when the market price is either above or below the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price. 
	- If the price of a product is above the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price, the product is deemed to be too expensive for consumers, so the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded.
	with excess [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]
, firms reduce price, going back to the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]
	- if the price of the product is below the [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] price, the produce is deemed to be too cheap to attract sufficient [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]], so the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied.
	to create the incentive for more [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/8/Supply]]
, prices increase, going back to [[cabinet/not a file cabinet/02_areas/ECON/9/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]].

# the three key allocation decisions
- *what to produce?*
- *how to produce it?*
- *for whom to produce to?*

the allocation decisions are based on financial incentives. [[02_areas/ECON/02The Allocation of Resources/6/Price Mechanism]]
competition also creates choices and opportunities for firms, consumers thus can benefit from a variety of innovative products at competitive quality and prices.

- **Characteristics of a Market System**

|**Characteristic**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Property Ownership**|- Individuals have the right to **purchase the factors of production**|
|**Freedom of Choice**|- **Individuals** are free to start their own business<br>    <br>- **Firms** are free to decide what they are going to produce, how, and for whom<br>    <br>- **Workers** are free to decide who they are going to work for<br>    <br>- **Consumers** decided what goods/services best meet their wants/needs|
|**Self Interest**|- Entrepreneurs maximise **profits**<br>    <br>- Workers maximise **wages**<br>    <br>- Consumers maximise their well-being/satisfaction|
|**Limited Government Intervention**|- A pure market economy has no government intervention<br>    <br>- Most free market economies have a **low level of intervention,** usually in the form of taxation, provision of defence, healthcare and education|
|**Price Mechanism**|- Changes in prices **allocate scarce resources**<br>    <br>- Rising prices indicate a **shortage** of resources and falling prices indicate a **surplus** of resources|

**The Advantages and Disadvantages of Market Economies**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- Profit incentive **motivates** people **to work** or develop entrepreneurial ideas<br>    <br>- **Greater variety** of goods/services<br>    <br>- Competition leads to **better quality** of goods/services<br>    <br>- Competition leads to **lower prices** of goods/services<br>    <br>- Competition encourages **innovation** and product development<br>    <br>- Profits, income and wealth are unlimited resulting in **better standards of living**<br>    <br>- More **efficient** use of scarce resources|- **Wealth** gets concentrated in the hands of the few as they are able to keep **buying up** the scarce factors of production<br>    <br>- This **increases inequality** such that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow<br>    <br>- Sometimes **product quality falls** as firms lower quality standards in order to **increase profits**<br>    <br>- Workers get **exploited**<br>    <br>- **Resource depletion** and **environmental degradation** are often ignored<br>    <br>- **Monopolies** develop as firms **increase market power** through mergers and acquisitions<br>    <br>- This leads to **exploitation** of consumers and supply chains|
