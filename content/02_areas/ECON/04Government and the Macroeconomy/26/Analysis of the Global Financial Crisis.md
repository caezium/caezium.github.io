The financial crisis of 2008 was the most severe global economic shock since the Great Depression. It prompted a multifaceted and highly controversial government response that deployed the full arsenal of fiscal, monetary, and regulatory power.





The crisis originated in the U.S. housing market, which had become a massive bubble fueled by years of low interest rates and an explosion in risky “subprime” mortgage lending. These were high-risk loans that were packaged into complex and opaque securities and sold to financial institutions around the globe, spreading the risk far beyond the U.S. housing market.
This activity took place within a vast and lightly regulated “shadow banking system” that operated without traditional safeguards of commercial banking.

When U.S. house prices began falling in 2006-2007 and subprime borrowers started defaulting in large numbers, the value of these mortgage-backed securities collapsed. This inflicted enormous losses on banks, investment firms, and insurance companies worldwide, triggering a crisis of confidence.

The government’s response was initially only for the spur of the moment and inconsistent. 
The rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008 was followed by the decision to let Lehman Brothers declare bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. 
This inconsistency shattered market confidence, sparking a full-blown global panic that froze credit markets and brought the international financial system to the brink of collapse.

The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke – a renowned scholar of the Great Depression – acted with overwhelming force to prevent the mistakes of the 1930s. The Fed deployed both traditional and entirely new, unconventional tools:

**Interest Rate Cuts:** The Fed aggressively cut its benchmark federal funds rate, bringing it to a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent by December 2008 – effectively zero.

**Lender of Last Resort:** Invoking its emergency powers, the Fed created a host of new lending facilities to provide liquidity to traditional banks and a wide range of critical financial market participants, including primary dealers, money market mutual funds, and the commercial paper market.

**Quantitative Easing:** With short-term interest rates at zero, the Fed initiated Large-Scale Asset Purchases, more commonly known as Quantitative Easing. The Fed electronically created money to buy trillions of dollars in long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, designed to directly lower long-term interest rates and inject massive amounts of cash into the financial system.

In October 2008,  Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which created the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41427). TARP authorized the U.S. Treasury to use up to $700 billion to stabilize the system.

The initial plan was for the Treasury to buy the “troubled” or “toxic” mortgage-backed securities clogging up bank balance sheets. However, policymakers quickly realized this would be slow and difficult to implement. They pivoted to a more direct and effective strategy: injecting capital directly into the nation’s banks by purchasing preferred stock.

This Capital Purchase Program was the largest component of TARP. Funds were also used for a massive rescue of insurance giant AIG and to provide emergency loans to prevent the collapse of the U.S. auto industry, specifically General Motors and Chrysler.

TARP was intensely controversial, widely perceived by the public as a “blank check” to bail out the very Wall Street firms that had caused the crisis. However, the final financial accounting was far more favorable than anticipated.

The original $700 billion authorization was later reduced to $475 billion. In total, $443.5 billion was disbursed across all TARP programs. Through repayments, interest, dividends, and asset sales, the government ultimately collected $443.1 billion. The [final lifetime cost to taxpayers](https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/about-tarp) was approximately $31.1 billion, with most of that cost attributable to homeowner assistance programs rather than bank bailouts.

**Bank Stress Tests:** In early 2009, the Fed led “stress tests” of the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies. By publicly assessing their financial health and forcing the weaker ones to raise more money,  restoring investor confidence and stabilizing the banking sector.



With the economy shedding nearly 800,000 jobs a month, the newly inaugurated Obama administration pushed for massive fiscal stimulus. The [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009), signed into law in February 2009, was an $831 billion package of government spending and tax cuts.

### Success or Failure?

The overwhelming consensus among economists who have analyzed the crisis response is that the combined actions – TARP, the Fed’s liquidity programs, and ARRA – were a messy but resounding success in their primary goal: preventing a second Great Depression.
Economic models from analysts Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi estimate that without the policy responses, the U.S. would have suffered a peak-to-trough GDP decline of nearly 14 percent (instead of the actual 4 percent) and unemployment would have soared to almost 16 percent (instead of its peak of 10 percent).


Overall verdict
Overall, the government’s 2008–2009 response was economically effective at its core goal, stopping a depression, by using tools that targeted different failures, leading to rate cuts, emergency lending, lowered borrowing costs, restoring confidence, and boosted demand. These actions reduced unemployment and output losses, with surprisingly low net fiscal cost. However, limitations remain: benefits were uneven (asset-price gains favored wealthier households), stimulus size and duration were constrained by politics, and heavier reliance on monetary policy carried longer-run financial stability risks. Most importantly, explicit rescues of large institutions may have reinforced “too big to fail”.

# **Poster Layout: 

### **1. Causes: A Perfect Storm**

show a brief timeline of the collapse

- **Early 2000s:** Housing boom fueled by risky "subprime" mortgages.
- **2007:** Subprime defaults surge, causing stress in financial markets.
- **Sept 2008:** Lehman Brothers fails, triggering a global panic and credit freeze.
- **Dec 2007 - Jun 2009:** The U.S. enters its longest recession since WWII.

**Core Drivers of the Crisis:**

- **Risky Lending:** Subprime mortgages were given out with little oversight.
- **Complex Finance:** Mortgages were bundled into complex, high-risk products (MBS, CDOs) and sold globally.
- **High Leverage:** Banks were over-leveraged, making them vulnerable to losses.
- **Lack of Regulation:** The "shadow banking" system operated with minimal oversight.
- **Demand-Side Shock:** The credit freeze caused a sudden and massive fall in **Aggregate Demand** as spending and investment stopped.

---

### **2. Macroeconomic Impact on the U.S.**

use simple line charts to show the changes

- **Economic Growth (GDP):**
    - **What happened?** Negative economic growth. Real GDP fell **-5.1%** from late 2007 to mid-2009.
    - **Why?** A sharp fall in **Aggregate Demand (AD)** as both Consumer Spending (C) and business Investment (I) collapsed due to the credit crunch and loss of wealth.
- **Unemployment:**
    - **What happened?** A surge in **cyclical unemployment**. The rate peaked at **10.2%** in Oct 2009 (over 7 million jobs lost).
    - **Why?** As AD fell, firms cut production and laid off workers to reduce costs, leading to widespread unemployment tied to the economic downturn.
- **Price Stability (Inflation):**
    - **What happened?** The aim of low, stable inflation was missed; the economy experienced **deflation** (falling prices) in 2009.
    - **Why?** The severe fall in **Aggregate Demand** created strong deflationary pressure, as there was too little spending in the economy.

---

### **3. Policy Responses to the Recession**

**Expansionary Monetary Policy (The Federal Reserve)**
- **Goal:** Increase Aggregate Demand by making borrowing cheaper.
- **Action:** Cut interest rates to near-zero to encourage consumer spending (C) and business investment (I).
- **Action:** Began **Quantitative Easing (QE)** to increase the **money supply** and inject liquidity into frozen credit markets.

**Expansionary Fiscal Policy (The U.S. Government)**
- **Goal:** Increase Aggregate Demand directly and through multiplier effects.
- **Action:** Increased **Government Spending (G)** via the ARRA stimulus package on infrastructure and aid.
- **Action:** Bank bailouts (TARP) and **tax cuts** to restore confidence and encourage spending (C).

**Evaluation: Did the Policies Work?**

| Pros                                             | Cons                                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Averted a full-scale depression.                 | Created a large **budget deficit** and increased national debt.       |
| Stabilized the financial system.                 | Public backlash against "bailouts" created **moral hazard** concerns. |
| Restored confidence and lowered borrowing costs. | The economic recovery was slow and uneven.                            |

**Overall Judgment:** The combined expansionary policies were successful in preventing a catastrophe by boosting Aggregate Demand. However, the recovery was slow, and the policies had significant drawbacks, including a massive increase in government debt.

# The Global Financial Crisis (2007–2009)
## 1. What happened and why
- Timeline
    - Housing boom (early–mid 2000s) → rising subprime lending and securitization
    - 2007: Subprime mortgage delinquencies surge; funding markets strain
    - 2008: Bear Stearns rescue (Mar), Fannie/Freddie taken into conservatorship (Sep), Lehman Brothers fails (Sep 15), AIG bailed out (Sep), credit freeze; late-2008 output collapse
    - NBER dates the recession from Dec 2007 to Jun 2009 (longest since WWII)
- Core causes (cause → mechanism)
    - Subprime mortgage boom and lax underwriting → higher defaults once rates reset/falling home prices
    - Securitization (MBS/CMO, CDOs) and weak risk management → losses spread through the financial system
    - Over-leverage and short-term wholesale funding at large institutions → run dynamics when collateral lost value
    - Inadequate oversight of complex products and shadow banking → systemic vulnerabilities amplified
    - Shock events (Lehman failure) → panic, interbank lending freeze, severe tightening of credit

## 2. Macroeconomic impact on the U.S.
- Real GDP growth
    - Deep contraction over the recession. BEA revisions show cumulative real GDP fell about 5.1% from 2007 Q4 to 2009 Q2; the worst quarterly drops were 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1.
    - Notable quarters (annualized rates, revised): 2008 Q4 around -8.9%; 2009 Q1 around -6.7%. NBER trough in June 2009, then weak expansion.
    - Interpretation: Credit shock and wealth losses caused a sharp drop in consumption, investment, trade, and inventories.
- Unemployment
    - Unemployment peaked at about 10.0–10.2% in late 2009 (BLS October 2009 report shows 10.2%). Payrolls fell by ~7+ million from Dec 2007 to late 2009.
    - Long-term unemployment (27+ weeks) rose sharply; employment-population ratio fell to ~58.5% by Oct 2009.
    - Interpretation: Businesses cut jobs rapidly amid collapsing demand, tight credit, and uncertainty.
- Inflation (CPI)
    - Headline inflation flipped into year-over-year declines in parts of 2009, largely due to energy price collapse; several monthly CPI releases in 2009 show negative 12-month changes.
    - Core CPI stayed positive but subdued (~1.8–1.9% YoY in early/mid 2009).
    - Interpretation: Demand destruction and energy price plunge brought disinflation/temporary deflation, while core remained modest.

- Trade balance: Global trade fell sharply; strong dollar in late 2008 hurt exports.
- Household wealth: Equity and housing price collapses cut household net worth, deepening the consumption fall.
- Government debt: Federal deficits surged due to automatic stabilizers, rescues, and stimulus.

## 3. Government and Fed responses
- Monetary policy (Federal Reserve)
    - Interest rates: Fed cut the federal funds rate to near zero by Dec 2008.
    - Liquidity/credit programs: New facilities to backstop markets and institutions (e.g., Term Auction Facility; support for commercial paper; interventions around Bear Stearns, AIG).
    - Quantitative easing: Large-scale asset purchases to lower long-term rates and stabilize mortgage and credit markets.
    - Evaluation: Pros—stabilized funding markets, reduced systemic panic, lowered borrowing costs. Cons—unconventional tools were controversial; recovery remained slow; moral hazard concerns.
- Fiscal policy (Federal Government)
    - TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program, Oct 2008): Capital injections into banks, AIG support, later housing/auto assistance.
    - ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Feb 2009): ~$787B stimulus via tax cuts, unemployment extensions, state aid, and infrastructure.
    - Evaluation: Pros—reduced tail risk of financial collapse; boosted demand and confidence; aided labor market stabilization. Cons—public backlash over “bailouts”; uneven housing relief; higher federal debt; recovery slower than typical postwar rebounds.

- The crisis originated mainly from the U.S. housing market, where house prices peaked around mid-2006 followed by a sharp rise in mortgage defaults, especially among subprime borrowers who had poor credit and high default risk.
    
- Leading up to the crisis, there was excessive risk-taking fueled by a favorable economic environment characterized by strong growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and low interest rates. This encouraged households and investors to borrow imprudently to buy homes and flip properties for short-term profit.
    
- Banks and lenders increased risky lending, often without assessing borrowers’ ability to repay loans, because loans were bundled into complex mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold to investors globally. These securities were wrongly rated as low risk.
    
- Financial institutions across the globe including U.S. banks and foreign banks invested heavily in these MBS products, spreading the risk internationally.
    
- The collapse of the housing bubble, and rising mortgage defaults, caused the value of these securities to drop sharply, triggering a cascade of losses in banks, credit institutions, and investors worldwide, leading to a freeze in credit markets.
    
- Other contributing systemic factors included excessive leverage, maturity transformation problems, inadequate regulation and supervision, and interconnectedness of financial institutions.
    
- The crisis escalated from a subprime mortgage problem into a worldwide financial system collapse and a severe global recession.

- Recovery was slow, with lingering high unemployment and cautious lending even after the recession technically ended in 2009. Inflation remained subdued in the years following.
    

**Fiscal Policy:**

- The government deployed massive bailout programs, notably the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which allocated $700 billion to stabilize banks and large financial firms by purchasing toxic assets and equity stakes.
    
- The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included large-scale government spending aimed at preserving existing jobs, creating new employment opportunities, and stimulating economic demand.
    
- Pros: These fiscal measures helped restore confidence in the banking system, prevented further bankruptcies, and cushioned the recession's blow to the labor market.
    
- Cons: The stimulus increased government debt substantially, and critics argue some funds were inefficiently used or exacerbated moral hazard by bailing out risky institutions.
    

**Monetary Policy:**

- The Federal Reserve rapidly cut interest rates to near zero and launched unprecedented quantitative easing programs, purchasing trillions of dollars in government and mortgage-backed securities to inject liquidity.
    
- The Fed also created new lending facilities to provide credit to banks, businesses, and consumers, stabilizing key financial markets.
    
- Pros: These actions calmed the frozen credit markets, lowered borrowing costs, and supported economic recovery.
    
- Cons: Quantitative easing raised concerns about future inflation risks and asset bubbles, with uneven benefits across different sectors.

    

**Overall Evaluation:**

- The combined fiscal and monetary responses were largely effective in preventing a deeper Great Depression–style collapse and laid the foundation for recovery.
    
- However, recovery was slow with prolonged high unemployment, and the policies sparked debates on financial regulation, income inequality, and the role of government intervention.
    
- The crisis spurred reforms improving banking sector resilience but also highlighted challenges in managing systemic risk and moral hazard.

1. **Research and Analysis:**

- **Causes:**

Provide a brief overview of the chosen economic event, including its timeline and the main causes that led to the event. Clearly explain why and how the event occurred.

- **Macroeconomic Impact:**

Focus on the major macroeconomic impacts of the event on the relevant countries. Analyze aspects:

**Must cover:** **GDP growth, unemployment, inflation,** 

**Optional aspects: trade balance, living standard, or government debt.**

Support your analysis **with relevant data and statistics** to provide a clear understanding of the event's economic consequences.

(Extra help to make your life easier [you’re welcome]: remember: analyze means cause and effect, e.g. increased sleep leads to increased health; in the context of this project, your analysis will focus on what your event did to GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, etc.). 

  

- **Government Responses:**

Write **a brief paragraph** discussing how the governments of the affected countries responded to the economic challenges posed by the event. Include information on fiscal policies (government spending), monetary policies (interest rate), and other measures taken to address the issues. Discuss the effectiveness. 

(Extra help to make your life easier [you’re welcome]: remember, evaluate means to look at both sides of an issue [advantages and disadvantages], and then make a judgment / give a conclusion. **Example:** Question**:** _Evaluate whether increasing taxes is a good way to reduce pollution._

You should:

1. Explain **how** higher taxes could reduce pollution ✅
2. Discuss the possible **problems or drawbacks** of higher taxes ❌
3. Finish with a **balanced conclusion** – e.g., “It can help, but it depends on how the money is used.”

Tip to Remember: Evaluate = Pros + Cons + Your Final Judgment

In the context of this project, you will look at the good outcomes of the policy and bad outcomes of the policy and then conclude overall if worked well, so so, or poorly).
