The quantity and quality of the [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Factors of Production]] will change if there is a change in the demand for the supply.
	changes in the costs of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Factors of Production]]
		ex. higher [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Labor]] costs caused by an increase in the national minimum wage.
	innovation
		ex. better education means higher quality of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Labor]], better technologically advanced [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] means better quality and can reduce the quantity needed.
Government policies can also affect the costs of production.
ex. the use of taxes and subsidies. lower income taxes can help create incentives to work, increasing the quantity of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Labor]] resources. subsidies reduce the production costs, increasing output of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] and services.

Innovation and new technologies allow firms to produce more output. higher productivity also enables firms to cut their costs.

Bad weather conditions (ex. droughts or floods) reduce the supply of agricultural products. good weather might also increase supply.


## [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Land]]
#### Quantity
the amount of physical [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Land]] in existence does not change much.
there is a certain degree of soil erosion and [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Land]] reclamation.
#### Quality
fertilizers can be applied to increase the fertility of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Land]] to increase the quality.

#### Quantity
investment and tend to increase with time
	old [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] will be worn out or become outdated, needing new [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] to replace the old ones.
		the total value of the output of the [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] is **gross investment**. the value of the replaced [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] good is called **depreciation**. net investment is the value of extra [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Capital]] [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] that have been made.
#### Quality
