We can use [[Value of Statistical Life]] in some way to determine who gets more priority.

Prioritization Proposal:

1. C: 3yo long potential future, young age
2. A: 6yo awaiting transplant in one year, high recovery chance
3. G: 30yo female with two young children, the dependents make her need significant
4. H: 30yo male with two young children, similar to G but less urgent.
5. E: 7yo child with three siblings, young with a large family
6. F: 8 yo child, no siblings however requires slightly more time than E
7. J: 45yo man awaiting a transplant in six months
8. I: 30yo male, no children.
9. D: 78yo female, age and shorter life expectancy
10. B: 55yo man with grown children, less urgent due to age and dependency status.
11. K: 65yo man with a promise to donate. The immediate need is high, but the promise is less certain compared to current needs.

This prioritization balances immediate medical needs, potential future contributions to society, and the impact on their dependents.
There can be other ways such as first come first serve, shortest hours to save more people, etc etc.
