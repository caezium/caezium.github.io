Economics can explain real-world events, issues, and problems.
ex. a doctor or lawyer makes more money than the average office worker. 
a can of coco-cola in space costs around 2000$
luxury sport cars cost more than 10x normal cars.

[[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Dialysis Machine Allocation Dilemma]]
**The nature of the economic problem is that there are finite resources and unlimited wants.**
In every country, resources are limited in supply and decisions have to be made by governments, firms, and individuals about how to allocate scarce resources to satisfy their unlimited needs and wants.
	This basic economic problem exists in every economy.
There is always this psychological drive of wanting something better.
Choices have to be made about how resources are to be used.

>[!def] 
The Basic Economic Problem is concerned with how best to allocate scarce resources
in order to satisfy people's unlimited needs and wants. #todo make this sticky note.

>[!hint]
Resources: factors used to produce [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] and services.
Scarcity: a situation where there is not enough to satisfy everyone's wants.

the economic problem in different contexts
	- consumers have a finite amount of money and income, they cannot have everything they want.
	- students have to select what courses to study.
	- workers have to make choices about what jobs they do.
	- farmers cannot grow rice and wheat on the same land. they have to select one crop as land is scarce.
	- the government has to decide how to spent tax revenue. dividing to build a new hospital ma mean that it cannot build a new school.

### Essentially, economics is the study of how resources are allocated to best satisfy the unlimited needs and wants of individuals, governments, and firms, in an economy.
Unlimited wants exceed limited resources.
Unlimited wants + limited resources =  **Scarcity**


## Agents
The three main economic agents/decision makers are:
- individuals or households
- firms
- the government
The three basic economic questions addressed by economic agents are:
- what to produce?
- how to produce it?
- for whom to produce it?

**[[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods|Goods]] are physical** items
	tangible
	can be produced, bought and sold.
	ex. furniture, clothing, stationary
**Services are non-physical** items
	non-tangible YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT!!
	ex. haircuts, education, telephone calls, internet access

- Tertiary sector - third stage, focuses on providing services that support the primary and secondary sectors and cater directly to consumers
