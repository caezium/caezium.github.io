> [!def] PPC
a curve that shows the **maximum combination of any two** categories of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/1/Goods]] and services that can be produced in an economy.

![[IMG_4904.jpeg]]
Any point on the curve means that the maximum use is being made of the resources, an efficient output. Here, there are more Good A than Good B, we are making more Good A at the expense ([[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/3/Opportunity Cost]]) of Good B.
Point X is under/inside the curve, meaning that the output being produced did not fully use the resources, inefficient. 
	Spare capacity - magnitude of point to the closet point on the curve maybe
Point Z is impossible, as it is outside the curve.
These points are called **production points**.


Economic Growth
refers to the increase in a country's real gross domestic product (GDP) over time
more area under PPC means more economic growth / **PPC shift**


1. The PPC can shift when theres an increase or decrease in the quality or quantity of the [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Factors of Production]]. Increase: innovation, education, growth rate, immigration.
2. A PPC can show scarcity by showing how much resources is needed to make a product/service and how those resources can be used to make a lot of another product/service (a very steep line). A PPC can also show [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/3/Opportunity Cost]] by showing us the tradeoffs of making more of one product. A PPC can also show efficiency by illustrating where the production point is, if the point is inside the curve, than the production is not efficient, if the point is on the curve, then the production is efficient.

Scarcity: boundary of curve

[[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/3/Opportunity Cost]]: movement of production point, tradeoffs

Efficiency: on or inside curve.


inefficiency can come from not using them, or not using them correctly for a maximum output.


PPCs are usually bowed outwards because the best resources are used first to produce a particular product.
in a less common situation, resources are equally suited to producing both types of products, the [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/3/Opportunity Cost]] remains constant, the PPC is shown as a straight line.


**inwards shift:**
	reduction in quantity or quality of resources
	ex. war, disease, deaths
**outwards shift:**
	increase in quantity or quality of the resources.
	ex. increase in the size of [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Labor]] force, education


	more jobs created
	more products for the public
	improvement in the standard of living
an outwards shift might not always be good
	environmental degradation - overuse, depletion of resources
	economic growth may not be evenly distributed, some sectors might benefit greatly such as [[02_areas/ECON/01The Basic Economic Problem/2/Enterprise]].
	overproduction - leading to waste
	diminishing returns - additional input results in smaller increase in output
	technological innovation may drive people to unemployment




movement along ppc is a reallocation of resources form the output of one product for another

potential or maximum combination of two products that can be produced when using all resources efficiently to their maximum abilities.
