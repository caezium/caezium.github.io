#### Causes of the growth of firms
Firms can grow either internally or externally
internally ex. increasing their market share
externally ex. mergers

---
##### Internal Growth
internal growth or organic growth occurs when firms expand using their own resources
they can grow by increasing number of branches, ex. stores, within a particular country
they can also expand by selling their products in a greater number of countries to increase its market share

---
##### External Growth
external growth or inorganic growth occurs when expansion involves another organization, such as through mergers, takeover, and franchises.

> [!def] Mergers
> A merger occurs when two or more firms join together to form just one firm

mergers can eliminate competition by creating one big market to dominate the market share.
laws are involved though.
two companies can form a monopoly -> ex. prices can go up
different types of mergers will be covered later.


> [!def] Takeovers
> occurs when one firm is taken over by another firm, it can be hostile or the two firms might have agreed to a takeover.

Takeovers can be voluntary or hostile. Voluntary might be because they need another companies help/tech to survive. Hostile is buy.

##### Mergers
Horizontal
Vertical and
Conglomerate

These types also apply to takeovers

>[!def] Horizontal merger
>occurs when two or more firms in the same economic sector **of industry** integrate


Primary
Secondary
Tertiary
Consumer





Vertical then means in the same economic sectors.
owning vertical sectors can reduce risk or scale.
owning the whole chain can be more efficient


>[!def] Vertical merger
>occurs when two or more firms in the same industry and economic sector join


A backward vertical merger occurs when a firm from the secondary sector merges with a firm from the primary sector
a forward vertical merger occurs when a firm from the secondary sector merges with like the tertiary

benefits of backward vertical integration
- control over quality 
- price falls




---
conglomerates can produce different products

>[!def] Conglomerate Merger
>occurs when two or more firms in different economic sectors and in unrelated areas of business integrate.
>

They may form a single company or be part of a large group of companies
Diversification spreads risk.

all the merged firms can benefit from:
- having higher market share
- gaining skilled employees from each other
- operating with fewer employees
	- ex no need to hire two finance departments
	- reduce costs of production
- take advantage of economics of scale

but there are still drawbacks:
- duplication of resources, so some workers may lose their jobs. Job losses can cause anxiety, demotivate staff and lead to a fall in productivity
- the newly formed, larger firm may face increasing costs arising from diseconomies of scale
- may suffer from culture clash within the separate corporate cultures. may cause communication and organizational problems



---


> [!def] Franchising
> A business buying/using the same brand name or person's name or their technology, same supply chain. like McDonalds owning more store chains.

franchises can ask the franchise owner to give them the technology, brand name, same supply chain, and managing stuff to open more store chains.

## Internal and External Growth

- The growth of firms can be **organic** (internal) or **inorganic** (external)
    
- **Organic growth** is usually generated by
    
    - Gaining greater **market share**
        
    - **Product diversification**
        
    - Opening a new store
        
    - International expansion
        
    - Investing in **new technology**/production machinery
        
- **Inorganic growth** usually takes place when firms merge in one of three ways
    
    - **Vertical integration** (forward or backwards)
        
    - **Horizontal integration**
        
    - **Conglomerate integration**

_**A diagram that illustrates how a firm can grow through forward or backward vertical integration**_

- **Forward** **vertical integration** involves a **merger** or **takeover** with a firm further forward in the supply chain
    
    - E.g. A dairy farmer merges with an ice-cream manufacturer 
        
- **Backward vertical integration** involves a merger/takeover with a firm further backward in the supply chain
    
    - E.g. An ice-cream retailer takes over an ice-cream manufacturer
        

## Types of Mergers

- Firms will often **grow organically** to the point where they are in a financial position to**integrate** with others
    
    - Integration speeds up growth but also creates new challenges  
         
        

**An Explanation of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Type of Growth**

|**Type of Growth**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|---|
|**Organic**|- The **pace of growth** is manageable<br>    <br>- **Less risky** as growth is financed by profits and there is expertise in the industry<br>    <br>- Avoids **diseconomies of scale**<br>    <br>- The management know and understand every part of the business|- The pace of growth can be slow and frustrating<br>    <br>- Not necessarily able to benefit from **economies of scale**<br>    <br>- Access to **finance** may be limited|
|**Vertical Integration**  <br>(Inorganic growth)|- Reduces the **cost of production** as middle man profits are eliminated<br>    <br>- Lower costs make the firm more **competitive**<br>    <br>- Greater control over the supply chain **reduces risk** as access to raw materials is more certain<br>    <br>- **Quality** of raw materials can be controlled<br>    <br>- Forward integration adds **additional profit** as the profits from the next stage of production are assimilated<br>    <br>- Forward integration can increase **brand visibility**|- **Diseconomies of scale**occur as costs increase e.g. unnecessary duplication of management roles<br>    <br>- There can be a **culture clash**between the two firms that have merged<br>    <br>- Possibly **little expertise** in running the new firm results in **inefficiencies**<br>    <br>- The price paid for the new firm may take a long time to recoup|
|**Horizontal Integration**  <br>(Inorganic growth)|- Rapid increase of **market share**<br>    <br>- Reductions in the cost per unit due to **economies of scale**<br>    <br>- Reduces competition<br>    <br>- Existing knowledge of the industry means the merger is more likely to be successful<br>    <br>- Firm may gain new**knowledge or expertise**|- **Diseconomies of scale** may occur as costs increase e.g. unnecessary duplication of management roles<br>    <br>- There can be a **culture clash**between the two firms that have merged|
|**Conglomerate Integration**  <br>(Inorganic growth)|- Reduces overall **risk** of business failure<br>    <br>- Increased size and connections in new industries opens up **new opportunities for growth**<br>    <br>- Parts of the new business may be **sold for profit** as they are duplicated in other parts of the conglomerate|- Possible **lack of expertise** in new products/industries<br>    <br>- **Diseconomies of scale** can quickly develop<br>    <br>- Usually results in job losses<br>    <br>- **Worker dissatisfaction** due to unhappiness at the takeover can reduce **productivity**|
