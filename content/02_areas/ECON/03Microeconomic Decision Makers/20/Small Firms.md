#### Why are there small firms co-existing and why are they small
Small firms might operate in small markets with limited ceiling for profit
**Market Niche**
ex.
a small grocery store has to find a way to compete with supermarkets and it might do so by providing a range of goods which cannot be bought at a supermarket, such as cheeses and wines or candy.
The small grocery store may be located in a remote area and be the only local seller of those provisions.


**Adaptability**
Smaller shops can also adapt quickly to changing consumer tastes

##### Advantages of small firms
**few legal formalities exist**
startup costs are usually much lower, and sole proprietorships are quite easy to set up

the sole trade is the only owner of a firm and receives all of the profits, **higher incentive**

Small businesses are likely to **know their customers** on a more personal level
ex. someone going to a breakfast shop everyday

**Easier to manage and control**
**diseconomies of scale**

##### Disadvantages of small firms
**limited start up capital**
can't raise a lot of finance to establish the business
sole traders might only be able to use their personal savings
lack sources of finance plans available to small firms

**largest risk of business failure** (statistically backed)
80% closed after 2 years
even successful ones usually face intense competition due to the vast number of small firms that exist.
presence of larger and more established firms often pose a huge threat to the survival of smaller firms

**depends on the abilities and commitment of the owners**
BASED

**suffer from a lack of continuity**
if owner holiday or illness, they might not be able to operate the whole company

**higher unit costs of production**
their prices might be less competitive than those of large competitors
