## Objectives of Firms

- The **objectives** of a firm are a **reason for their existence** or the desired focus of their owners
    
    - These objectives typically include profit maximization, growth, survival and social welfare 
        

### 1. Profit maximisation 

- Most firms have the **rational** objective of profit maximization
    
- Profit = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Costs (TC)
    
- To maximize profits, firms can either **increase their sales revenue** or **decrease their costs**
    
    - Firms continuously analyze their costs to see if they can reduce them so that profit can be maximize
        

### 2. Growth

- Some firms have the business objective of **growth**
    
- In subtopic 3.5 we considered the different metrics that firms use to **compare their size** which include the number of employees, market share, size of profits and market capitalization
    
- Firms with a growth objective often focus on increasing their **sales revenue** or **market share**
    
- Firms will also **maximize revenue** in order to increase output and benefit from **economies of scale**
    
- A growing firm is **less likely to fail**
    

### 3. Survival 

- In the short term, many new firms focus solely on **business survival**
    
- Generally, as much as **25% of new firms fail** in their first year of business
    
- Once a firm is established, it may then begin to focus on **profit maximization** as its new objective
    

### 4. Social welfare 

- More firms than ever are launching with a **social welfare objective**
    
    - These typically include a focus on **climate action and addressing poverty or inequality**
        
- They still **require profit to survive**, but will accept less than if they were profit maximizing as long as they are meeting their social objective
