In preparing goods/services for sale, **firms incur a range of costs**. These costs can be be broken into different categories



> [!def] Fixed Costs (FC) 
> are the costs of production that have to be paid regardless of the production output levels

E.g. Building rent, management salaries, insurance, bank loan repayments etc.



> [!def] Variable Costs (VC)
>  are the costs of production that change when the level of output changes. 

eg. raw materials, component parts, payment of wages of workers directly involved with production, buildings.
The total variable cost line start at the origin because when there is no output, there is no variable cost.


- **Total Costs (TC) refers to the variable costs plus the fixed costs**

- **Average fixed cost (AFC) is the fixed cost per unit**
	- more output = fixed costs are divided by a greater quantity of output
	- so AFC continually declines.
	- *= fixed cost / output level*
- **Average variable cost (AVC) is the variable cost of production per unit of output**
	- the shape of this allow the economies of scale to allow firms to enjoy falling AVC, but then diseconomies, will increase AVC as they overproduce
	- *= variable cost / output level*
- **Average total cost**
	- *gives us the info of the cost of one unit*
	- this is important, directly tells them pricing they should sell at for revenue and a good profit margin
	- *= total cost/output level*

## Diagrammatic Representation of Costs

**Sketches Which Represent the Different Costs of a Firm**

|**Type of Cost**|**Diagram**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixed Cost (FC)**|![[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/22/attachments/b0925a4a5a6769cea3370ab20e5944db_MD5.png]]|- The firm has to pay its **fixed costs** which do not change, irrespective if the output is 0 or 100,000 units<br>    <br>- The fixed costs for this firm are $4,000|
|**Variable Cost (VC)**|![[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/22/attachments/679cb6079bd999e8c6c2fc4bb6239d0d_MD5.png]]|- The variable costs initially **rise proportionally with output**, as shown in the diagram<br>    <br>- At some point the firm will benefit from a **purchasing economy of scale** and the rise will no longer be proportional|
|**Total Cost (TC)**|![[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/22/attachments/c2e608ac65e5932a2665c0b0b73d0267_MD5.png]]|- The **total cost** is the sum of the variable and fixed costs<br>    <br>- The total costs **cannot be 0** as all firms have some level of fixed costs|
|**Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**|![[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/22/attachments/01ad84832e85b40836891289b71a3716_MD5.png]]|- If the **fixed costs** of a firm are $1,000 and it produces 1 unit of output, then its **AFC is $1,000** ($1,000/1)<br>    <br>- If the firm increases its output to 1000 units, then the **AFC is $1 per unit** ($1000/1,000)<br>    <br>- The **more units** a firm produces, the **lower its AFC** will be<br>    <br>- This is one reasons why large levels of output help to increase the **profit per unit**|
|**Average Total Cost (AC)**|![[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/22/attachments/75c48ad179a5ac9b521a9eb6945b5c79_MD5.png]]|- As a firm grows, it is able to increases its **scale of output** generating efficiencies that lower its **average total costs (AC)** of production<br>    <br>- These efficiencies are called **economies of scale** <br>    <br>- As a firm continues increasing its **scale of output**, it will reach a point where its **average total costs (AC)** will start to **increase**<br>    <br>- The reasons for the increase in the average costs are called **diseconomies of scale**|
