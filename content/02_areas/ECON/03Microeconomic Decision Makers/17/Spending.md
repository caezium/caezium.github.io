People spend in order to buy products to maintain their standard of living.
ex. food, clothing, housing, gas, electricity, water, transport, entertainment, and leisure.


People have income from jobs and stuff.

*But they can also earn income by*
- **interest** on savings
	- *return on capital*
- **rent**
	- leasing property
	- *return on land*
- **dividends**
	- reward for owning these shares, ex. $1000/yr, dividends are not guaranteed
	- a share of a company's profits, from shares owned in a company
	- return on enterprise
- **profit**
	- earned form running a business
	- *return on enterprise*
	- different from dividends because profit means you are running, dividends you are not



## The Influences on Spending
- Spending in an economy is also called **consumption**
- The level of consumption by households is heavily influenced by **income, interest rates and the level of confidence** in the economy

#### Shares
**IPO** Initial public offering
initial share price

#### Influences on Household Spending
Households are not able to spend all of the income they earn; they can only spend their **disposable income**

>[!def] **Disposable Income**
>the **income** earned by an individual **after** **income** **tax and other charges** such as pension contributions have been deducted

So this is the **actual amount an individual can spend** on goods and services.
This is the *single largest determinant of how much an individual spends.*


Positive relationship between the level of spending and the income earned
higher disposable income -> higher spending

lower income individuals will spend most of their disposable income on necessities to survive.

**Savings** - saved money
*Dissaving* - spending more than your income
The proportion of income which people spend is sometimes referred to as the **average propensity to consume** *(APC)* => it is calculated by dividing consumption by disposable income.

>[!def] current expenditure
>money **spent on** goods and services **consumed** **within the current year**

ex. food, clothing, entertainment


>[!def] capital expenditure
>money **spent on fixed items** owned by an individual or firm which lasts **more than 12 months**

ex. computers, cars, buildings, furniture, and equipment

### TABLE

|**Changes to Income**|**Changes to Interest Rates**|**Changes to Confidence Levels**|
|---|---|---|
|- **Disposable income** is the money that **households**have left over from their **salary/wages** after they have paid their **taxes** and have received any **transfer payments/benefits** **f**rom the government<br>    <br>- **Consumption increases**as disposable income increases and **decreases**as disposable income decreases|- **Interest rates** are set by the government's **Central Bank**<br>    <br>- Changes to the **base rate**cause commercial banks to change the **lending rates**they offer customers<br>    <br>- If **interest rates increase** then the cost of borrowing increases. Higher borrowing costs = less consumption<br>    <br>- If interest rates increase, the **monthly repayment** on any existing loan increases. Higher loan repayments = less consumption|- The stronger the economy, the higher **consumer confidence.** Consumers **feel secure** in their jobs and are confident of receiving **regular salary payments.** Thereforeconsumption increases<br>    <br>- In a weakening or **recessionary economy**, **consumer** **confidence** falls. Consumers **feel less secure** in their jobs and consumption decreases|

**Wages** - measured outcome of pay, ex. hours worked, work produced
**Salary** - same monthly operations and billable hours

#### Relationship between disposable income and consumption
At very low income levels, there is dissaving. At the point/level Z, all income is spent. Then as income rises past Y, saving occurs, expenditure continues to rise but it rises at a slower rate.

#### Pattern of Expenditure
Different income groups have different patterns of spending

lower income groups tend to have to spend a higher proportion of their income, and total expenditure, on necessities such as food and clothing.
However, the rich might spend more money on food, but that is still a smaller portion of their income and total expenditure

The rich spend more, both in total and proportion on luxury items, consumer durables, entertainment, and services.

- household composition
- tastes
- age
- country
- income group

there is a positive relationship between disposable income and consumer spending


##### Conspicuous Consumption
Conspicuous consumption is exemplified by **purchasing goods that are exclusively designed to serve as symbols of wealth**, such as luxury-brand clothing, high-tech tools, and vehicles.

---

#### Confidence Level
recession, low economic growth, inflation
feel less confident
so they spend less
they save

**recession** - period of accelerated negative growth
**inflation** - higher overall the cost of products, money is worth less

they don't know what will happen so they save more
borrow less too




---

Age - a younger person can borrow/spend more and an older person will save more


size of households
a larger size of household will usually consume more than a smaller size


availability of funds
banks and other financial institutes lend money
