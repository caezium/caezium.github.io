## The Influences on Saving
*Disposable income* can either be **saved** or **spent** on goods/services (consumption)


There are multiple forms of saving.
- *contractual*: sign a contract, agreeing to save a certain amount on a regular basis.
	- for insurance policies and pension schemes
- *non-contractual*: ex. placing money in bank and building society accounts, buying government securities, shares, and property.
	- these savings vary more with time and is heavily influenced by changes in interests than contractual saving


##### Reasons for saving
- **target saving**
	- people save to gain a particular sum of money for a particular purpose
		- ex. car, home
- retirement, children, precautionary reasons and to provide an income or capital gain.
	- when people retire, their income stops
	- more savings cna make their retirement more comfortable
- finance education or inheritance

| - When **disposable income** increases, the proportion saved depends on the overall income level of the household<br>    <br>- **Low income**households will spend any **additional income**on necessities or a few basic luxuries - little additional saving occurs<br>    <br>- **Medium income**households will increase both consumption and savings<br>    <br>- **High income**households will usually increase their savings (or asset purchases) significantly | - Changes to the **base rate**cause commercial banks to change the **savings rate** they offer customers<br>    <br>- An increase in the savings rate offered by commercial banks **incentivises households** to save more<br>    <br>- An decrease in the savings rate offered by commercial banks **disincentivises households** from saving and encourages consumption | - Households tend to save when they are **more fearful** of the future<br>    <br>- The stronger the economy, the **higher the consumer confidence** and the **lower the level** of household saving<br>    <br>- The weaker the economy, the **lower the consumer confidence** and the **higher** the level of household saving |

proportion of household disposable income saved is called **APS (average propensity to save)**
