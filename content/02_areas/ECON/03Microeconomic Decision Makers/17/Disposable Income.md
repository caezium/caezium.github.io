Households are not able to spend all of the income they earn; they can only spend their **disposable income**

>[!def] **Disposable Income**
>the **income** earned by an individual **after** **income** **tax and other charges** such as pension contributions have been deducted

So this is the **actual amount an individual can spend** on goods and services.
