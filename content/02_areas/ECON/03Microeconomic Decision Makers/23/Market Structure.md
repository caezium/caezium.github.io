## An Introduction To Competitive and Monopoly Markets

- Each firm operates in a **specific market**
    
- The conditions in different markets can **vary significantly** and are determined by the **market structure** in which the firm operates
    
- There are a range of market structures, however **your syllabus** only requires you to know the characteristics of two - **competitive markets and monopolies**
    
- Competitive markets are those with an extremely **high degree of competition**
    
- A monopoly is a market structure in which one firm dominates the market and has **significant market power**

_**The six characteristics which determine the type of market structure a firm operates in - competitive or monopoly**_

- The **answers to the questions** above determine the type of **market structure** in which a firm is operating in
    
    - If a firm is selling a unique product (e.g. handmade car) it is likely operating in a monopoly market and setting high prices
        

## Characteristics of Competitive Markets

- The characteristics of a competitive market are as follows

> [!def] Price takers
> firms that have no market power and cannot influence the price -- they take the 'going price'

> [!def] Barriers to entry
> conditions that make it difficult/expensive for a firms to enter a market to compete with existing firms, eg. high start-up costs

> [!def] Homogenus products
> products are identical and indistinguishable from each other



1. **There are many buyers and sellers:** due to the number of market participants sellers are **price takers**
    
2. **There are no** **barriers to entry** **and exit from the industry:** firms can start-up or leave the industry with relative ease which increases the level of competition
    
3. **Buyers and sellers possess perfect knowledge of prices:** this assumption presupposes perfect information e.g. if one seller lowers their price then all buyers will know about it
    
4. **The products are** **homogenous**: this means firms are unable to build brand loyalty as **perfect substitutes exist** and any price changes will result in losing customers  
    

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Competitive Markets**

| - **Lower prices:** competition causes firms to lower prices for consumers in an attempt to gain market share<br>    <br>- **Better quality:** firms innovate and continuously seek to improve their quality of their goods/services in order to become recognised in a crowded market<br>    <br>- **More choice:** more sellers equals more choice for consumers | - **Worse quality:** in a bid to lower prices, product quality may actually deteriorate over time<br>    <br>- **Too much choice:** consumers may be overwhelmed and not explore the full range of market offerings, instead sticking to what they know<br>    <br>- **Worker welfare:** the greater the competition the greater the need to cut costs, often resulting in low wages and poor working environments |

## Characteristics of Monopoly Markets

- A monopoly is a market structure in which there is a **single seller**
    
- There are no **substitute products**
    
- The firm has **complete market power** and is able to set prices and control output
    
    - This allows the firm to **maximize profit**
        
    - There is no long-run erosion of profit levels as competitors are unable to enter the industry
        
- **High barriers to entry exist**
    
    - One of the main barriers is the ability of the monopoly to **prevent any competition** from entering the market
        
        - E.g. By purchasing companies who are a potential threat, advertising expenditure to enter
            

- Many governments define a monopoly as any firm having more than 25% **market share**
    
    - Regulators act to **prevent** market share increasing beyond this level
        
    - It helps to maintain competition within the market  

- **Imperfect knowledge**

| **The Firm**    | - **Large profits** generate money for continued investment in technology and **product innovation**<br>    <br>- Market power enables the firm to increase its **global competitiveness**<br>    <br>- **Economies of scale** can increase thereby lowering the average cost<br>    <br>- **Price discrimination:** the firm can charge consumers different prices based on the different price elasticity of demand for the product e.g. peak (inelastic) and off-peak (elastic) travel on trains | - Due to a lack of competition, there is a reduced incentive to be efficient<br>    <br>- **Cross subsidization** can create inefficiencies<br>    <br>- Monopolies lead to a **misallocation of resources** as they limit supply in order to increase price<br>    <br>- Due to a lack of competition, **innovation sometimes lacks effectiveness**                                                                             |
| **Employees**   | - Large profits often result in **higher wages**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - Having only one supplier in the industry limits the opportunity to **change employers**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Consumers**   | - Product innovation due to the firm's large profits may result in a **better-quality product**<br>    <br>- **Cross subsidisation** can lower prices on some products that the firm provides<br>    <br>- **Prices may fall** If firms pass on their cost savings to consumers (due to economies of scale) in the form of lower product prices                                                                                                                                                     | - A lack of competition is likely to result in **higher prices** as **no substitute goods** are available<br>    <br>- A lack of competition may result in **no product innovation** and worse product quality over time<br>    <br>- May experience **worse customer service** as the incentive to improve it is limited<br>    <br>- Cross subsidisation is likely to **increase prices on some products** offered by the firm |
| **Suppliers**   | - **Increased sales volume** for some suppliers as they are able to supply products that are distributed nationally or internationally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | - There is less competition for their products and a monopoly often has the power to **dictate what price** they will pay to suppliers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
