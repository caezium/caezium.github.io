**Factors**

*[[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/18/Wage Factors|Wage Factors]]*    
- different types of payment
- the total pay a person receives is known as their **earnings**, this may include the basic wage, overtime pay, bonuses, and commission.
- **Wage**
	- the wages of many workers are based on a standard number of hours, (a time rate system)


*[[02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic Decision Makers/18/Non-wage Factors|Non-wage Factors]]*
people do not always choose the highest paid job on offer, they can take a range of other factors into account
- **Job Satisfaction**
	- sense of achievement: ex. teaching, nursing. can't provide that high pay but high level of job satisfaction, some jobs can be both high pay and high level of job satisfaction, ex. sport players, TV presenters, actors.
- **Type of work**
	- *most people would rather do non-manual work than manual work*
	- non manual = **physically less tiring and generally offers more mental stimulation and better paid**
	- ex. university professors, better than blacksmiths
	- some people also prefer safer work environments rather than more dangerous work
- **Working conditions**
	- pleasant surroundings? more breaks? office space?
- **Working hours**
	- number of expected hours
	- emergency staff tend to work unsociable hours
- **Holidays**
	- length of holidays
	- ex. teaching well known for its length of holidays
	- some countries sets down minimum length of holiday entitled for full-time workers
- **Pensions**
	- for post retirement
	- ex. police retire relatively early on good pensions in some countries
	- workers in the public sector generally receive more generous pensions than private sector workers
- **Fringe Benefits**
	- benefits that are not directly money
	- ex. health schemes, free meals, housing
- **Job Security**
	- don't lose your job
	- high demand for the product => less likely to be get rid of
	- civil servants can have high job security
- **Career Prospects**
	- promotions => accept lower wages at the start of their careers
- **Size of Firm**
	- bigger name => pay more, better career prospects, more benefits
	- but some may prefer smaller firms, atmosphere more friendly and more relations
- **Location**
	- people might choose an occupation that is close to their residence. 
	- less commuting time and cost



*Limiting Factors*
people would obviously like to have a job that does all the good things on the above list.
but, in practice, their choice of occupation is limited by stuff like the qualifications they have, skills they have, and experience they have, and where they live.


more occupationally mobile and more geographically mobile
the wider the choice of occupation available to them


*Opportunity Cost*
eg
give up well paid job for a job with more job satisfaction
banker to teacher
