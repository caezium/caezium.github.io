#### Why earnings of occupations change over time

##### Change in demand and supply of labor
change in demand or supply leads to change in earnings. other reasons include changes in the stage of production, bargaining power, government policies, and public opinion.

###### Demand
if demand increases, earnings are likely to rise.

Demand of labor will rise if there is an increased demand for the product
a rise in labor productivity -> higher productivity increases the return from hiring workers
a rise in the price of capital -> might be possible to substitute labor for capital

###### Supply
a decrease in the supply of labor would be expected to raise the wage rate.

a fall in labor force -> difficult to recruit workers
rise in qualifications or length of training -> reduce eligible
reduction in non-wage benefits of a job -> fewer people are willing to do it
rise in wage or non-wage benefits of other jobs -> encourages switching to another

###### Changes in the stages of production
people working in the primary sector are usually less well-paid than those who work in the secondary and tertiary sectors.
primary sector workers tend to be less skilled and have fewer qualifications => the demand for primary sector workers usually declines as an economy develops -> secondary sector increases demand -> then tertiary.
not always the case
ex. an engineer working in the oil industry is likely to earn more than a shop assistant

###### changes in bargaining power
a change in unions' bargaining power or willingness to take industrial action can affect earnings

###### changes in government policy
the pay of public sector workers is likely to rise if the government decides to expand the public sector.
others are
- raising NMW
- improve education may actually raise wages of skilled workers, as it may increase their demand more than the supply.
- immigration => easier for foreign people to live and work should increase the supply
- anti-discrimination laws -> increase career prospects and wages of disadvantaged groups
- advances in technology ->
