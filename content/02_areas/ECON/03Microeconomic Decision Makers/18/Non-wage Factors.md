- Many different **non-wage factors** influence a workers choice of occupation 

1. **Fringe benefits:** Benefits provided in addition to a normal salary - such as childcare, free lunches, gym membership, or a company car - can be significant in influencing a person's choice of occupation
    
2. **Length of training or level of education required:** The longer the time period required to study/train for a job, the fewer the number of people who seek employment in that occupation, e.g. it usually takes seven years to become a lawyer 
    
3. **Job security:** Employment contracts in different industries have different time periods attached to them. Some contracts are one to four years in length,
    
    and enjoying work is a significant part of generating job satisfaction. Workers will often change their jobs/careers so as to improve their job satisfaction 
    
4. **Career prospects:** Jobs with a defined pathway for promotion (and salary increases) are often more desirable
    
5. **Level of challenge:** Many workers step into an occupation due to the challenge of the role, e.g. firefighters
    
6. **Status:** Some jobs carry a higher recognition in society which workers find appealing, for example doctors, surgeons and lawyers
