## An Introduction to The Division of Labour and Specialisation

- Based on observations made during a visit to a pin factory, famous economist Adam Smith developed the ideas of **specialisation** and the **division of labour**
    
    - He noted that a single worker could not make more than 20 pins a day as it involved around 18 different processes, such as cutting the wire, sharpening the end, stamping the head etc.
        
    - However, if the labour was **divided up into different tasks** and workers **specialised in just that one task**, Adam Smith estimated that just 10 workers could produce 48,000 pins per day
        
- The **division of labour** is when a **task is broken up** into several component tasks
    
- This allows workers to **specialise** by focusing on one (or a few) of the components that make up the production process and thereby gain significant skill in doing it
    
    - This results in higher **output per worker** and so increases productivity
        
- **Specialisation** occurs on several different levels
    
    - On an **individual** level
        
    - On a **business** level. For example, one firm may only specialise in manufacturing drill bits for concrete work
        
    - On a **regional** level. For example, Silicon Valley has specialised in the tech industry
        
    - On a **global** level as countries seek to trade. E.g. Bangladesh specialises in textiles and exports them to the world

| **Worker**      | - Workers can acquire the **single skill** required relatively quickly<br>    <br>- Workers gain **recognition and status** for performing their skill well                                                                                                                                                                                            | - The work can be **repetitive and boring**<br>    <br>- There is limited opportunity to gain additional skills<br>    <br>- If the firm replaces **labour with capital**, the worker may find it difficult to find employment elsewhere due to their **limited skill base**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Firm**        | - **Time spent training** new workers is relatively short<br>    <br>- **Increased output** allows firms to generate more sales and profit<br>    <br>- Higher labour productivity **lowers cost/unit** for firms, which makes their goods more competitive **internationally (exports)**                                                              | - Worker **productivity** can fall due to the boredom/ decreased motivation experienced<br>    <br>- **Staff turnover** may be high as workers seek new, interesting opportunities elsewhere<br>    <br>- International trade is beneficial for the firms that **can compete** globally. However, some firms will be **unable to compete** and will go out of business<br>    <br>- **Entire industries** may close leading to **structural unemployment** |
| **Economy**     | - Increased exports can result in **economic growth**for the nation<br>    <br>- Economic growth usually leads to **higher income**and a better standard of living<br>    <br>- Income gained from exports can be used to **purchase** other goods from around the world **(imports).** This increases the **variety of goods** available in a country | - Specialisation may create **over-dependency** on other countries' resources. This may **cause problems** if conflict arises (E.g. Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas during the Ukraine crisis)<br>    <br>- Specialisation using a country's **own resources** will lead to resource depletion. Specialisation increases the r**ate of resource depletion**                                                                                       |
