### how wage prices are determined
the demand for labor
number of workers that firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate

the demand for labor is a **derived demand** this means that labor is demanded for the goods and services it produced, and not for itself. 
*rather than for the sake of just hiring people*

##### determinants of the demand for labor
**How much output they can produce**
**Price for which that output can be sold**

Supply
- Qualifications
	- 
- Special skills
	- unskilled workers are generally paid less than skilled workers
	- skilled workers produce more output and the price of their output can be higher
- Amount of training


#### Wage Determinants
- **Relative bargaining power of employers and workers**
	- higher bargaining power, higher wages
	- ex. in a trade union or professional organization
	- ex. doctors and lawyers belong to their professional organization which represents their interests, bargaining position is strengthened by the knowledge that they would be difficult to replace with other workers and any industrial action taken would have serious consequences,
	- ex. cleaners and waiters do not belong to a workers' organization, their bargaining strength is further reduced by the fact that they are usually widely dispersed and can be replaced easily
	- public sector workers are more likely to belong to a trade union: government are more willing to negotiate with trade unions than private sector employers, public sector workers might also find it easier to get together to operate as one bargaining body. But the government is in a stronger position to restrict the wage rises of its own workers and private sectors may try to find ways around legislations
- **Government Policies**
	- a government clearly influences the wages of the public sector
	- but policies also influence
	- ex. **National Minimum Wage**: a wage floor, raising the pay of low-paid workers and reduce poverty.
	- ex. if a government introduced a law requiring car drivers to take a test every ten years, demand for driving instructors would likely rise, pushing up their wages

- **Public Opinion**
	- it is in public opinion that jobs which involve long periods of study and training should be highly rewarded
	- wage claims made by workers. eg firefighters thinking that their labor is worth more than police. so it police pay rise, they want too
	- public opinion can put pressure on a government to revise the wages it pays to public sector workers. they want to gain or maintain popular support
- **Discrimination**
	- a group of workers treated unfavorably

## Factors That Influence The Demand for Labour

- The **labour market** is composed of **sellers of labour** (households) and **buyers of labour** (firms)
    
    - **Workers supply** their labour and **firms demand** labour
        
- The demand for labour is a **derived demand**
    
    - This means that **it depends on the demand for goods/services**
        
        - If demand for goods/services increases then the demand for labour will increase - and vice versa  
            

**Factors That Influence the Demand for Labour**

|**The price of the product being produced**|**The demand for the final product**|
|---|---|
|- If the **selling price** of the product**increases**, then the firm will be incentivised to supply more and the firm's **demand for labour** will increase|- As demand for labour is a **derived demand**, when an economy is booming then **demand for most goods/services will be high** - and the demand for labour will be **high**<br>    <br>- Conversely, when an economy is in a **recession** demand for most goods/services will be lower - and the **demand for labour will be lower**|
|**The ability to substitute capital (machinery) for labour**|**The productivity of labour**|
|- Firms will constantly evaluate if it will be possible and **more cost effective** to switch production from using labour to capital (machinery)<br>    <br>- If it is more cost effective, then **demand for labour will fall**|- If the **productivity** of labour increases (possibly through training) this will lower **average costs** and firms will likely demand more labour|

## Factors Influencing the Supply of Labour

- There are **numerous factors** that influence the amount of labour supplied to a **particular industry**  
    

**Factors Influencing the Supply of Labour**

| **Training period**                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Wages in other occupations**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Changes in migration policy**                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - **Long training periods** (and their cost) act as a barrier to entry and**exclude many households**from offering labour in certain markets                                                                | - **Comparative wage rates** in substitute labour markets strongly influence the supply of labour e.g. it is getting harder to recruit economics teachers as the **private sector** offers **higher wages** for their skills                                                            | - Policies that increase the **net migration rate**  increase the supply of labour to certain industries e.g. in 2022, 36% of Singapore's labour force were migrants                        |
| **Income tax levels**                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Working conditions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Trade union power**                                                                                                                                                                       |
| - At a certain level, **income taxes become a disincentive to households**offering their labour. <br>    <br>- The assumption is that **as income tax increases, labour supply decreases** - and vice versa | - The working conditions and non-wage benefits can act as strong incentive in certain industries e.g. tech companies are well known for their **laid-back work environment and wide range of benefits** e.g. on-site childcare and restaurants                                          | - **Trade unions** can increase the supply of labour to certain industries as **workers consider the benefits** of belonging to the union e.g. higher wages and a safer working environment |
| **Level of welfare benefits**                                                                                                                                                                               | **Social trends**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| - The **higher** the level of **welfare benefits**, the **lower the incentive** for low-skilled labour to offer their labour - and vice versa                                                               | - Social trends include any **major changes within society** and can influence the supply of labour to certain industries e.g. work from home during Covid resulted in **significant changes to the labour market** and not all workers returned to work when economies opened up again |                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Diagrammatic Analysis of the Labour Market

- The **labour market** is a type of **factor market**  
    
- **Factor markets** follow exactly the same rules as **product markets**
    
    - They are affected by changes to price, demand and supply
        
    - They are affected by the **price elasticity of demand and supply.**   
        
- **Labour market equilibrium** occurs where the **demand for labour (D****L****)** is equal to the **supply of labour (S****L****)**
    
    - The DL is the demand **by firms** for workers - firms **demand more** labour as the wage rate decreases which results in a downward sloping demand curve
        
    - The SL is the supply of labour **by workers -** workers **supply more** labour as the wage rate increases which results in an upward sloping supply curve
        
- Individual firms are **price takers** in the labour market as they have to accept the **wage rate** that workers are being paid in the industry
    
    - If they offer a **lower wage,** they will likely struggle to recruit workers
        
    - If they offer a **higher wage** there will be a large number of workers applying to work there

_**In the labour market for graphic designers, the equilibrium wage rate is W and the equilibrium quantity is Q. At this point the DL = SL**_

### Diagram analysis

- The market for graphic designers is in **equilibrium where D****L** **= S****L** 
    
- The **equilibrium wage** is W and the **quantity** of labour is Q
    
- There is **no excess supply** of labour
    
- There is **no excess demand** for labour
    

## Analysing the PED and PES of Labour

###   Price inelastic demand and supply

- Consider the **labour market** for NBA basketball players
    
- In 2022, _**LeBron James**_ received a salary of $45m  
    

![Wage determination in highly skilled markets is price inelastic in both supply and demand](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/06/45465_3-3-2-cie-igcse-economics-wage-determination-inelastic.png)

_**Wage determination in highly skilled markets is price inelastic in both supply and demand**_

####    Diagram analysis

- **D****L** is the demand for labour **from the basketball clubs**
    
- **S****L** is the supply of labour **by the basketball players**
    
- The **demand** for highly skilled players is very **price inelastic**
    
    - Clubs want the very best players, almost irrespective of what they **cost**
        
- The **supply** of highly skilled players is also very **price inelastic** 
    
    - A significant increase in price will have little impact on the quantity of labour supplied in the market as it takes years to develop _**LeBron James**_ type skills
        
- The **market equilibrium** is found at W1Q1 - a **high price** and relatively **low quantity**  
    

### Price elastic demand and supply   

- Consider the **labour market** for labourers on a building site  
     
    

![3-3-2-wage-determination-elastic](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2022/11/3-3-2-wage-determination-elastic.png)

#### Diagram analysis

- **D****L** is the demand for labour **from the building company for labourers**
    
- **S****L** is the supply of labour **by people willing to work on a building site**
    
- The **demand** for workers is very **price elastic**
    
    - If wages dropped a little, then firms would respond quickly by **employing more workers**
        
- The **supply** of workers is also very **price elastic** 
    
    - Due to it being an unskilled job, there would quickly be an increase in the **supply of labour** if wages were to increase
        
- The **market equilibrium** is found at W1Q1 - a **low price** and relatively **high quantity**
    

## Relative Bargaining Power

- Workers have **different degrees of bargaining power** when it comes to negotiating wage increases with their employers
    
- The following factors influence their bargaining power
    

1. **Membership of a trade union:** trade unions represent the interests of the workers in negotiations with employers and members frequently enjoy higher wages than non-union members 
    
2. **Age and experience:** young, inexperienced workers have less bargaining power then older, more experienced workers. As workers grow older their age often begins to count against them and this reduces bargaining power
    
3. **Level of education:** education provides higher levels of skill and specialisation to a worker. This increases their bargaining power relative to **unskilled workers**
    
4. **Current supply conditions:** the supply of labour in many industries can change due to socio-political conditions e.g prior to Brexit, workers in the hotel industry had very little **bargaining power**. Brexit created a shortage of labour willing to work in hotels and so the bargaining power of workers has increased, resulting in **higher wages** in the industry
    

## Government Policy: Minimum Wages

- Government's often **intervene in the labour market** by setting a minimum wage
    
    - They do this in order to **improve equity** and avoid the **exploitation** of worker
        
- A **minimum wage** is a **legally imposed wage level** that employers must pay their workers
    
    - It is set **above** the market rate
        
    - The minimum wage/hour often varies **based on age**  
        

![A national minimum wage (NMW1) is imposed above the market wage rate (We) at W1](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/06/41998_3-5-3-cie-igcse-economics-minimum-wage-edexcel-al-economics.png)

_**A national minimum wage (NMW1) is imposed above the market wage rate (We) at W1**_

### Diagram analysis

- The **market equilibrium** wage and quantity for truck drivers in the UK is seen at **W****e****Q****e**
    
- The government imposes a **national minimum wage** (NMW) at **W****1**
    
- Incentivised by higher wages, the **supply of labour increases** from Qe to Qs
    
- Facing higher production costs, the **demand for labour** by firms **decreases** from Qe to Qd
    
- This means that **at a wage rate of W****1** there is **excess supply of labour** and the potential for **unemployment** equal to **Q****d****Q****s**
