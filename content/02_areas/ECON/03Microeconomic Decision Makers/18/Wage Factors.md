**A Summary of Wage Factors That Influence Occupational Choices**

| **Factor**                        | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wages**                         | - An agreed amount of **money/hour** and is calculated directly from the number of hours worked<br>    <br>- E.g. If a student works in a restaurant for 6 hours, 5 days a week and she gets paid $10/hour, her **weekly wage** is $300 (6x5x$10)                                                         |
| **Salary**                        | - Employment contracts often state the agreed **annual salary** the employee will receive<br>    <br>- This is then divided by 12 and **paid monthly** (in the USA it is divided by 24 and paid every 2 weeks)<br>    <br>- The hours worked monthly may vary but the pay received is **always the same** |
| **Commission**                    | - Often used as payment to sales people<br>    <br>- It is typically a **percentage of the value of the transaction**involved, e.g. estate agents receive 3-7% of the selling price of any property they sell<br>    <br>- This can **motivate employees** to maximise sales                              |
| **Bonus**                         | - Money paid in **addition to a salary** and is usually single annual payment<br>    <br>- Often paid when the company earns high levels of profits, or as a **reward** for exceptional worker performance                                                                                                |
| **Piece rate pay**                | - A **fixed amount** paid to the employee for **each completed item**produced, e.g. 25 Rupees paid to workers in India for each pair of socks they produce                                                                                                                                                |
| **Performance related pay (PRP)** | - Payment based on how well the **worker performs**<br>    <br>- Workers doing exactly the **same job** may receive **different compensation** based on **different outcomes** they achieve                                                                                                               |
| **Share options**                 | - Payment through the issuing of shares in the company the employee works for<br>    <br>- This is usually in addition to a monthly salary<br>    <br>- The **monetary value** of the shares provided to the employee can be calculated on any given day as: **number of shares x share price**           |
