#### Research of Events and Details
- Tesla workers in the USA faced union struggles in 2023
- Swedish unions were stronger, supported by government and solidarity actions, while US efforts faced resistance and firings.
- ongoing strikes in Sweden with no resolution by 2025, and failed unionization in the USA.

##### Background
In **2023**, Tesla factory workers in the **USA and Sweden** attempted to **unionize**, **demanding better wages, safer working conditions, and collective bargaining.**

led to significant labor disputes
strikes in Sweden
and
firings in USA

##### Events in Sweden
- mechanics repairing Teslas went **on strike in October 2023**, demanding a **collective bargaining agreement**. 
- Tesla **refused to negotiate**
	- led by CEO Elon Musk, refused to negotiate, stating in an X post that unions "create negativity" and a "lords and peasants situation" ([Elon Musk X post](https://x.com/CNBC/status/1730264559775043910)). 
- the *Swedish government* supported the union by **banning replacement workers.** 
- led by *IF Metall*, expanded with **solidarity actions** from dockworkers, electricians, and others, **lasting at least 8 months by July 2024 and ongoing by April 2025**, 
- no clear resolution yet.
- did not affect Tesla much, only hindered license plate collection process.

##### Events in the USA
- Tesla workers **were fired for discussing unions,** 
- over **30 workers dismissed at the Buffalo facility** in February 2023, shortly after organizing efforts began. 
- **Legal battles ensued**, but unionization efforts, supported by the *United Auto Workers (UAW)*, have **not succeeded**, reflecting **weaker labor laws** and Tesla’s resistance.

##### Unexpected Detail
**An unexpected aspect is the international solidarity in Sweden**, with unions from Denmark, Norway, and Finland joining the strike, creating a broader impact on Tesla’s operations beyond Sweden.


#### Outcome
Sweden:  
The strike by IF Metall and other Swedish unions against Tesla, which began in October 2023, appears to be ongoing as of April 2025. Reports from early 2025 indicate continued legal battles and solidarity actions, with no clear resolution. This has involved multiple unions blocking services like license plate deliveries, putting pressure on Tesla to sign a collective bargaining agreement, but this did not affect Tesla much. Both sides, being both big, are unwilling to budge.

United States:  
In the US, Tesla has successfully resisted unionization efforts, still with no unions representing its workers as of now. Despite attempts by the United Auto Workers (UAW) and others since 2017, and ongoing investigations into labor practices, Tesla remains the only major American automaker without union representation.


Elon Musk, as co-chair of DOGE under President Trump, has been involved in significant government reforms, posing a threat on the government branches that chooses to go against him,  rendering the weak labor laws even more weak as most investigations and oversight have ended.

#### Strength of the Trade Unions
The strength of the trade unions varied significantly between the two countries.
- **Sweden**: The union, primarily IF Metall, appears strong due to several factors:
  - High union density, with almost 90% of the Swedish workforce covered by collective agreements
  - Solidarity actions from multiple unions, including dockworkers refusing to unload Tesla vehicles and international support, creating a broad blockade.
  - Government support, such as banning replacement workers, enhancing union leverage.
  - The strike’s persistence into 2025, despite Tesla’s legal challenges, indicates resilience, with IF Metall vowing to continue.

- **USA**: The union efforts, led by UAW, seem weaker:
  - Lower union density in the auto industry, especially for EVs, with Tesla being the only major non-union American automaker.
  - Tesla’s aggressive anti-union tactics, including firings and legal battles, with historical violations noted, such as a 2019 ruling by an administrative judge on illegal union-busting
  - Weaker labor laws, with solidarity actions like those in Sweden being illegal in the USA, limiting union power.



#### Key Players
postal workers, blocking services such as license plate deliveries and waste collection.

- **Sweden**:
  - **Trade Union**: IF Metall, leading the strike, with support from 12 other unions.
  - **Employers**: Tesla, refusing to sign agreements, with CEO Elon Musk publicly opposing unions.
  - **Employees**: Mechanics and other workers, with over 30 on strike nationwide by July 2024, showing active participation.
  - **Government**: Supportive, banning replacement workers and upholding labor rights
  - **Society**: High public support, with 90% workforce unionized

- **USA**:
  - **Trade Union**: UAW, attempting to organize, with Tesla Workers United filing complaints.
  - **Employers**: Tesla, resisting unionization, with firings and legal defenses.
  - **Employees**: Workers at Buffalo, facing retaliation, with over 30 fired in 2023.
  - **Government**: NLRB involved, with mixed outcomes, finding some violations but dismissing others
  - **Society**: Less supportive, with lower union density and legal constraints on solidarity actions.
#### Industrial Actions
The industrial actions taken highlight the strategies employed:

- **Sweden**:
  - Strikes by mechanics, starting October 2023, expanding to over 30 strikers by July 2024.
  - Solidarity blockades, with dockworkers refusing to unload vehicles, electricians and cleaners joining, as in [Musk and Tesla are battling unions across Scandinavia.

#### Overview of the Events
In 2023, Tesla workers in both the USA and Sweden sought to unionize, driven by demands for better wages and safer working conditions. The struggles manifested differently in each country, reflecting varying labor laws, union strength, and employer responses.

- **Sweden**: The conflict began in October 2023 when mechanics affiliated with IF Metall, the Swedish metalworkers' union, went on strike, demanding Tesla sign a collective bargaining agreement. 
	- Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, refused to negotiate, stating in an X post that unions "create negativity" and a "lords and peasants situation" ([Elon Musk X post](https://x.com/CNBC/status/1730264559775043910)). 
	- This refusal triggered solidarity actions from other unions, including dockworkers, electricians, postal workers, and even international support from Danish (3F Transport), Norwegian (Fellesforbundet), and Finnish (AKT) unions. 
	- The Swedish government supported the union by banning replacement workers, and by July 2024, the strike had lasted 8 months, with more than 30 employees nationwide and 7 mechanics in Malmö deserting their workbenches. 
	- As of April 2025, the strike remains ongoing with no resolution, as reported by [Tesla seeks Sweden court order in protracted labour union conflict | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeks-sweden-court-order-protracted-labour-union-conflict-2025-01-07/).
  
- **USA**: In the USA, unionization efforts were led by the United Auto Workers (UAW), with workers at Tesla’s Buffalo facility attempting to organize. 
	- However, in February 2023, Tesla fired more than 30 workers, with 18 named in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), shortly after the organizing effort was announced, as reported by [Tesla accused of firing union supporters days after organizing effort starts | CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/business/tesla-workers-fired-union/index.html). 
	- Tesla claimed the firings were due to performance, but the union, Tesla Workers United, alleged retaliation. 
	- Legal battles followed, with the NLRB finding some merit in claims of unlawful workplace rules but dismissing others, as noted in [Tesla beats US claim that it fired factory workers amid union campaign | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-beats-claim-that-it-fired-factory-workers-amid-union-campaign-2023-11-27/). 
	- By April 2025, no successful unionization has been reported, reflecting Tesla’s historical anti-union stance and weaker labor protections.

  - **Society**: Less supportive, with lower union density and legal constraints on solidarity actions.

#### Outcomes
- **Sweden**: The strike is ongoing, with no resolution reported. It seems likely that the union has achieved partial success in pressuring Tesla, given the prolonged action and international attention, but Tesla’s refusal to negotiate and legal battles, such as seeking court orders for license plates, indicate no final agreement, as per [Tesla seeks Sweden court order in protracted labour union conflict | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeks-sweden-court-order-protracted-labour-union-conflict-2025-01-07/).
  
- **USA**: The unionization effort failed, with workers fired and no successful organization by UAW. Legal battles continue, with the NLRB addressing some claims, but Tesla remains non-union, as per [Tesla and trade unions - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_and_unions).
