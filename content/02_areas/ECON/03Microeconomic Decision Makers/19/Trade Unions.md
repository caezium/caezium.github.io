>[!def] A trade union (also known as a labor union)
is an organization that exists to protect the rights of workers. protect their interests


for specific industries and specific occupations.

trade unions originated in the nineteenth century in the UK and USA
- workers often worked in very poor conditions
- trade unions were created to bargain for better terms and working environments for their members
- employers and workers have different goals
- employers
	- maximize profits
	- minimize costs
	- maximize sales
- workers
	- maximize earnings
	- work in a safe and healthy environments
	- good terms and conditions at work
	- maximize non-wage benefits too
	- have job security
- ex. an increase in wages along with a decrease in working hours will improve conditions for workers, but increase costs for employers

some national legislations are creating rules
ex. UN declaration of human rights, article 23
