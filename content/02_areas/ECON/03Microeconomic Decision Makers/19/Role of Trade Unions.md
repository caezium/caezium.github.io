#### role of trade unions

**COLLECTIVE BARGAINING**
*a sole worker is likely to have little bargaining power*

trade union representative, speaks for the whole union
negotiates on behalf of everyone, they have developed skills to do that
a collective voice is more powerful than each worker negotiating individually.
*more bargaining power*



- **bargaining** with employers
	- earnings
	- wage
	- salary
- **safety**
	- equipment
	- environments
	- legal advice
- **give support**
	- when they are redundant
	- ex. when they are between jobs
- **financial and legal support**
- persuading the government to **pass legislations**


Trade unions with higher membership tend to be more powerful

unions can also be affiliated to a large organization which negotiates with the government


#### Collective bargaining claims
- a rise in the cost of living due to **inflation**
	- *reduces the real income/wage* of trade union members
- *comparability argument*: workers in **similar/comparable occupations have more earnings**
- an **increase in the productivity** of labor
	- justifies them wanting more compensation
	- more money they work better and not stressed about stuff
- or the industry's **profits have risen and they can afford to pay higher wages**, likely because the workers contributed by productivity or other stuff


**what if it doesn't work**

##### Industrial actions
- **strikes**
	- **refuse to work**
	- impact on employers
		- output of products stopped/massively reduced
		- **instant negative impact**
		- companies cannot survive if no work for a couple of months usually
	- impact on workers
		- workers **do not get paid** when they are strikes, so they lose wages/salaries
		- **depends on how long they can strike, battling between employers and workers how long they can**
- **work to rule**
	- work to fulfill the **minimum requirements** of their job
	- impact on employers:
		- ex. bus driver drives extremely slowly
		- ex. teacher does not take part in any extracurricular activities or refuses to meet with students out of lesson time
	- impact on workers:
		- meeting their **contractual responsibilities,** *cannot be sacked or disciplined.*
- **Go slow**
	- work very slowly
	- e
		- productivity falls
		- efficiency falls
	- w
		- **morale may drop as a result of low targets and productivity.**
- **Sit in**
	- **on strike but still go**, just turn up to work but do not undertake their normal work
	- this allows **their positions not to be filled**, as they are occupying the company premises, if they do not sit in, employers might be able to find replacements. sit ins are blocking their working positions, not allow anyone to replace their positions
	- e
		- production ceases
		- **immediate impact**
	- w
		- **loss in wages**






## The Work of Trade Unions

- Workers pay a **monthly fee** to join a trade union
    
    - The fee is called a **subscription**
        
    - Their membership ends when they stop paying this fee
        
- **Benefits** of union membership include
    
    - **Collective bargaining**
        
    - Job-specific training
        
    - **Legal representation** in disputes
        
    - Discounts on a wide range of goods/services 
        
- When **collective bargaining** fails and discussions break down, trade unions have several methods of **forcing employers/governments to continue engaging** with them
    
    - These methods are collectively referred to as **industrial action** and include
        
        - **Strikes**
            
        - **Overtime bans**
            
        - **Work to rule**
            
        - **Go-slows**  
             
            

**The Focus of Trade Union Efforts** 

|**1. Collective bargaining on wages, working conditions and contractual terms**|   |
|---|---|
|- Negotiates for **acceptable wage levels** - often well above the minimum wage|- Negotiates for increased wages when **comparative industries** receive pay increases|
|- Negotiates for **inflation-linked** pay rises|- Negotiates for **higher wages** when firms are making **higher profits**|
|- Negotiates **standard weekly working hours** and any overtime payments|- Negotiates for improvements to **working conditions** and equipment|

|**2. Protecting the employment of their workers**|   |
|---|---|
|- Negotiates for the **retention and redeployment** of workers when machinery (capital) replaces labour|- Negotiates **resettlement packages** when firms relocate from one region to another and **redundancy** terms for those unable to relocate|
|- Negotiates to **minimise job losses** when machinery (capital) replaces labour|- Negotiates on a **fair termination process**when firms are struggling in an economic downturn|

|**3. Influencing government policy**|   |
|---|---|
|- Negotiates with government on the creation/maintenance of **minimum wage levels**|- Aims to influence policy through member action such as **strikes**|
|- Negotiates to **minimise job losses**when machinery (capital) replaces labour|- Negotiates on a **fair termination process** when firms are struggling in an economic downturn|

## Factors Influencing the Strength of Trade Unions

- The **higher** the percentage of workers from a firm that belong to a trade union, the **greater the collective bargaining power** of that union with the employer
    
- The higher the percentage of workers **from an economy** that belong to trade unions, the greater the collective bargaining power of the unions **with the government**
    
- There are numerous other factors which influence the **collective bargaining power** of specific unions at different periods of time

_**Factors which influence the collective bargaining power of trade unions**_

1. **The unemployment level** - the higher the unemployment level the weaker the bargaining power as firms can more easily replace existing workers
    
2. **Wage levels as proportion of total costs** - the lower the percentage of total costs that a firms's wages represent, the higher the bargaining power
    
3. **Swapping labour for capital** - the nearer the replacement cost of capital for labour to meeting the increased costs demanded by the union, the weaker the bargaining power
    
4. **The level of profits** - higher profits strengthen the unions demands for higher wages
    
5. **State of the economy** - less bargaining power in a recession and more when the economy is booming
    
6. **Overall size of the trade union** - the larger the union the stronger their bargaining power
    
7. **The productivity of labour** - if the workers are extremely productive, generating high levels of output from low levels of input, they are more valuable to the firm and the union has stronger bargaining power
