**Negotiation Strategy for Spaceboys PLC Management**

**1. Pay Increase Negotiation:**  
- **Initial Offer:** Propose a 4% pay increase. Emphasize the company's need to remain competitive in a small market and reinvest profits for sustainable growth.  
- **Concession Strategy:** If pressured, incrementally increase (e.g., 4.5% → 5%) while highlighting trade-offs. Prioritize keeping the final increase **below 7%**.  
- **Trade-Off Tactic:** Offer flexibility on the canteen refurbishment (one-time cost) to limit pay increases (recurring cost). For example:  
  - *“We can allocate £10,000 for the canteen if the pay increase remains at 5%.”*  

**2. Canteen Refurbishment:**  
- **Initial Offer:** Start at £7,500, framing it as sufficient for necessary upgrades.  
- **Concession Strategy:** If pressed, incrementally raise the offer (up to £10,000) in exchange for a lower pay increase.  

**3. Mitigating Union Actions:**  
- **Preempt “Go Slow” or “Overtime Ban”:** Settle negotiations before disruptions occur. Stress mutual interests (e.g., avoiding production delays before Christmas).  
- **Leverage Profitability Arguments:** Acknowledge the union’s concerns but link concessions to long-term job security and company stability.  

**Final Deal Target:**  
- **Ideal Outcome:** 4% pay increase + £7,500 canteen.  
- **Acceptable Compromise:** ≤6% pay increase + ≤£10,000 canteen.  
- **Key Priority:** Keep pay increases as low as possible (recurring cost impact) while using canteen funds (one-time) as a bargaining chip.

**Script Example for Negotiation:**  
As a small company in a small market, we, as the employers, have to ensure that this company remains competitive in a small market and reinvest profits for sustainable growth.
*“We value our employees and understand the need for a refreshed canteen. We’re prepared to commit £8,000 to the canteen if we can agree to a 3.5% pay increase. This balances immediate improvements with sustainable growth for everyone’s benefit.”*  
If we increase your pay by too much, all of our jobs are lost.

We do not have the budget to raise both of these by too much.
