##### Background
In **2023**, Tesla factory workers in the **USA and Sweden** attempted to **unionize**, **demanding better wages, safer working conditions, and collective bargaining.**
led to significant labor disputes

##### Events in Sweden
talk about events in the comic
- led by CEO Elon Musk, refused to negotiate, stating in an X post that unions "create negativity" and a "lords and peasants situation" ([Elon Musk X post](https://x.com/CNBC/status/1730264559775043910)). 
- no clear resolution yet.
- did not affect Tesla much, only hindered license plate collection process.

- **Positive Impacts**:
setting a precedent for labor rights in the EV industry (no exceptions)
- **Negative Impacts**:
Strikes slightly disrupted Tesla operations, leading to economic losses and affecting consumers.

The union, primarily IF Metall, appears strong due to several factors:
  - High union density, with almost 90% of the Swedish workforce covered by collective agreements
  - Solidarity actions from multiple unions
  - Government support
  - The strike’s continued persistence into 2025
  - IF Metall paying wages



##### Events in the USA
talk about events in comic
- **did not succeed**, reflecting **weaker labor laws** and Tesla’s resistance.

- **Positive Impacts**:
Raising awareness of worker rights, even in failure.
- **Negative Impacts**:
Workers faced job loss and legal battles, impacting livelihoods

The union efforts, led by UAW, seem weaker:
  - Lower union density in the auto industry, especially for EVs, with Tesla being the only major non-union American automaker.
  - Tesla’s aggressive anti-union tactics, including firings and legal battles
  - Weaker labor laws

##### Unexpected Detail
**An unexpected aspect is the international solidarity in Sweden**, with unions from Denmark, Norway, and Finland joining the strike, creating a broader impact on Tesla’s operations beyond Sweden.


#### Outcome
Sweden:  
The strike by IF Metall and other Swedish unions against Tesla, which began in October 2023, appears to be ongoing as of April 2025. Reports from early 2025 indicate continued legal battles and solidarity actions, with no clear resolution. This has involved multiple unions blocking services like license plate deliveries, putting pressure on Tesla to sign a collective bargaining agreement, but this did not affect Tesla much. Both sides, being both big, are unwilling to budge.

United States:  
In the US, Tesla has successfully resisted unionization efforts, still with no unions representing its workers as of now. Despite attempts by the United Auto Workers (UAW) and others since 2017, and ongoing investigations into labor practices, Tesla remains the only major American automaker without union representation.


Elon Musk, as co-chair of DOGE under President Trump, has been involved in significant government reforms, posing a threat on the government branches that chooses to go against him,  rendering the weak labor laws even more weak as most investigations and oversight have ended.
