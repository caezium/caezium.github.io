demand for any factor of production
is of
**derived demand**
*-demanded for the sake of producing the goods and services it is used for, not for itself.*

in addition to its derived demand, there are also other factors
**quantity/availability**
greater the availability, the lower their costs tend to be, hence the higher their demand.

**costs of them**

**productivity of those factors**
better the quality, higher the demand


---


- The demand **by firms** for **factors of production (FoP)** is influenced by three factors
    

1. The demand for goods/services
    
2. The price of different factors of production
    
3. The availability and productivity of the factors
    
  

![Two supply and demand graphs for tyres and rubber. Both show demand increasing from D1 to D2, prices rising from P1 to P2, and quantities from Q1 to Q2.](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=3840/https://cdn.savemyexams.com/uploads/2024/06/15835_3-6-1-cie-igcse-economics-demand-for-factors-of-production.png)

_**The demand for rubber is derived demand from the demand for tyres**_

- In the _tyre market_, the **increased demand** for tyres is represented by a **shift in the demand curve** from D1 to D2 
    
- Rubber is a **natural resource (land)** and there is now increased demand from the firm for rubber in order to meet higher levels of tyre production
    
- The diagram on the right represents the _rubber market_ where **demand for it increases from D****1** **to D****2**
    

### 2. The price for different factors of production 

- The price of **alternative factors of production** are constantly monitored by firms in order to ensure that they are maximising **profits**
    
    - The price of **alternative (substitute)** raw materials will be considered e.g. using fish leather instead of cow leather to manufacture jackets
        
    - The price of installing **new and efficient machinery (capital)** will be monitored against the cost of hiring more **workers (labour)** 
        

### 3. The availability and productivity of the factors

- The availability of the factors of production can change rapidly in **factor markets**
    
    - Covid 19 caused many **supply issues** which reduced the availability of **labour and many raw materials**
        
    - Many firms responded by searching for **substitute factors of production** so that they could continue producing goods/services
        
    - In some cases this meant **switching demand** from cheaper **foreign imports** to more expensive **locally produced** raw materials
        
- If the **productivity** of a factor is high (or increasing), then the demand for that factor will also increase
    
    - If a new Government training scheme improves the **productivity of car mechanics,** car repair garages will seek to **employ more workers** as each worker is able to achieve more resulting in **higher profits**
