>[!def] productivity
> a measure of how well resources are used in the production process - economic efficiency in the use of land, labor, capital, and enterprise


>[!def] production
>the total output of goods and services in the production process


higher productivity = economies of scale = cost saving benefits that can also be passed onto the consumers

Higher profit = reinvest into the firm
Higher wages = more productive workers

Improved competitiveness - productive firms are more efficient and so can compete more effectively on a global scale

Economic growth - productivity is a source of economic growth it increases the production capacity, therefore shifting the PPC outwards.
### Influences on Productivity
- **Investment** is the expenditure on physical capital 
	- eg. investment in the latest technologies generally helps workers do their job better
	- higher the interest rate, the more expensive capital expenditure is.
- **Innovation**
	- commercialization of new ideas and products. could also be like R&D departments in their own firms building something to increase productivity. eg. mcdonalds with their workplace configuration allowing fast traversal of resources to be cooked and then sold
	- eg computers and phones transformed the way many people work, increases the speed of work, communication
- **Skills** and **experience**
	- productivity of labor depends on the quantity and quality of labor, so quality can be improved by this
- **Entrepreneurial spirit**
	- take risks in the production process in the pursuit of process
	- they plan and organize the various factors of production
	- willingness and ability to exploit a new business opportunity
- **Competition**
	- rivalry creates an incentive for firms to be more productive



---
- The terms **production and productivity** are fundamentally different
    
- **Production** is the act of **adding value** to the factors of production to create goods/services e.g. using tomatoes and basil to create a soup
    - It is the process of **factor conversion** into goods/services
    - It is a **measure of output** e.g. 3 cans of soup
        
- **Productivity** is a **measure of efficiency** that calculates the amount of **outputs produced per unit of input**
    - It calculates **how efficiently** resources are being used in the creation of goods/services and provides a metric for comparison e.g. after training workers proved to be 27% more efficient in their productivity
    - It is a **measure of efficiency** e.g. 3 cans produced per worker 
        

## Influences on Production
- Production is often influenced by the **state of the economy**
    - During a **recession** production falls
    - During a boom period, production increases
- As production is **dependent on the demand** for goods/services, any change to any of the **conditions of demand** will result in changes to production
- As production is also **dependent on the supply** of the factors of production, any change to any of the **conditions of supply** will result in changes to production
    
## Influences on Productivity
- **Higher productivity** is important for a firm and economy for the following reasons
1. It lowers costs and improves a firms national and international **ability to compete**
2. It allows firms to **produce more output** with the same input which puts it in a position to generate increased **economies of scale**
3. Firms can generate higher profits
4. Higher profits may mean that the firms can **pay their workers more**
5. Higher profits may mean that the **government revenue** from **corporation tax** will increase
6. An improved ability to compete in international markets will help to generate **economic growth**
    

**The Influences on Productivity Growth**

| **Influence**               | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Innovation**              | - **Process innovation** occurs when systems or manufacturing processes are improved resulting in increased efficiency e.g. Ford created the first moving production line for motor vehicle manufacturing<br>    <br>- **Product innovation** occurs when a new product emerges that does things better/faster e.g. driver free cars may transform the taxi industry and lower taxi fares                                                                                                          |
| **Investment**              | - When the **expenditure on capital** (machinery, building etc.) increases, workers are usually able to perform their jobs more efficiently resulting in higher output<br>    <br>- If firms hold back investment for long periods of time, their **capital (machinery)** degrades possibly making it harder for workers to do their jobs<br>    <br>- The **interest rates** in an economy are one of the main determinants of investment by firms. Low rates encourage investment and vice versa |
| **Training**                | - Any form of **training** (on the job, degree, diploma etc) improves the skill level of labour usually resulting in an ability to do the job better/quicker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Competition**             | - **Competition** between rival firms ensures that productivity improvements continue to occur as the firms are seeking to **'win' market share** from each other<br>    <br>- Some industries which are dominated by a **monopoly** lack competition and it is possible for those firms to become inefficient and to have low levels of productivity                                                                                                                                              |
| **Entrepreneurial freedom** | - Economies which **encourage small business** and make it easy for firms to start up and compete, ensure that there is a healthy level of competition leading to **productivity improvements**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
