### Labor-intensive and capital-intensive production
- Labour-intensive means that the **proportion of labour costs are higher** than the other factors of production, including machinery  
    
- Capital-intensive means that the **proportion of machinery costs are higher** than any of the other factors of production, including labour


Some stuff requires more labor and capital factors of production rather than the others, so they are labor-intensive and capital-intensive production
ex a school
ex. a architectural firm is labor-intensive

Labor-intensive production tend to be used to produce individual or personalized products. can be very expensive in total
Labor costs refer to all the stuff paid to the worker, like maybe taxes and other benefits, insurance


capital-intensive production could potentially have huge technical economies of scale later in the long run.


#### Choosing between these two production
depends on 
- the firm's objectives
	- profit maximizers operating in mass markets tend opt for capital-intensive production in order to minimize their unit costs of production, others might go for labor-intensive because they are operating small scale
- cost of labor compared to capital
	- if labor costs are comparably high, they might opt for capital-intensive
- the size of the market
	- labor-intensive can be for more personalized markets, while capital-intensive production can be for mass-market products
	- eg a customized suit labor will sell a more personalized and higher quality suit
	- labor can also be more flexible, responding better to changes but labor can be more expensive to find professionals that give high quality output

**The Advantages and Disadvantages of Labour-Intensive Production**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|- The firm can **adjust the number of workers**hired as demand for its goods/services fluctuate<br>    <br>- Depending on the industry, workers can build **meaningful connections** with customers which helps to create customer loyalty e.g. restaurant waiters versus iPad ordering<br>    <br>- Workers can **generate new ideas** and offer suggestions on how processes can be improved|- There may be periods where worker **productivity** is low<br>    <br>- The firm may find it difficult to **recruit workers** when needed and letting go of staff when they are not required is unpopular<br>    <br>- The more skilled the labour required, the higher the **wage bill** for the firm will be<br>    <br>- Each worker requires both **wage and non-wage benefits**, which can prove expensive for the firm<br>    <br>- Workers can get ill and then are **unavailable for work**|

| - **Production can continue 24/7** with only short breaks so as to allow for machinery maintenance<br>    <br>- Machinery cuts down on human error and **product quality** remains consistent<br>    <br>- Absenteeism or a shortage of skilled workers are non issues with **capital-intensive production**<br>    <br>- The firm can reduce average costs as it benefits from **technical economies of scale** | - The cost of purchasing and installing new machinery can be very high (but is often financed with a bank loan and paid off over a period of years)<br>    <br>- Most **machinery cannot improve processes**, although artificial intelligence innovation is changing this<br>    <br>- Switching **capital for labour** negatively impacts both the workers who lose their job and also the **morale** of the workers left behind<br>    <br>- Once the machinery is installed, it can be difficult for the firm to respond to **changing customer tastes/fashions** which require product changes |
