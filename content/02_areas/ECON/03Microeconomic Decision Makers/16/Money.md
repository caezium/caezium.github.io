| - Without money, it becomes necessary for buyers and sellers to **barter (exchange goods)**<br>    <br>- Bartering is problematic as it requires two people to want each other's goods **(double co-incidence of wants)**<br>    <br>- Money easily facilitates the **exchange** of goods as no double co-incidence of wants is necessary | - Money provides a means of **ascribing value** to different goods and services<br>    <br>- Knowing the price of a good in terms of money allows both consumers and producers **to make decisions** in their best interests<br>    <br>- Without this measure it is difficult for buyers and sellers to arrange an **agreeable exchange** | - Money **holds its value** over time (of course **inflation**means that is not always true!)<br>    <br>- This means that money **can be saved**<br>    <br>- It remains **valuable in exchange** | - Money is an acceptable way to **arrange terms of credit** (loans) and to settle any **future debts**<br>    <br>- This allows producers and consumers to acquire goods in the **present**and pay for them in the **future** |








## The Characteristics of Money

- Many items were used for centuries as a **form of money** such as gold, silver, shells, beer, tobacco
- However, each one of these items had some **characteristics** that made the less than ideal for exchange in certain circumstances
- **Good money** has a number of **essential characteristics** - and modern currency fulfils them all

#### The six characteristics of good money

1. **Divisibility:** to be a valued medium of exchange, currency must be **divisible**. €50 notes can be exchanged for €10 euro notes or €1 coins.
	1. ex. before, a cow cannot be divided into multiple parts to be easily used for trade
2. **Acceptability:** the currency must be valued and widely accepted by society as a **valid way to pay** for goods/services
3. **Durability:** the currency must be robust, not easily defaced/destroyed and last for a long period of time
4. **Scarcity:** the supply of the currency should be such that **remains desirable** and retains its value in the market. Oversupply would decrease its worth
5. **Uniformity:** in order to be a **valid measure of value** each denomination must be exactly the same e.g. every $50 note must be exactly the sam
6. **Portability:** good currency is easy to carry/conceal
