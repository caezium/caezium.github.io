#### Commercial banking
Banking is a major industry in a number of countries, it helps people to borrow and lend and carry out a range of other financial activities.

they are also called retail or high street banks. 
- Commercial indicates that they are a business to make profit, 
- retail suggests that they are selling,
- high street suggests that these banks are found in most towns and cities, these are the banks we are most familiar with.

##### The main functions of commercial banks
- **accept deposits**
	- deposits can be made into two types of accounts, one is a current account (also called demand account or sight account). There is easy and immediate access to money in this type of account, but usually interest is not paid on money held in such an account. Customers use current accounts mainly to receive and make payments
	- The other type of account is a deposit or time account, a period of notice has to be given before money can be withdrawn from this account. Interest is paid on any money held in a deposit account and customers use deposit accounts as a way of saving.
- **lend money**
	- there are two main ways of borrowing money from a bank, one is in the form of an overdraft, this enables a customer to spend more than what is in her or his account, up to an agreed limit. Interest is charged on the amount borrowed. This can be relatively expensive way of borrowing and is mainly used to cover short-term gaps between expenses and income.
	- The other way of borrowing is by taking a loan. This is usually for a particular purpose and for a particular period of time, interest is charged on the full amount of the loan but the rate of interest is likely to be lower than that on an overdraft.
	- A customer may be asked to provide some form of security, known as collateral, when taking a loan. This is to ensure that if the loan is not repaid, the assets given as collateral can be sold and the money recovered.
	- In practice, banks tend to try and not do this by checking very carefully whether the person seeking a loan will be able to repay it. In the case of a firm, this is likely to involve a scrutiny of the firm's accounts and business plan.
- **enable customers to make payments**
	- receive and make payments, acting as agents for payments and providing money transmission services, like credit cards, direct debits, debit cards, and online banking
- **other functions**
	- exchange foreign currency
	- leave important documents
	- lock boxes
	- administration of wills
	- financial matters ex. tax forms, purchase and sales of shares.
the first two functions are essentially the bank acting as financial intermediaries. They channel money from lenders to borrowers.

the key aim of a commercial bank is to **make profit for its shareholders, which is by giving loans/advances**. Another aim which can conflict with this key aim is what is known as **liquidity**. Banks have to ensure that they can **meet with their customer's requests to withdraw money**. So, they have to keep a certain amount of what are called liquid assets, which can be turned into **cash quickly and without incurring loss.**

##### Independence of central banks
A number of governments have *given their central banks the authority to decide the rate of interest and a inflation target.*

If they think there is a danger that the price level will *increase more than the target*, it is likely to *raise the rate of interest*, if they think it will *fall below the target,* it is likely to *lower the rate of interest.*

A central bank is tempted to lower the rate of interest to win public support.
