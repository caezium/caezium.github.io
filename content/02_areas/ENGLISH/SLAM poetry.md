this is not poetry 


Everyone says that the world should not have the impoverished
SDG goal number one, I wish that they actually thought of a plan
being number one
is going to be the hardest to solve
but now elons out there tweeting 100 times a day on his social media company
swearing to do good on DOGE without a conflict of interest
then gets a contract for 400 million
high on shrooms and lsd
admits with no consequence
creates 13 children with no father figure
i guess they do but a
parasocial father figure

oh then theres trump coin, for the ones that believe
a meme for people but a con for the believers

why they broke
lets spit the truth
some were bron bad, no ladder to climb, just crap
parents ODd rent spikes, lifes a slap 
and its just crap

but wait
some dig theri own grave
slowly blead
and dont show
only tell
swipe down just one more
instand dopamine i blieve everyone cnat
ignore

no poverty chants the un
while the rich stacks stack on stack
doge moons
trump coins flop
capitalism is real
and some of it is deserved

no poverty means communism which the
nukes from us wont permit
no poverty sounds nice
and i wont pretend i know how
the roots grow deep
