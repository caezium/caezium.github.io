"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood" immediately paints a picture of an autumn setting. This use of imagery evokes a sense of the passage of time, setting off and enhancing the theme of choices and their effect after you make them.

Symbolism
The "two roads" in "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood" symbolize life choices, representing how going down a different path might be totally different and the divergent paths that one faces in life. The decision to go down one over the other reflects the significance of the choices one make and how they shape one's future.


Mood
The mood presented in "I shall be telling this with a sigh" is one of reflection and contemplation as the speaker reflects on their choice with a 'sigh', whether relief or regret. This contributes to the overall reflective and bittersweet tone of the poem, promoting thinking and reflection of ones choices and their consequences.

contrast - complexity of decisions may not be what they initially seem
Juxtaposition
"Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same"
This line creates a juxtaposition between the initial perception of the two roads as being different and the realization after observing them that they are similar. This highlights the ambiguity, uncertainty, and unpredictability of choices.

Ambiguity
The author reflects at the end and comes up that his choice "has made all the difference". We do not know whether that difference is good or bad. This reinforces the theme of uncertainty of choices and their consequences.


First Person POV
"I took the one less traveled by"
This makes the poem more personal to the author and intimate with their experience. Allowing the speaker to reflect and adding their thought process and individual responsibility of the decisions made.
