before young love was great

many words relate to path
down the path of marriage - not the same

marriage without 'rude reason' cannot be escaped 
people have to get married
rude reason is like maybe an important job that can get you killed so no marry to not hurt

nolstalgia
time
aging and loss
love 
*landscape and human experience* can be used for comparison essay
the significance of place and memories




Thomas Hardy met his first wife, Emma Gifford, while he was working as an architect on St. Juliot's church, just outside Boscastle on the North Cornwall Coast. They were married in 1874 and she died in 1912. Hardy wrote several poems about their first meeting and about their marriage, most of these poems were written in the years immediately after her death. In the poems, Hardy disguises some place names as was his habit, although others remain as they were. St. Juliot and Beeny Cliff are real places near Boscastle. Castle Boterel refers to Boscastle itself, while Lyonesse is the name of the mythical land of ancient Cornwall. I have included four of Hardy's poems on this page, all of which relate Cornwall with Emma Gifford in some way, although he also wrote many poems that refer to Cornwall in other ways.
