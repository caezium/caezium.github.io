you look around, you hear a tie tighten somewhere, a mug being gripped, and then a gentle sip.

everyone glanced up, looking at you, no warm welcome was needed, you were already welcomed at orientation. their glance was the type where they looked at you directly, made sure you know that they looked, then the glance steadied for just long enough to let you know. To let me know what? 

they say that the view gets better up here

6 figures, i earned this, 6 figures, i deserve this, i spent all this time learning, 6 figures.

Lives lost, profits gained

His highlighter's tip wobbled, then followed the upper part of the body, the highlighter slipped, but his hand followed too in a tight grip. Streaking yellow across the desk, his eyes did not waver though, it stayed fixed on his screen, as if it drained his face pale. Fixed. You hear a highlighter being dropped onto the floor. Fixed. He then, not suddenly, but slowly, started turning clockwise, head followed by shoulder. What was he turning for. The ominous turn lasted for 4 seconds. He turned, and say nothing behind him but the blank wall. His body sagged and he turned back to his screen.

### The Ledger

This is your first day at Kessler, Hargrove & Tate. Welcome aboard. You’re a legal assistant now, fresh meat for the billable grind. That’s your desk, third cubicle from the window—frosted glass, ergonomic chair, a monitor that hums faintly when you boot it up. The office gleams: polished steel, white walls, LED lights that buzz like a hive if you listen too long.  **Everyday, the air will feel thick by 5 p.m. You’ll get used to it. Or you won’t.**

Here’s the drill: clock in by 7 a.m. You will be tracked. Don't give them ammo for your review. **Your will come in 50 hours a week, minimum, but aim for 60 if you want a bonus.** You will not be paid for overtime. You will keep your calendar public. **You will not pick up the phone if it rings after 6 p.m., let it roll to voicemail. The voice on the other end isn’t HR, and it’s not your problem. Yet.**

**That’s Clara’s cube next to yours. She’s been here six years, no law degree, just a knack for sniffing out weak spots in deposition transcripts.** S**he’s good—too good, maybe. She won't advance any further than this though** Last month, she flagged a plaintiff’s tax filings that killed a $12 million suit. “Creative discovery,” she called it, but her hands shook when she handed me the printout. She keeps a rosary taped under her desk drawer. Doesn’t touch it anymore. **If she offers you coffee, say no—it’s lukewarm and bitter.**

Over there’s the mailroom. **That’s Eddie sorting briefs, hunched over a cart stacked with FedEx envelopes. Thirty-two years here. **He hums hymns while he works, low and mournful, like something you’d hear over a grave.** **Don’t ask about his limp. Non-disclosure agreement. **

This glass office is Miles Tanner’s. Junior partner, thirty-four, already thinning up top. **He billed 3,200 hours last year—eighty a week, no holidays. Lost his fiancée over it;** **He’ll flash you a smile, all teeth, but his eyes stay flat, like he’s sizing you up for a deposition.** **** You will do what he asks when he asks, you will shred if he asks you to shred. **** 

Upstairs is the senior suite. That’s where Victor Hargrove holds court. Armani suit, a walking American Psycho reboot. He’s the kind of guy who’d kill you with a pen and bill the client for the cleanup. **Last week, he spent three hours berating a first-year associate over a misplaced comma in a brief—voice calm, eyes gleaming.** He’s got a corner office with a view of the skyline, blackout shades always half-drawn. You will see that the view gets better up from here. 

**The firm’s not old, not really. The building’s LEED-certified, retrofitted in 2018—motion-sensor lights, recycled carpet, the works. But it feels heavy, doesn’t it? Like the walls are watching, tallying your hours, your typos, your bathroom breaks. The vents are breathing and the Christmas baskets are watching.** Won the case, lost two rivers. The client’s still with us—sends a Christmas basket every year, stuffed with truffles and a card that says, “To loyalty.” Hargrove keeps it on his desk like a trophy. You will feel someone watching, some chain-rattling specter, weight of deals signed in blood, clients who don’t care who gets crushed as long as the motions are filed on time.

Your first task is simple. See that black ledger on the third shelf? **Log this entry: Case 87-12, February 21, 2025, your initials.** **It’s a pro bono file**, technically, but no one talks about it. Don’t ask why—just write the date and sign. Quick, now—Miles is watching from his perch.
**Wait. You’re flipping back, aren’t you? Saw something. Your name, there, ten years ago—2015. Same initials, same block print.** Typo, probably. Happens when you’re tired, rushing to meet a deadline. T**he ledger’s old, sure, but not that old—rebound every decade, fresh paper. Still, it’s odd. I’d laugh it off, but Clara’s staring at you now, her pen frozen mid-sentence.** Eddie’s humming louder. Ignore it. Close the book. Move on.

After a while here, you hear the real ghosts, whispering through wired transfers and NDAs, they will haunt you...

**That’s the civil war here: not screaming matches, but papercuts. A paralegal hoards a key exhibit, stalling a junior’s deadline. A mailroom guy “loses” discovery docs to settle a grudge. Clara’s after Miles’s office; Miles is eyeing Hargrove’s throne. Hargrove just watches, amused, like a vulture circling a battlefield. You? You’re cannon fodder till you prove otherwise.**

So pace yourself. Too fast, and they’ll bury you in motions to draft—Hargrove loves a workhorse. Too slow, and you’re out, replaced by next week’s hire. Watch the ladder, but don’t climb blind. Eddie’s trapped, Clara’s fraying, Miles is fading, and Hargrove’s a psychopath with a corner office. The firm’s not crumbling—not yet—but it’s rotting from the inside, one billable hour at a time. **That’s my desk over there. I’ve been here twelve years, too long to leave, too short to matter. Finish that entry. The clock’s ticking.**

#### draft two

**Rain lashes the windows today, February 24, 2025**, a gray curtain blurring the skyline beyond Kessler, Hargrove & Tate’s glass tower. **The drops drum against the panes like fingers tapping an impatient rhythm, and the wind howls low,** **a moan that seeps through the seals.** I sit at my desk, third cubicle from the window, the same one they gave me three days ago on orientation. The file in front of me—Case 19-45—stinks: a partner’s signature on the dotted line. My pen hovers over the page, and I can’t shake the memory of that first day, the way the air felt too thick, the way the firm’s ghosts whispered louder than I knew.

I nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge’s gavel mid-ruling. She walked me past the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high with FedEx envelopes, and his hymn floated up—*“dust to dust”*—a dirge that clung to the walls. His shadow stretched long, bent at the knee where it shouldn’t, and I wondered then if the firm had snapped him like a twig underfoot.

Clara’s cube came next. Her fingers danced over the keyboard, unearthing dirt from a plaintiff’s 1099s, a smirk tugging her lips as she typed. But her hands trembled, spilling coffee onto a blotter stained with older stains. She offered me a cup later, the mug warm but the brew cold, and I saw the shadows pooling under her eyes—ghosts of cases she’d bent till they broke. Down the hall, Miles Tanner’s glass office glowed like a lantern in fog. He leaned back in his chair, tie loose, grinning. His reflection in the glass looked thinner, fading, a man dissolving into his own ambition. 

Then the senior suite, upstairs. Victor Hargrove’s door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine’s edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief’s misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm’s gothic prince: a Bateman born of boardrooms, thriving on the kill. I glimpsed his desk—a Christmas basket, truffles spilling out, a card pinned beneath: *“To loyalty.”* The chemical client’s ghost, I’d learn later, a specter from the ’80s benzene case.

The building wasn’t old—not really. But it breathed, didn’t it? The vents sighed like a dying man’s rattle, the walls loomed close, tallying every keystroke. There was a ladder, rungs slick with sweat and ink of misdeeds, I already felt it then, the ladder rising before me. Eddie toiled at its base, a gargoyle chained to his cart, humming hymns to ward off the inevitable. Clara clawed upward, her long nails leaving gouges in Miles’s shadow—he stumbled mid-step, his hours a noose tightening with every late night. Hargrove perched at the peak, a raven feasting on the carrion of lesser men, his throne unassailable yet trembling under the client’s unseen hand. You think its real, the same ladder was everywhere in the firm.

“Your first task,” she said, handing me a black ledger, its leather cool as a crypt slab. “Case 87-12, February 21, 2025. Date it, initial it, third shelf.” And there—ten years back, 2015—my name stared up, initials mirrored in block print. My breath caught; the pen slipped. “Typo,” she said, too quick, but Eddie’s hymn swelled, Clara’s chair squeaked still. You shrugged it off, hell, it was 6 figures anyways, and just a coincidence.

You finished your orientation. She left me there, her voice trailing off: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”

Whispers and shadows. The ladder swayed, rungs cracking, and I stood at the bottom, staring up at a spire lost in fog.

The ghosts are louder, their whispers curling through the vents: *Sign it. Bury it. Bill it.* I see Eddie’s cart rattling past, his dreams buried within the documents; Clara’s rosary swinging, like a grandfather clock; Miles’s grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove’s laugh echoes down, sharp as a blade, and the ledger’s shadow stretches long, my name carved in its depths. The firm’s not crumbling.

#### third draft

**Rain streaked the windows like tears on a mourner's face, blurring the skyline beyond Kessler, Hargrove & Tate's glass tower.** The sense of foreboding that clung to the air. The wind's mournful cry echoing the despair gnawing at me. Three days ago, I'd walked into this office with a crisp keycard and a stomach full of ambition. Now, the weight of Case 19-45 sat on my desk, its pages heavy with compromise: a client's tax evasion buried in shell companies, a partner's signature sealing the lie. My pen hovered, trembling under its sheer heaviness.

**Fifth floor, east wing, paralegal row. My desk waited, chair angled just so, monitor humming awake like it'd been expecting me. Clara sat nearby, shoulders tense, eyes fixed on a deposition transcript. Her fingers struck the keys with furious intensity, the scratching sound echoing in the quiet office.** She didn't glance my way, but I noticed the rosary beads wrapped around her wrist, the cross swaying with each movement—a ward against some unseen evil or a plea for forgiveness. Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen with a worried frown. **Her voice was weary even from afar, but there was steel in her gaze despite its cracks.**

The senior paralegal led me through the motions, her voice flat as a courtroom transcript. "Clock in by 7:45," she said, nodding to the keycard scanner blinking red on the wall. "Partners track the logs. Billable target's 1,800 hours—40 a week if you want a pulse come bonus season." **I nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge's gavel. She walked me past the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high with FedEx envelopes, and he hummed a mournful tune—"dust to dust"—a dirge that clung to the walls. His limp was more pronounced today, and I remembered the rumors: a brilliant lawyer, fallen from grace, his career shattered by a single mistake.** Now, he was a ghost haunting the halls, a cautionary tale. As he passed, he caught my eye and gave a small, bitter smile, his fingers drumming on the cart's handle—a nervous habit, perhaps, or a remnant of the man he'd been.

Down the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, tie loose, eyes bloodshot. He stared at his screen, fingers stained with highlighter ink. "I can't do this anymore," he muttered as I passed. "The client's guilty, and we're supposed to make it go away. But at what cost?" His words hung in the air, a challenge to the firm's ethics, and I felt them settle in my chest like a stone. Later, over coffee in the break room, he leaned in, his voice low. "I used to think this was the dream, you know? Big firm, big cases. But now? I'm drowning." He rubbed his eyes, and I noticed the tremor in his hands, the weight of his disillusionment.

Then, the senior suite. Victor Hargrove's door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine's edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief's misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm's gothic prince: a predator born of boardrooms, thriving on the kill. His desk held a Christmas basket, truffles spilling out, a card pinned beneath: *"To loyalty."* The chemical client's ghost, I'd learn later, a specter from the '80s benzene case, still feeding the firm's veins with dirty gold.

The office was a labyrinth of cubicles, each a tiny prison cell where dreams went to die. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly glow on the workers' faces. The air was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and broken promises, a constant reminder of the compromises made in the name of success. Though the building was new—LEED-certified, retrofitted, all sharp edges and recycled air—it breathed, didn't it? The vents shuddered with each gust, exhaling a stale chill that brushed my skin like a sigh. The Kessler legacy hung thick: profit carved from flesh, a cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts. The once-pristine carpets were now stained with coffee spills, the walls marred by scuffs and scratches, each mark a testament to the firm's moral decay.

As I turned back to my desk, I caught a glimpse of movement in the window's reflection—a tall, shadowy figure standing in my cubicle's doorway. But when I spun around, there was nothing. My heart raced, and I wondered if the stress was finally getting to me. Yet, the presence lingered, a whisper at the edge of my mind, watching. Later, in the break room, I felt it again—a cold draft, a flicker in the corner of my vision. I turned, but the room was empty, save for the hum of the vending machine. The shadow appeared at odd moments: in the elevator, its reflection in the polished steel; in the hallway, a fleeting glimpse as I passed a darkened office. Each time, it vanished when I looked directly, leaving only a chill and a sense of being watched.

"Your first task," the senior paralegal said, handing me a black binder, its leather cool as a crypt slab. "Case 87-12, February 21, 2025. Date it, initial it, third shelf." I opened it, and a faint scent of damp earth wafted up, like something long buried. The pages were yellowed, the ink faded, but the dates were impossible—cases from decades ago, names I didn't recognize. I shut it quickly, filed it, but the shadow in my periphery deepened, and Eddie's hymn swelled, a warning.

That was orientation. She left me there, her voice trailing off: "Pace yourself. The clock's ticking." I didn't see it then—the war beneath the surface. Clara slipped a memo to Hargrove, cc'ing Miles's latest flub—a motion filed late, a client's ire stoked. Miles retaliated, hoarding a key exhibit till Clara's deadline bled out. Eddie "misplaced" a junior's discovery packet, his limp heavier that day, a grudge settled in silence. The ladder swayed, rungs cracking under their quiet sieges, and I stood at the bottom, staring up at a spire lost in fog.

Now, three days later, the rain hammered on. Case 19-45 sat open: a client's shell game, millions shuffled offshore, Hargrove's scrawl green-lighting it. My pen trembled over the non-disclosure, ink pooling like blood. The shadow flickered again, closer now, and I felt its gaze—cold, insistent. I saw Eddie's cart rattle past, a hearse for his dreams; Clara's rosary swinging, a noose she wouldn't wear; Miles's grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove's laugh echoed down, sharp as a blade, and the binder's weight tugged like a summons from below.

Then, the assignment came: destroy the evidence for Case 19-45. A single document, a loose thread that could unravel the client's lies. The partners made it clear—shred it, and the case goes away. My career climbs another rung. But as I reached for the shredder, the shadow solidified, its form almost tangible, a silent accusation. I thought of Clara, working late to support her family; of Eddie, his dreams shattered by the firm's ruthlessness; of Miles, his conscience eroded by daily compromises. And I knew I couldn't do it.

With a steady hand, I picked up the document and walked to Hargrove's office. The shadow followed, a whisper of approval or warning—I couldn't tell. Hargrove looked up, his smile thinning. "Problem?" he asked, voice like ice. I laid the document on his desk. "This stays," I said. "I won't bury it."

His eyes narrowed, but I turned and walked out, the shadow dissolving behind me. The rain had stopped, and a sliver of sunlight broke through the clouds. I took a deep breath, the air fresh and clean. Behind me, the glass tower loomed, but it no longer felt like a prison. I had made my choice, and though the path ahead was uncertain, I knew it was the right one. The ghosts of Kessler, Hargrove & Tate would haunt me no more.

As an IGCSE English teacher, I’ll evaluate this gothic story based on two criteria: how well it embodies the gothic genre and its overall quality as a narrative. I’ll assign scores out of 100 for each and provide specific suggestions for improvement, focusing on areas where the story could "show" rather than "tell."

---

### **1. How Gothic Is This Story? (Marked out of 100)**  
**Score: 85/100**

This story strongly captures many elements of gothic literature, creating a compelling atmosphere and exploring dark themes, though there’s room to deepen its gothic roots.

- **Atmosphere and Setting:**  
  The story excels at establishing a melancholic and ominous tone, a cornerstone of gothic literature. Descriptions like "Rain streaked the windows like tears on a mourner’s face" and "the sense of foreboding that clung to the air" immediately set a mood of dread. The office, portrayed as a "labyrinth of cubicles" and "tiny prison cells," feels oppressive, while the building’s personification ("it breathed, didn’t it?") adds a gothic sense of unease. However, the modern corporate setting lacks some traditional gothic imagery, such as decaying castles or crypts. While the twist of a glass tower works creatively, emphasizing its "moral decay" visually (e.g., cracks in the facade or flickering lights) could align it more closely with the genre.

- **Supernatural or Inexplicable Events:**  
  The shadowy figure that appears and vanishes is a classic gothic trope, generating mystery and tension. Its fleeting presence in the elevator, hallway, and break room effectively unnerves the reader. However, its role feels somewhat detached from the main plot—the moral dilemma over Case 19-45. Tying the shadow more explicitly to the firm’s corrupt past or the protagonist’s guilt would make it a stronger gothic element.

- **Themes of Moral Decay and Psychological Turmoil:**  
  The story shines here, a key strength of gothic literature. The firm’s unethical practices, the protagonist’s struggle with signing the document, and the compromised lives of Clara, Eddie, and Miles reflect moral decay and inner conflict. The "cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts" beautifully encapsulates this theme, blending gothic imagery with corporate critique.

- **Gothic Archetypes and Motifs:**  
  Victor Hargrove fits the gothic antagonist mold—a "predator born of boardrooms" with a cruel laugh and commanding presence. The shadow figure hints at a supernatural entity, but the story could lean more into archetypes like entrapment or madness to fully embrace the genre.

**Why 85?**  
The story nails atmosphere, moral decay, and unease, but the supernatural element isn’t fully integrated, and the modern setting misses some traditional gothic markers. With tighter connections and richer imagery, it could feel even more gothic.

---

### **2. Overall Story Quality (Marked out of 100)**  
**Score: 80/100**

This is a well-crafted narrative with evocative prose and solid character depth, though it has areas where subtlety and pacing could be improved.

- **Prose and Imagery:**  
  The writing is vivid and rich, with standout phrases like "the chemical client’s ghost" and "a cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts." These enhance the gothic tone and thematic depth. However, some descriptions, like "its pages heavy with compromise," feel slightly overwritten. Streamlining these could sharpen the narrative’s impact.

- **Character Development:**  
  The protagonist’s moral journey is compelling, and supporting characters—Clara with her rosary, Eddie with his limp, Miles with his disillusionment—add layers to the story. Their struggles humanize the firm’s corruption. Yet, Miles’s despair ("I can’t do this anymore") is stated rather than shown, weakening its effect. Subtle actions (e.g., trembling hands or a vacant stare) could convey this more powerfully.

- **Plot and Pacing:**  
  The tension builds well, culminating in the protagonist’s refusal to shred the evidence—a satisfying climax. The resolution, with sunlight breaking through, offers hope without feeling forced. However, the shift from indecision to action feels rushed. A deeper moment of reflection or a specific trigger could make the decision more earned.

- **Themes and Message:**  
  The exploration of integrity versus ambition in a corrupt system is thought-provoking and well-executed. The shadow figure’s ambiguity (conscience or specter?) adds intrigue, but its unclear role slightly dilutes the thematic cohesion. Linking it more directly to the firm’s sins or the protagonist’s choice would strengthen the message.

**Why 80?**  
The story is engaging and well-written, but it occasionally tells instead of shows, and the pacing could be refined. Fully integrating the shadow and polishing the prose would elevate it further.

---

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

Here are targeted ways to enhance the story, particularly by showing rather than telling:

1. **Integrate the Supernatural More Seamlessly:**  
   - **Current Issue:** The shadow figure feels peripheral to the plot.  
   - **Fix:** Connect it to the firm’s dark history or the protagonist’s dilemma. For example, have it appear more intensely as the protagonist nears the shredder, perhaps whispering indistinct words tied to past cases (e.g., "benzene" or "guilty"). This makes it a gothic symbol of reckoning, not just a mysterious presence.  
   - **Example Revision:** Instead of "the shadow solidified, its form almost tangible, a silent accusation," try: "The shadow loomed closer, its edges sharpening as I gripped the document, and a faint rasp—like a dying breath—echoed from the vents."

2. **Show, Don’t Tell Character Emotions:**  
   - **Current Issue:** Miles’s disillusionment is directly stated ("I can’t do this anymore").  
   - **Fix:** Replace dialogue with actions or imagery. Show his breaking point through physical cues or environment.  
   - **Example Revision:** Change "I can’t do this anymore," he muttered, to "Miles’s highlighter slipped from his hand, streaking yellow across the desk, his eyes fixed on nothing as the screen’s glow drained his face pale."

3. **Enhance Gothic Imagery in the Setting:**  
   - **Current Issue:** The modern office lacks some gothic decay.  
   - **Fix:** Add visual hints of moral rot to the pristine tower. Describe worn edges, eerie sounds, or a sense of the building "watching."  
   - **Example Revision:** Expand "The office was a labyrinth of cubicles" to "The office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat."

4. **Deepen the Protagonist’s Decision:**  
   - **Current Issue:** The choice to defy Hargrove feels abrupt.  
   - **Fix:** Build to it with a trigger or reflection. Perhaps the protagonist finds an old memo implicating the firm in harm, or recalls Eddie’s bitter smile, pushing them to act.  
   - **Example Revision:** Before "With a steady hand, I picked up the document," add: "I glanced at Eddie’s cart rattling past, its wheels groaning like a plea, and the shadow flickered—closer, colder. The words of an old case file flashed in my mind: *‘Lives lost, profits gained.’* My pen stilled."

---

### **Final Thoughts**

This is a strong gothic story that weaves atmosphere, moral conflict, and vivid imagery into a modern corporate nightmare. It earns **85/100** for its gothic qualities, with a few tweaks needed to fully root it in the genre. As a narrative, it scores **80/100**, offering a compelling read that could shine brighter with more subtlety and integration. By showing rather than telling and deepening its gothic elements, it could become an even more haunting tale. Well done!

#### draft with new plot line and assessment prompt

### The Ledger

**Rain fell in sheets as I crest the hill,** February 24, 2025. The engine coughs, sputters, dies. **Silence fills the car, broken only by me tightening my tie.** I turn the key—nothing. The headlights flicker, then fade, leaving me in a gray haze. **The mansion looms ahead, a shadow against the storm, its spires jagged as broken bones ( good but move it)**. Kessler, Hargrove & Tate’s client, **Mr. French, he is not french**, waits inside. **He summoned me here, urgent, no details—just an address and a time**. I grab my briefcase, step out, and start the climb.

The path twists upward, slick with mud. My shoes sink, **the hill’s air cold against my skin**. The mansion’s facade sharpens: stone gargoyles perch on the eaves, their eyes hollow, mouths stretched wide. **Ivy clings to the walls, tendrils thick as veins. I reach the door—black oak, brass knocker shaped like a ram’s skull—and it opens before I touch it.** A butler, thin as a shadow, nods. “Mr. Vellum is expecting you.”

He leads me through **halls draped in darkness,** portraits of stern-faced men glaring from the walls, **their eyes following my steps.** We pass rooms, doors ajar—beyond one, a flicker of light, **a sharp smell of formaldehyde and something sweeter, like decay**. **The butler pauses. “The laboratory, sir. Mr. Vellum’s… research.**” I glance inside: glass jars line the **shelves, each holding a shape—limbs, organs, suspended in amber liquid.** On a table, an **umbrella lies open, its canopy stitched from pale, translucent material that gleams wetly.** Human skin, I realize. Beside it, a beaker bubbles, water swirling in a vortex, sand suspended in its center, defying gravity. Another jar holds grains of sand, shifting as if alive. I swallow, my throat dry.

The butler clears his throat. “This way, sir.” We continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. Inside, Mr. Vellum **sits behind a mahogany desk**, his face sharp, **eyes gleaming like polished coins. “You’re late,” he says, voice smooth as oil. “But no matter. We have business.”**

He **slides** a file across the desk—Case 19-45. “This needs to disappear. Permanently. Your firm’s handled such things before.” His **gaze pins me**, **a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s **wing. “The contents are… sensitive. A competitor’s formula, acquired through unconventional means. And there’s another matter. My associate, exposed to the chemicals—she’s gone now. If this surfaces, we lose millions. You understand?”**

I nod, but my mind reels back—three days ago, **orientation** at Kessler, Hargrove & Tate. The senior paralegal’s **voice, flat as a deposition transcript**: “Billable target’s 1,800 hours. Partners track the keycard logs.” **Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings, her hands trembling. Eddie’s cart creaking, his hymn a dirge for his dreams. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a blade. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade before I’d applied. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed. (more)**

Back in Vellum’s office, the air thickens. “You’ll handle it?” he asks, leaning forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk. I see the lab again, the umbrella’s pale canopy, the water swirling, the sand shifting in its jar. **Ghosts of the firm’s past whisper through the vents: *Sign it. Bury it. Bill it.*** My pen hovers over the non-disclosure (????), the words blurring. “Yes,” I say, the syllable heavy as a stone.

**The lights flicker, die. Darkness floods the room, thick as ink.** Vellum’s voice cuts through: “Choose wisely.” When the lights return, he’s gone. Two doors stand before me, identical, both ajar. I pick the left, step through—and find myself outside, the rain now a drizzle, the hill’s air warm. **My car waits, engine purring, headlights piercing the mist.** I slide in, grip the wheel, and glance back. The mansion is gone, swallowed by fog, as if it never was.

I drive away, the road unfurling like a lie. In the rearview mirror, **something shifts—a shadow in the backseat, or perhaps just my reflection, hollow-eyed, forever changed.** The ledger’s **weight lingers**, my name etched in its pages, and I wonder if I’ve buried the file or merely **entombed myself deeper in the firm’s crypt**. **The rain resumes, harder now, drumming on the roof, and I press the gas, fleeing toward a dawn that may never come.**

**TO LOYALTY**
