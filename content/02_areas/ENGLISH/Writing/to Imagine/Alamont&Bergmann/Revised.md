You’d heard the name in whispers from the vents —the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.” You look around. You hear a suit being adjusted, a mug being gripped, and then a gentle sip.

The hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. Your car choked to death. Silence fills the car, broken only by you tightening your tie. You are left in the grey haze.

Bayer loomed in the threshold, his suit not merely fresh but impossibly pristine, as though stitched from the fabric of midnight itself. His skin stretched over his bones like damp parchment, so taut it threatened to tear, hinting at the unnatural vitality squirming beneath. When you grasped his hand, it repelled you—not with the warmth of flesh, but with the chill of ancient leather, the kind that binds tomes of forbidden lore, dry as dust and smooth as a gravestone.

His voice slithered forth, a rasp from bloodless lips: "Follow." The word lingered, oppressive as a funeral pall. As you obeyed, the walls seemed to breathe, inhaling light and hope, exhaling a cold that gnawed at your marrow. Dust sheets shrouded the furniture, but these were no mere coverings—they were tattered cerements, veiling shapes that bulged and writhed, grotesque silhouettes of things better left unseen. The floorboards sighed beneath your feet, each creak a labored exhalation from the house’s living heart.

Portraits lined the shadowed halls, their stern-faced subjects glaring down with eyes that didn’t merely follow—they pierced, they hungered. As you passed, their expressions twisted, sternness melting into malevolent sneers, lips curling as if tasting your fear. Ahead, a door hung ajar, its gap a yawning maw that whispered temptation.

Don’t look.  
You couldn’t resist.

The laboratory assaulted your senses with a miasma of formaldehyde, rot, and a cloying sweetness—like fruit festering in a crypt. Shelves groaned under the weight of jars, their contents suspended in fluids of amber, cyan, and nameless shades. Within, abominations writhed: rats, flayed and split, their viscera coiling with unnatural life; a fetus trapped in perpetual flux, its form flickering between rodent and infant, an eternal unborn horror. On the floor, what you took for umbrellas lay splayed—not fabric, but skin, human epidermis stretched taut over wire frames, translucent membranes threaded with veins that pulsed faintly, as though still tethered to life. Your throat tightened, bile rising as the truth sank in.

In the corner, a centrifuge droned, its hum a grotesque mimicry of a heartbeat, spinning vials of liquid so murky it devoured light. The air thickened, pressing against you like a sentient force, and the house itself seemed to watch—its walls, its portraits, its very essence—judging, craving, consuming.

His gaze impales you, a collector’s pin piercing a butterfly’s fragile wing, crushing your spirit beneath its unyielding weight, forcing you to stillness, to submission. Your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth, dry as ash, as if the air itself has withered it to dust.

Two weeks prior, they ushered you into the shredder room—a crypt of secrets. Hargrove’s smirk twisted like a reaper’s scythe as he rasped, “Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,” his hand caressing the machine as though it were a ravenous beast, its jaws gnashing for flesh, not just paper. The air hung thick with the stench of scorched ink and something fouler—decay, perhaps, or the slow festering of consciences long buried.
...
And there, in the ledger, your name—scrawled in 2015, a decade before your arrival, the ink bleeding like a fresh wound. “Typo,” Clara muttered, but her voice trembled, and the page seemed to pulse. You stood in a place you never imagined, yet the estate and the firm mirrored each other—twin labyrinths of corruption, their roots entwined in shadow.

“Your cubicle is here,” she commanded, her voice a whip’s crack. “This is your in-box, your out-box. You will labor over what is given, deliver it to the partners. You will obey. You will shred when commanded. You will toil after dusk—overtime earns no coin. You will not answer the phone past 6 PM—let it drift to the tomb of voicemail.” The office sprawled before you, a decaying garden of cubicles, their walls peeling like sloughing bark, the vents exhaling a low, guttural hum—the building’s breath, heavy with the rot of trapped souls.

Down the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, a wilted husk. His highlighter trembled, then dragged his hand downward, streaking yellow across the desk like a smear of jaundice. His eyes remained fixed, unblinking, as if the screen leeched the life from his pallid face. Then came the soft thud—the highlighter slipping to the carpet. Slowly, he began to turn—clockwise, head guiding shoulder, a mechanical twist, as though marionette strings jerked him toward the void. For four endless seconds, his gaze swept the empty air behind him, seeking nothing. There was nothing. His frame sagged further, collapsing inward. On his desk, a Christmas basket moldered—it was February—a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.” A relic of the ’80s benzene case, when the firm severed its last thread of virtue.

That was your orientation. Her voice faded into the gloom: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”

Now, in Bayer’s office, his jaw unhinges, stretching too wide for mortal flesh, a grotesque blossom of malice. He leans forward, his shadow unfurling, a creeping vine that devours the desk, the room, the very air. The walls tighten, the estate and firm fusing into one suffocating maw, and you are no longer merely pinned—you are planted, rooted in this garden of despair, awaiting the Gardener’s pruning blade.

Back at your cubicle, a shadow pools—tall, slender, bleeding into the dark. Don’t turn. You know better.

The firm had many teeth, and you are simply the latest to be sharpened. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, its hunger for secrets never sated—a beast always ready to devour the truth.

You don’t hear, but feel the whisper now, a cold breath against your soul: “Good job. Welcome to Alamont & Bergmann. You’ve proven your worth. Now, keep climbing.”

The corporate ladder stretches before you, each rung slick with the grease of compromised ethics. You’ve taken your first step by shredding that file, by burying the firm’s sins in its shadows. The path back is lost in the fog of your ambition, and the view from here is already tainted by the weight of your choice.

The shredder’s growl becomes a lullaby, soothing you into the numbness of complicity. 
And as the rain continues to lash the windows, you’ve made your choice.
