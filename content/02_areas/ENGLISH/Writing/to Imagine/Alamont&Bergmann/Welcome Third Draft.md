The rain smeared Alamont & Bergmann’s tower into a watercolor of dread, its windows streaked like the veins of some leviathan rising from the city’s underbelly. Inside, the air tasted of toner dust and mothballed secrets. You’d survived two weeks in this mausoleum of billable hours, yet your cubicle still reeked of the last occupant—a cloying mix of bergamot and panic.

The assignment arrived at dawn, slipped under your door in a manila envelope swollen with humidity. *Case 16-08*. No instructions, only a Post-it: *Bayer Estate. 3 PM. Do not speak unless spoken to.* You’d heard the name in whispers—the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash-filled suitcases. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.”

**The Descent**

The hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. When your car choked to death at the base, you understood why associates vanished after these visits. No Ubers in purgatory.

The mansion wasn’t architecture—it was a tumor. Limestone walls bulged as if something pulsed beneath, ivy strangling the cracks like sutures. Gargoyles perched above the door, their mouths agape in silent screams, rainwater pooling in their hollow eyes. You counted six before the door creaked open.

Bayer stood framed in the threshold, a cadaver in a three-piece suit. His skin hung too tight over the bones, as if starched. When you shook his hand, the texture shocked you—not flesh, but cured leather, the kind used to bind forbidden ledgers.

“Follow,” he rasped, turning without checking if you obeyed.  

The foyer swallowed light. Dust sheets draped furniture into ghostly shapes, and the floorboards groaned like old gallows. Portraits lined the walls—Bayer ancestors with eyes blackened by time, their stares needling your spine. You passed a half-open door.

*Don’t look.*  

You looked.  

The laboratory stank of formaldehyde and rotting pears. Shelves sagged under jars of amber liquid, each housing horrors: rats with human teeth, their bodies split open to reveal coiled viscera; a fetus floating mid-transformation, half-rodent, half-infant. On the floor, umbrellas lay splayed like skinned bats, their canopies translucent—*membrane*, you realized, stomach lurching. Human epidermis stretched over wire ribs.

Bayer didn’t pause. “A hobby,” he said, as a centrifuge hummed in the corner, spinning vials of murky fluid.



**The Transaction**

His office was a sarcophagus. The mahogany desk gleamed under a single pendant light, its surface barren except for a rotary phone and a jar of peppermints that might’ve been decades old. He slid the file toward you.  

“Disappear this. Permanently.”

The pages were blank.

No—not blank. You tilted them toward the light and saw the indentations, the ghost of text pressed into the paper by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: *Lena Voss, 34, exposure event.*

“My competitor’s research,” Bayer said, fingers steepled. “And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” His voice softened, a scalpel sheathed in velvet. “Your firm excels at… *cleanup*. Bill it as document review.”  

Your tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth. Two weeks earlier, they’d shown you the shredder room—industrial-grade, capable of pulverizing cement. *“Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,”* Hargrove had smirked, patting the machine like a beloved hound.

**The Firm’s Teeth**

Memories bled into the present:
*Clara at 2 AM*, hunched over discovery documents, her rosary beads click-clacking like a deathwatch beetle. *“They promoted Miles after the Brighton case,”* she’d muttered, highlighter trembling over a deposition. *“He found the loophole. The family couldn’t sue after… the accident.”*

*Eddie the mail clerk*, limping past your desk, his cart overflowing with envelopes stamped *CONFIDENTIAL*. He’d paused, fixing you with milky eyes. *“Watch the clocks here. They run backward sometimes.”*

*Hargrove’s laugh* sawing through the floorboards, his office a glass-walled vault. *“We’re not butchers,”* he’d told you during orientation, straightening a framed photo of himself shaking hands with a senator. *“We’re surgeons. Society needs its tumors cut out.”*

Now, in Bayer’s tomb, the shadows thickened. The pendant light flickered.

“Well?” Bayer’s jaw unhinged slightly, too wide for a human smile.

You reached for your pen. The firm’s motto throbbed in your skull: *Sign it, bill it, bury it.*

The lights died.

**The Choice**

When they sputtered back on, Bayer was gone. Two doors materialized in the far wall, both ajar. Through the left—moonlight, rain, your idling car. Through the right—a corridor lined with more doors, each numbered *16-08*.

You chose the left.

The hill’s air now reeked of burnt sugar. Your car started instantly, the radio whispering static. As you reversed, the mansion’s windows flashed—figures pressed against the glass, their palms leaving smears. One resembled Lena Voss’s employee badge photo. Another, Eddie.

The road unspooled into the city’s glow. In the rearview, your reflection wavered—eyes hollow, hair streaked white. The file sat beside you, its pages now visible:

*Lena Voss v. Bayer Chemical*.

*Cause of death: acute exposure to Compound 16-08. Symptoms: epidermal shedding, ocular hemorrhage, vocal cord liquefaction.*

*Recommended action: settlement via non-disclosure. Client requests all biological remains incinerated.*

Beneath, a sticky note in Hargrove’s jagged script: *“Burn after reading. Welcome to the team.”*

**Epilogue: The Clocktower**

Back at Alamont & Bergmann, the night shift toiled under flickering fluorescents. Clara’s rosary beads were gone, her wrist ringed with fresh burns. Eddie’s cart now carried a jar of peppermints.

You shredded Lena’s file, the machine screaming like a living thing.

At 3:33 AM, your phone buzzed—a client alert. *Case 16-08 closed. 15.0 billable hours logged.*

Outside your cubicle, a shadow coalesced. Tall, slender, its edges bleeding into the dark. You didn’t turn. You knew better now.

The firm had many teeth. You were simply the latest.  

Rain lashed the windows as you typed, the keys clattering like bones. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, hungry again.

**THE LEDGER'S WHISPER**

*(A Gothic Revision)*

  

The rain bled down Alamont & Bergmann’s tower, warping the skyline into a watercolor of dread. Your new cubicle smelled of lemon polish and decay—two weeks in this sepulcher of billable hours, yet the air still carried the iron tang of something long entombed. Across the window, a rivulet traced the path of a tear down darkened glass.

  

Six figures. That’s what they’d promised. Enough to choke your student loans into silence. You hadn’t asked why the previous associate’s name was scrubbed from the doorplate, nor why the ledger in HR bore your signature dated 2015—ten years before you’d stumbled into this interview. "Scrivener’s error," the administrator had smiled, nail tapping the smudged ink. Her reflection in the window that day had shown no one behind her desk.

**The Summons**

  

The partner’s voice still claws at your spine: *"Mr. Bayer’s estate. 4PM. Do try not to disappoint us."* Colleagues raised their heads as you stood—a jury of specters in pinstripes. Clara’s rosary beads clicked like counting bones. Eddie’s mail cart creaked a dirge. None wished you luck.

  

Rain died as your company sedan coughed itself still beneath the hill. The mansion above floated on a miasma of mist, its limestone façade pockmarked like an acid-eaten skull. Ivy slithered across the walls, glistening. Halfway up the path, your polished Oxfords sank into the earth as if the ground itself resisted your approach. Above the door, a gargoyle’s chiseled scream watched you through hollow eyes.

  

The knob turned before your touch.

  

"Punctual." Mr. Bayer stood framed in the threshold, his grip crushing your fingers to chalk. "We value that here." His laboratory stank of formaldehyde and burnt sugar. Through an ajar door, glass jars bubbled—one held a rat mid-transformation, fur replaced by glistening scales. Another contained what might have been a human tongue floating in ambergris. You counted seventeen open umbrellas on the floor, their canopies stretched taut like preserved skin.

  

His study swallowed sound. The mahogany desk gleamed with oiled malevolence as he slid Case 16-08 toward you. "A competitor’s formula. My former associate...overly curious. You’ll find her objections withdrawn." His smile revealed teeth filed to points. "Alamont’s usual methods should suffice."

  

The file weighed nothing. It *burned* nothing. Yet your palms blistered.

**The Firm’s Teeth**

  

Orientation returned to you then—the way Hargrove had materialized behind your chair, breath reeking of single malt and sealed settlements. *"That ledger binds you,*" he’d whispered. *"We all sign twice here—once in ink, once in blood."*

  

You’d laughed nervously until noticing Miles across the hall. The junior partner sat frozen before his monitor, highlighter trembling in a hand gone translucent. His head swiveled 180 degrees with the creak of overstressed vertebrae, mouthing *"Run"* before snapping back to his deposition.

  

Now, in Bayer’s choking silence, you understood. The formula in your hands wasn’t corporate espionage—it was alchemy. The rats in jars weren’t experiments. They were *witnesses*.

  

The lights died.

  

When they flickered back, two doors stood where Bayer had been. From the left came Clara’s rosary clatter. From the right, Eddie’s hymn. Your pen moved without consent, the signature blooming on the document like an infection.

**The Road From the Hill**

  

Your car waited obediently, engine purring. The rearview mirror showed only fog until mile three—then the silhouette emerged. Not Bayer. Not Hargrove. A thing with too many joints folded into the backseat, its breath frosting glass.

  

*"Well negotiated,"* it rasped. The voice held Clara’s grief and Miles’s broken laugh. *"Shall we discuss your billing quota?"*

  

Rain hammered the windshield as Alamont’s tower reappeared—a monolith growing teeth against the storm. Eddie stood in the lobby, his mail cart overflowing with sealed urns. He nodded as you passed, humming a hymn you now recognized as a requiem.

  

At your desk, the ledger lay open. Your 2015 signature glistened fresh, below it a new entry: *Case 16-08 - Disposition: Permanent Silence. Client Satisfaction: 94%. Associate Compliance: Verified.*

  

The shadow in your cubicle doorway applauded softly.

1. **Heightened Stakes**

- Compliance directly linked to physical metamorphosis (Miles’s turning, translucent skin)

- Firm’s true product revealed as "silence" commodified

  

1. **Ambiguous Antagonist**
