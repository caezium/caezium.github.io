Welcome 

It is, probably, very seldom that ordinary people like you landed this job. 6 figures.
A colonial office building, a hereditary business, a prestigious firm, you could say a haunted house judging from what is rumored, but no one knows what goes on inside.

The rain smeared Alamont & Bergmann’s tower like tears on a mourner's face, into a watercolor of dread. They said the view would get better up here, but the scenery was a foreboding blur. Inside, the air tasted of toner dust and mothballed secrets. You’d survived two weeks in this mausoleum of billable hours, yet your cubicle still reeked of the last occupant.

The assignment arrived at dawn, slipped under your door in an envelope swollen with humidity. *Case 16-08*. No instructions, only a Post-it: *Bayer Estate. 3 PM. Do not speak unless spoken to.* You’d heard the name in whispers from the vents —the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.” You look around. You hear a suit being adjusted, a mug being gripped, and then a gentle sip. 


The hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. Your car choked to death. Silence fills the car, broken only by you tightening your tie. You are left in the grey haze. 

The mansion wasn’t architecture—it was a tumor. A shadow against the storm. Limestone walls bulged as if something pulsed beneath, ivy strangling the cracks like sutures. Gargoyles perched above the door, their mouths agape in silent screams, rainwater pooling in their hollow eyes. You counted six before the door creaked open.


Bayer stood framed in the threshold, in a fresh suit. His skin hung too tight over the bones, as if starched. When you shook his hand, the texture shocked you—not flesh, but cured leather, the kind used to bind forbidden ledgers.

You hear him rasp, telling you to follow him. The walls swallowed light. Dust sheets draped furniture into ghostly shapes, and the floorboards groaned. You are lead through halls with portraits of stern-faced men as their eyes follow your steps. You passed a half-open door.

*Don’t look.*  
You looked.  

The laboratory stank of formaldehyde and rot. Shelves sagged under jars of amber and cyan liquid, each housing horrors: rats, mutated, alive, dead, their bodies split open to reveal coiled viscera; a fetus floating mid-transformation, half-rodent, half-infant. On the floor, umbrellas lay splayed like skinned bats, their canopies translucent—*membrane*, you realized, human epidermis stretched over wire ribs. You swallow, your throat is dry. A centrifuge hummed in the corner, spinning vials of murky fluid.

You continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. My. Bayer goes to sit behind a mahogany desk, sleek, rectangular, the only piece of furniture that seemed to be up kept. 
You are slid a file towards you by him.
“Disappear this. Permanently.”
The pages were blank.
No—not blank. You tilted them toward the light and saw the indentations, the ghost of text pressed into the paper by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: *Senna Voss, 34, exposure event.*

“My competitor’s research,”
“And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” You detect that his voice softened.
“Your firm excels at… *cleanup*. Bill it as document review. I will handle the rest afterwards.”
You see his eyes glance behind you, into the lab, you try to not realize.

His gaze pins me, like a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing, squishing you, and forcing you to comply and stay still. Your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth. 
Two weeks earlier, they’d shown you the shredder room. *“Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,”* Hargrove had smirked, patting the machine like a beloved hound. Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings, her rosary swinging like a grandfather clock. Eddie’s cart creaking, his limp, his fall from the ladder, his hymn. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a guillotine, straightening a framed photo of himself shaking hands with a senator. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade ago. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed. You find yourself in a place where you don't think you will ever be in, but it does not feel totally different here in this estate or at the firm.

"Your cubicle is here. This is your in and out box, you will do the work in your in box and hand them in in your out box or directly to firm partners. You will do what you are told to. You will shred if asked to shred. You will come in after hours, overtime is not paid. You will not answer your phone if it rings past 6pm, let it roll to voicemail."


The office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat.
Down the hall, Miles slumped in his chair. His highlighter's tip wobbled, then followed the upper part of the body, the highlighter slipped, but it brought his hand down with it, streaking yellow across the desk. His eyes did not waver though, it stayed fixed on his screen, as if it drained his face pale. Fixed. You hear a highlighter being dropped onto the floor. He then slowly, started turning clockwise, head followed by shoulder. What was he turning for. You observer that the turn lasted for 4 seconds, there was nothing behind him. He turned, his body sagged. His desk held a Christmas basket, it was February, a card pinned beneath: _"To loyalty."_  A specter from the '80s benzene case.

That was orientation. She left you there, her voice trailing off: "Pace yourself. The clock's ticking."

“Well?” Bayer’s jaw unhinges slightly, too wide for a human smile. He leans forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk.
You reached for your pen. 
The lights died.
When they sputtered back on, Bayer was gone. Two doors materialized in the far wall, both ajar. You chose the left.

The hill’s air now reeked of burnt sugar. Your car started instantly, the radio whispering static. As you reversed, the mansion’s windows flashed—figures pressed against the glass, their palms leaving smears. One resembled Lena Voss’s employee badge photo. Another, Eddie.
The road unspooled into the city’s glow. In the rearview, your reflection wavered—eyes hollow, hair streaked white. The file sat beside you, its pages now visible:

*Lena Voss v. Bayer Chemical*.

*Cause of death: acute exposure to Compound 16-08. Symptoms: epidermal shedding, ocular hemorrhage, vocal cord liquefaction.*

*Recommended action: settlement via non-disclosure. Client requests all biological remains be given to him, for bury.*



Outside your cubicle, a shadow coalesced. Tall, slender, its edges bleeding into the dark. You didn’t turn. You know better now.
The firm had many teeth. You are simply the latest.  

Rain lashed the windows as you typed, the keys clattering like bones. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, hungry again.

You don't hear, but feel the whisper now. Good job. Welcome to Alamont & Bergmann, do your job now.

### **1. Literary Devices (16/25)**  
**Strengths:**  
- Vivid metaphors ("mausoleum of billable hours," "the mansion was a tumor") and grotesque imagery (umbrellas as "skinned bats," mutated specimens) effectively evoke dread.  
- Symbolism (blank pages with ghost text, "the Gardener") hints at hidden corruption, aligning with Gothic themes of secrecy.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Overuse of strained metaphors**: Some comparisons (e.g., "asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud") feel repetitive rather than impactful.  
- **Mixed imagery**: The lab’s "human epidermis umbrellas" borders on sensationalism, risking reader immersion.  
- **Underdeveloped motifs**: The recurring "ledger" and "2015 typo" lack clear symbolic payoff, leaving the theme of guilt incomplete.  

---

### **2. Use of Gothic Genre (18/25)**  
**Strengths:**  
- **Atmosphere**: Strongly establishes a claustrophobic, decaying world (toner dust, mothballed secrets, "limestone walls bulged").  
- **Tropes**: Effective use of Gothic staples: reclusive aristocrat, haunted estate, grotesque experiments, and moral decay.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Clichés**: Gargoyles with "hollow eyes" and portraits with "following eyes" lack originality.  
- **Pacing**: The abrupt shift to flashbacks (Hargrove, Clara) disrupts tension. Prioritize slow-burn unease over disjointed reveals.  
- **Plot coherence**: The protagonist’s role ("Disappear this. Permanently.") and connection to Senna Voss are underexplored, weakening narrative stakes.  

---

### **3. Punctuation Variety (12/20)**  
**Strengths:**  
- Effective use of em dashes and fragments ("Don’t look. You looked.") to heighten tension.  
- Colons and semicolons ("Case 16-08. No instructions, only a Post-it: Bayer Estate. 3 PM.") create a brisk, clinical tone.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Comma splices**: "You swallow, your throat is dry" should be revised to a period or semicolon.  
- **Inconsistent tense**: Shifts between past and present (e.g., "You are lead" → "led"; "His gaze pins me" → "pinned") disrupt flow.  
- **Overuse of hyphens**: "half-rodent, half-infant" works, but "mothballed-secrets" (hyphen needed) is missing punctuation.  

---

### **4. Sentence Structure (13/20)**  
**Strengths:**  
- Varied sentence lengths build rhythm (e.g., short, punchy phrases like "Silence fills the car" contrast with longer descriptions).  
- Intentional fragments ("A name: Senna Voss, 34, exposure event.") enhance mystery.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Passive voice**: "You are slid a file" → "He slides a file" would sharpen immediacy.  
- **Awkward phrasing**: "You are lead through halls..." (tense error) and "the ink seemed to bleed" (mixed metaphor).  
- **Convoluted syntax**: "His gaze pins me, like a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing, squishing you..." confuses perspective (me/you).  

---

### **5. Reader Response (15/20)**  
**Strengths:**  
- **Immersion**: The oppressive atmosphere and sensory details ("reeked of the last occupant," "formaldehyde and rot") successfully unsettle the reader.  
- **Ambiguity**: The unresolved ending ("a place where you don't think you will ever be") suits Gothic uncertainty.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Emotional disconnect**: The protagonist’s internal conflict (e.g., guilt over Senna Voss) is told, not shown, reducing empathy.  
- **Confusion**: Flashbacks (Eddie’s fall, Clara’s rosary) feel tangential without clear ties to the main plot.  

---
**Summary:**  
This story demonstrates a strong grasp of Gothic aesthetics and mood but suffers from structural and technical inconsistencies. The imagery is visceral but occasionally overwrought, and the plot’s ambiguity crosses into confusion. Tighten narrative focus, refine punctuation, and clarify character motivations to elevate cohesion and impact.  

**Actionable Feedback:**  
- Simplify metaphors; prioritize precision over extravagance.  
- Fix tense shifts and punctuation errors to maintain immersion.  
- Flesh out Senna Voss/the ledger subplot to deepen thematic resonance.  
- Replace clichéd Gothic tropes with fresher, more nuanced horrors.
