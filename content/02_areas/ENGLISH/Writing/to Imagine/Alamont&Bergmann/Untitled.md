You’ve clawed your way into this job—six figures, a colonial office tower, a prestigious firm steeped in shadows. Alamont & Bergmann isn’t just a business; it’s a hereditary beast, its rumors whispering of a haunted house. No one knows what festers inside, but you’re about to find out.

Rain smears the tower’s windows like a mourner’s tears, blurring the city into a haze of dread. They promised the view would improve up here, but the mist swallows everything below. Inside, the air chokes with toner dust and mothballed secrets. Two weeks in this mausoleum of billable hours, and your cubicle still reeks of the last occupant’s fear.

The assignment arrives at dawn, slipped under your door in an envelope swollen with humidity. Case 16-08. No instructions, just a Post-it: Bayer Estate. 3 PM. Do not speak unless spoken to. Listen closely—whispers slither through the vents, carrying the name of the Gardener, the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who pays in cash. Partners murmur his title with trembling reverence, their eyes darting to the shadows. You glance around—the office’s crumbling facades close in, shadows shifting as if alive. A suit rustles, a mug clinks, a sip echoes. The rain hammers harder, drumming a warning against the glass. The envelope pulses in your hand, alive with the unknown. Step into the storm—it’s time.

The hill to Bayer’s estate devours the road—asphalt fractures into gravel, gravel drowns in mud. Your car sputters, the engine choking as the air thickens. Tighten your tie; the silence presses in. Step out—the mansion looms through the grey haze, a tumor masquerading as architecture. Limestone walls bulge, ivy stitching the cracks like veins. Gargoyles leer from above, their hollow eyes weeping rainwater. Count them—six—before the door groans open.

Bayer stands there, his skin taut as cured leather, a binding for forbidden ledgers. His suit is pristine, but he reeks of rot. Shake his hand—feel it, not flesh, but something cultivated, preserved. “Follow me,” he rasps. The walls devour the light as you enter. Dust sheets cloak furniture into spectral forms, floorboards moaning underfoot. Portraits glare down, their eyes tracking you. Pass a half-open door.

Don’t look.  
You look.

The laboratory reeks of formaldehyde and decay. Shelves bow under jars of amber and cyan, each a nursery for horrors: rats, split open, their viscera coiled like roots; a fetus, half-rodent, half-child, suspended in mid-bloom. Umbrellas splay on the floor, their canopies translucent—human skin stretched over wire, pruned into grotesque perfection. A centrifuge hums, tending vials of murky fluid. This isn’t a lab—it’s a garden of monstrosities, each specimen cultivated, pruned, harvested.

Swallow your dread and move on. Bayer’s office waits, its mahogany desk a sleek, tended bloom amid the decay. He slides a file toward you. “Disappear this. Permanently.”

The pages seem blank. Tilt them—see the ghost of text, etched by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: Lena Voss, 34, exposure event. “My competitor’s research,” Bayer says, his voice a dry rustle. “And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” His tone softens, a gardener mourning a wilted plant. “Your firm excels at cleanup. Bill it as document review. I’ll tend the rest.”

His gaze pins you, a collector’s needle through your wings. Your tongue cleaves to your mouth.

Recall two weeks ago. They showed you the shredder room. “Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,” Hargrove smirked, stroking the machine like a pet. Clara’s pen gouged dirt from tax filings, her rosary swaying. Eddie’s cart creaked, his limp a hymn. Miles Tanner’s grin faded in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh sliced the air, adjusting a photo with a senator. The ledger—your name, scrawled in 2015, a decade ago. “Typo,” she said, but the ink bled.

You were commanded then: Work your in-box, fill your out-box, shred when told. Come after hours—no overtime. Ignore calls past 6 PM. The office sprawls, its cubicles peeling, the vents growling with the building’s pulse. Miles slumps nearby, his highlighter streaking yellow as his hand falters. His eyes drain pale, fixed on nothing. A Christmas basket rots on his desk—it’s February—a card pinned: “To loyalty.” A ghost from the ’80s benzene case.

She left you there: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”

“Well?” Bayer’s jaw gapes, a smile too wide. His shadow swallows the desk.

Reach for your pen.  
The lights die.

They flicker back—Bayer’s gone. Two doors yawn open. Choose the left.

Back at your cubicle, a shadow pools—tall, slender, bleeding into the dark. Don’t turn. You know better.

The firm has teeth. You’re its newest. Rain lashes the windows as you type, keys rattling like bones. The shredder growls below, ravenous.

Feel it now, not hear it: Good job. Welcome to Alamont & Bergmann. Do your job.
