As tourists flock to picturesque cities and natural wonders, what do they leave behind? Much like normal walking, people leave behind a ton of footprints – ones that both can both contribute 

to the local economy and disrupt local culture and environments. While tourism can boost the global economy, if its growth gets left unchecked, it will trample on the very places it seeks to celebrate, leading to environmental degradation, cultural dilution, and overcrowding.

Venice is a top-rate tourist city. For those who have been there, the experience is like a serene dream. However, most tourists do not look back at what they are leaving behind. It's only when they come back after their first visit, do they see the crowded cards, polluted waterways and compromised cultures. At its peak season, Verice offers 120,000 tourists a ‘vacation away from morals’, that is almost half the amount of its residents! This is a clear case of overtourism, where 80% of tourists go to 10% of the world’s places. Because of this, many tourist destinations are victims of their own popularity. In the case of Venice, not only does it lead to congestion, pollution and degradation, it also leads to Venice being viewed as a big theme park rather than a city. Traditional homes might be replaced by souvenir shops and luxury hotels, eroding away at the city’s culture and turning once authentic places into tourist traps. Venice is losing its culture and being transformed into a superficial tourist commodity rather than a place that can host millions and millions of authentic, nostalgic, and lifelong memories for its residents.

Supporters for tourism claim that because the tourism industry amounts to 7.6% of the global GOP, it is beneficial for the world while providing relaxation for people. However, can a percentage of the global GDP fix the irreversible damage on our Earth? In 2019, the United Nations concluded that 5% of the global CO2 emissions and 22% of transport emissions were from tourism. Carbon emissions lead to climate change, which affects us all. We see that right now with the increased amount of hurricanes and the flooding of the Sahara Desert. Most people fly to the places they want to tour. Instead, have you ever wanted to go on a cruise ship? To feel the waves as the afternoon breeze gently sweeps your face? Certainly, the experience may be nice, but each trip on a cruise ship emits 1.2 - 9 tors of CO2. Considering even transatlantic flights produce less than 1 ton of CO2, that is a lot for a short ride on a long boat. If you somehow don't care about climate change, think about the effects of CO2 on the very places you visit. The Great Barrier Reef's corals are bleaching due to the warmer Ocean; ski resorts are facing shorter seasons to operate because of the dwindling snowfall. It is my considered opinion that the long-term damage to the environment far outweighs the temporary economic boosts.

Ultimately, the harms of tourism exist and we are starting to acknowledge that. Most tourist attractions haven't been implementing mitigations or solutions, but some are starting to, Effective management, ecotourism and community-based tourism can make tourism more sustainable and friendlier to the environment and culture. Ecotourism is a form of tourism but with responsible travel and prioritization to visit natural sceneries with an aim to conserve that local culture and environment. Places like Kenya National Park are implementing community-based tourism, where all the revenue goes back into balancing and managing the tourists’ footprints. Due to global travel restrictions during the pandemic, the crowds disappeared and cities finally saw the footprints left by tourism. Venice started introducing visitor fees to reduce the amount of visitors and renovate Infrastructure; Amsterdam imposed a ban on cruise ships to reduce their carbon footprint.

Tourism's damages to the environment and local people are undoubtedly undeniable. But this road to climate change and commodified cities can change if we participate and promote practices such as ecotourism, educate others, urge policy makers and reflect on our footprints. Just ask yourself this next time you travel: are you visiting to appreciate or to exploit?
