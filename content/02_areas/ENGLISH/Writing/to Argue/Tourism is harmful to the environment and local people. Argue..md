==Cons==
- Tourism, a significant contributor to the global economy, treads a fine line between exploitation and preservation. As travelers seek out the world's wonders, they inevitably leave footprints - some beneficial, others detrimental. This article unpacks the complex relationship between tourism, the environment, and climate change, exploring the balance we must achieve for a sustainable future.
- Tourism - one of the world's largest industries, worth [7.6%](https://wttc.org/research/economic-impact#:~:text=WTTC's%20latest%20annual%20research%20shows,only%2023%25%20below%202019%20levels.) of global GDP every year
- it can lead to a greater appreciation for nature and conservation, as tourists explore pristine beaches, lush forests, and scenic landscapes. This appreciation can translate into increased funding for national parks, wildlife conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage sites. For example, the revenue generated by the millions of tourists visiting Australia's Great Barrier [Reef](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-coral-reefs) also helps [fund](https://barrierreef.org/the-reef/the-value)conservation efforts to protect this unique [ecosystem](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/ecosystem-definition-components-and-structure).
-  Mass tourism - where the number of tourists outpaces an area's capacity - can damage ecosystems, disrupt or harm local wildlife, and lead to pollution. Venice, for example, has seen its canals crowded with boats and its historic streets thronged with visitors, leading to accelerated wear on its historic sites and increased pollution in its waters. Barcelona. It is one of the most important tourist destinations in Spain. Famous for its architecture, beaches, gastronomy, and culture. Mass tourism has driven locals out of the real estate market, as the amount of housing available for rent has been significantly reduced. To regulate this problem, actions have been taken such as the regulation of tourist accommodations, the prohibition of hotel construction, taxes on tourism and a limitation on the number of visitors. Venice. This Italian city, characterized by its canals, architecture, and history, has suffered from tourist overcrowding for years. Congestion, water pollution, erosion of buildings due to the entry of large boats, loss of identity, and price increases. To regulate this congestion, Venice has implemented city entrance fees, zone restrictions, the promotion of responsible tourism and the limitation of cruise ship entry.
- Venice has many nicknames: the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’, the ‘Floating City’ and ‘La Serenissima’ – the most serene. But as anyone who has been to Venice knows, on a typical day it can feel anything but serene. The city is notoriously mobbed with tourists. Up to 120,000 people visit Venice each day in peak season, but it has only 55,000 permanent residents. It is a phenomenon known as “overtourism”, where too many people visit the same place at the same time.Overtourism is a big problem, with 80% of the world’s tourists only going to 10% of the world’s destinations, according to the start-up consultancy Murmuration. Venice is probably the most notorious example, but other European cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam, Dubrovnik and Prague are also badly affected. The problem does not just make life unpleasant for residents and visits less enjoyable for tourists, it also puts significant strain on the environment and is hurting the climate. So many people flying into the same place degrades local ecosystems and natural defences against the effects of climate change. This in turn is causing worries that these oversaturated cities are going to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. The [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.energymonitor.ai/topic/covid-19/), which saw tourism to Venice suddenly stop completely, gave tourism operators a chance to pause and think. While the city stood eerily deserted, and businesses had to worry about how they would make ends meet, some also started to think – what if we didn’t go back to overtourism after this? Maggiori and a group of other tourism operators in the Veneto region decided to launch the 'Slow Flow' concept, organised visits around the rivers that feed the Venetian lagoon, by bike and boat. This can draw tourists out of Venice. It can also make for a more authentic experience.
- The UN’s World Tourism Organization and the International Transport Forum concluded in 2019 that 5% of global emissions – and 22% of global transport emissions – are from transport-related international and domestic tourism. Overtourism’s worst offender is cruise ship tourism, which in 2016 emitted 24–30 million tonnes (t) of CO₂, with per passenger emissions ranging from 1.2–9t of CO₂ per trip. By comparison, a transatlantic flight emits a bit less than [one tonne](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/ICCT_2014_TA-airline-ranking_factsheet_0.pdf) of CO2 per passenger, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. That means taking a cruise emits up to nine times more carbon than flying across the Atlantic.
- popular trekking trails in Nepal have experienced littering, resulting in environmental degradation.
- The [carbon footprint](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/company-guide/carbon-footprint-calculate-reduce-and-offset-your-impact) of tourism is another critical concern. [Air travel](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/could-aviation-be-decarbonised-and-become-sustainable), a significant component of global tourism, contributes substantially to greenhouse gas [emissions](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/carbon-emissions-what-you-need-to-know) and therefore [climate change](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/climate-change-in-2022-where-do-we-stand). The aviation sector contributes around 2% of annual global carbon dioxide emissions. A single long-haul flight can emit as much carbon dioxide as many people produce in a whole year.
- Popular destinations like the Maldives face the threat of [rising sea levels](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/sea-level-rise-what-is-happening), while natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef are endangered by coral bleaching due to warmer oceans. Additionally, ski resorts are increasingly struggling with shorter seasons due to dwindling snowfall. This reciprocal relationship between tourism and climate change highlights the urgent need for sustainable practices within the industry.
- One of the most significant negative impacts of tourism is the degradation of natural environments. Tourist hotspots, particularly those in ecologically sensitive areas, frequently undergo habitat destruction due to infrastructure development. For example, the construction of hotels, resorts, roads, and other tourism facilities can result in [deforestation](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/deforestation-definition-effects-and-solutions), alteration of land, depletion of natural resources, and disruption to local ecosystems. In places like Bali, once-idyllic beaches are now flanked by sprawling resorts, affecting marine life and leading to significant erosion of the shoreline.
- the influx of tourists surpasses the local waste management capacity, leading to pollution. For example, Mount Everest, often referred to as the "[world's highest garbage dump](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/trash-and-overcrowding-top-world)" is littered with oxygen cylinders, plastic waste, and even camping equipment discarded by climbers. Such uncontrolled waste not only spoils the landscape but can also contaminate local water sources, impacting both human and wildlife populations.
- Noise and light pollution are additional concerns in areas with heavy tourist traffic. The constant hum of boats, vehicles, and human activity can disturb wildlife (including vulnerable and endangered species), affecting their natural behaviors and breeding patterns. Sea turtles, for example, which rely on the moonlight to find their way from the beach to the ocean, can be disoriented by the bright lights from beachfront properties, making their survival even more precarious.
==Pros==
-  numerous regions across the globe, tourism is the primary source of income, playing an instrumental role in sustaining economies and driving development. For countries with limited industrial or agricultural potential, the allure of their natural or cultural heritage can become their most lucrative asset.
- Kenya. The allure of the 'Big Five' - lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros - and the vast, mesmerizing landscapes have drawn tourists in droves. Recognizing the economic potential, the Kenyan government has taken proactive steps to safeguard these natural assets. National parks and reserves, which now cover a significant portion of the country, not only protect the iconic wildlife but also generate substantial revenue. The revenue accrued from entrance fees, safari tours, and accommodation often goes back into conservation efforts, ensuring a sustainable cycle. Moreover, the value attached to these animals as tourist attractions inadvertently offers them a shield against poaching, as their value alive exceeds their value in body parts.


==solutions?==
It's important to strike a balance. While tourism can be a tool for positive change, it needs to be managed with care, foresight, and a genuine commitment to sustainability. Only then can the potential benefits be harnessed without compromising the delicate ecosystems that make these destinations so special in the first place.
Tourism requires effective management to become sustainable; however, without such management, it often becomes harmful to both the environment and local communities. This dependency on careful oversight means that, in its unmanaged or mismanaged forms - which are common - tourism is inherently unsustainable and damaging.
\

- **Eco-tourism**
- [Eco-tourism](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/eco-responsible-travel-our-guide-for-2024), a growing segment within the travel industry, emphasizes responsible travel to natural areas that [conserve](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/what-is-regenerative-tourism) the environment, sustain the well-being of local people, and involve understanding and education. This form of tourism encourages minimal impact on the environment while providing economic benefits to local communities. For example, destinations like Costa Rica have successfully marketed themselves as eco-friendly hotspots, where tourists can enjoy the natural beauty while contributing to conservation efforts.
- **Conservation and community-based tourism**
- Community-based tourism (CBT) focuses on empowering local communities by involving them directly in the tourism industry. This model ensures that the economic benefits of tourism are distributed fairly and that cultural and environmental integrity is maintained. By fostering a deeper connection between tourists and local cultures, CBT enhances the travel experience while promoting conservation and sustainable development. In places like Bhutan, where tourism is heavily regulated, visitors pay a sustainable development fee that contributes to the country’s conservation and cultural preservation efforts.

City taxes have become increasingly popular, with Barcelona increasing its nightly levy in April 2023 — which was originally introduced in 2012 and varies depending on the type of accommodation — and Venice expects to charge day-trippers a €5 fee from 2024.

In Amsterdam this summer, the city council voted to ban cruise ships, while the mayor, Femke Halsema, commissioned a campaign of discouragement, asking young British men who planned to have a 'vacation from morals’ to stay away. In Rome, sitting at popular sites, such as the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, has been restricted by the authorities.

And in Kenya’s Maasai Mara, meanwhile, the Narok County governor has introduced on-the-spot fines for off-roading. He also plans to double nightly park fees in peak season.

The future of tourism depends on the collective efforts of all stakeholders - governments, businesses, communities, and travelers. Policymakers must implement regulations that incentivize sustainable practices, such as carbon taxes on flights and stricter environmental standards for tourism operators. Businesses in the tourism industry must commit to sustainability, not just as a marketing strategy, but as a core operational principle. 
Local communities should be empowered to manage tourism in ways that benefit them economically while preserving their cultural and natural heritage. Travelers, too, must embrace a mindset of responsibility, understanding that every journey has an impact and making choices that minimize harm to the environment.

One of these is the [Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (GCET)](https://www.unwto.org/es), a set of general principles intended to guide tourism development stakeholders, such as governments, communities, industry, and tourists. Its purpose is to maximize the benefits for the sector and reduce its negative impact on the environment. This organization has been recognized by the United Nations since 2001.

The path forward for the tourism industry is clear: embrace environmental sustainability or face the long-term consequences of environmental degradation and climate change. By investing in green infrastructure and promoting responsible travel practices, the industry can lead the way in creating a future where tourism and the environment coexist in harmony.

fostering environmental and cultural awareness and respect, and providing positive and memorable experiences for visitors. And finally, to recognize the rights and spiritual beliefs of peoples and communities.
