**Comparison of attitudes towards wolves in Source D and Source E**

  

Both Source D and Source E explore people's attitudes towards wolves, but they do so in different ways and from different perspectives.

  

In Source D, which is a factual article, the attitudes towards wolves are shown to be varied and to have changed over time. The source explains that wolves were "viewed with suspicion, fear and even hatred" in the past, especially in medieval Europe, where they were seen as dangerous predators threatening "livestock and people." This shows that, historically, people's attitudes were very negative and based on fear, possibly due to the threat wolves posed to their livelihoods and safety. The writer also notes that wolves were "hunted relentlessly," further demonstrating the hostility people felt.

  

However, the article also points out that these negative views have "softened" in more modern times. Conservationists have played a role in educating people about the ecological importance of wolves, raising awareness of their value as "apex predators" that help maintain nature's balance. Despite this increase in understanding, Source D acknowledges that opinions remain divided. While some support wolf conservation, "some farmers have complained of livestock attacks," showing that fear and resentment still exist, especially where economic interests are involved. Overall, Source D presents people's attitudes towards wolves as complex and shaped by changing circumstances and new knowledge.

  

In contrast, Source E is a fictional account that focuses on individual experience. The narrator grew up with the same negative stories about wolves—such as stealing sheep or even attacking children—which reflects the traditional fears mentioned in Source D. However, the narrator's direct encounter with a wolf leads to a personal change in attitude; instead of seeing the wolf as "evil or monstrous," the narrator describes it as "beautiful" and "proud," and comes to feel "respect" rather than fear. The story clearly challenges the old myths and suggests that wolves are "not the villains of the old stories." The attitude here is more sympathetic and nuanced—the narrator even finds the wolf "not threatening," showing a shift from inherited fear to a more open-minded and appreciative view.

  

In summary, both sources acknowledge the long-standing fear and suspicion towards wolves, but Source D explores a broad, societal change over time while Source E shows a personal transformation. Source D is concerned with facts and general trends, highlighting both progress and continued divisions, whereas Source E uses a personal encounter to argue that wolves should be respected, not feared. Both suggest that attitudes towards wolves are evolving, but they illustrate this evolution in different ways.
