Both sources show the rapid development of Lagos from a small, under-developed village town into a bustling metropolis. Source A uses two birds-eye-view images showing the before and after of development in Lagos, with the first image showing crowded roads with crowded streets and short buildings littered on the sides. While the second image shows highways and uniform roads surrounded with districts of tall buildings as far as the eye can see. The camera angles of the images reinforced the development of Lagos, with the first image's angle positioned in a way that the short buildings blocks a lot of the view of the rest of the city, only showing a small portion of the city, while the second image is very high, showing the wide expanse of the newly expanded city. Source B shows the development by starting off with short, declarative sentences, "A city that's always changing. A place still being built.", indicating that Lagos is still developing and it is doing so fast, without stopping. Source B emphasizes the rapid positive change by informing that "Twenty million years ago, Lekki was mostly swamp, but now homes there sell for millions" and "A street you saw six months ago might look different now", using time followed by the changes to emphasize how much development has happened over the months.
However, Source B is a bit skeptical about the unnatural speed of development and decision making for development, while Source A seems to show it in a positive manner. Source B mentions that "it may be risking careful planning or long-lasting stability", suggesting that this impulsive or erratical way of city planning and development might be unseen before and never tried before, therefore might lead to problems way down the road and cause more harm than benefits. Source B also gives a specific example of an area of concern, "Eko Atlantic City, built on land taken from the ocean. But I still feel unsure. I keep imagining the sea one day coming back to take it all away", the use of the author's own opinion with the personification of the sea coming back to destroy the hard work of the Lagos people paints a vivid picture of the risks that the city may face in the future, raising concerns about the sustainability of the rapid development. On the other hand, Source A's images show a before and after effect, and the after image does not show anything bad, instead it shows fluffy clouds and clear skies over the more organized and clean city. Overall, Source A presents the development in a positive manner, while Source B commemorates and praises the development, but shows some skepticism and concerns about the development. Source B seems to implore the readers to think or raise awareness of the fact that sometimes if deterministic people go too far they might miss important details.




Source A presents before as crowded, under developed, messy districts and now...
Source B shows Lagos wants to improve, lots of shops, able to develop, good economics?

# Comparison: How Lagos is Presented in Source A and Source B

## **Source A: Textual Representation**
Source A presents Lagos as a city of **constant transformation and uncertainty**. The opening declarative sentence "A city that's always changing" immediately establishes Lagos as dynamic and unstable. The writer uses **present tense** throughout, creating immediacy and suggesting this change is ongoing and relentless.

**Key aspects of presentation:**
- **Rapid development**: The metaphor of houses that "pop up" suggests sudden, almost magical appearance of new buildings
- **Impermanence**: The contrast between what "you saw just six months ago" and "now" emphasizes the city's transient nature
- **Commercial dynamism**: The specific example of shops transforming from "fashion boutique" to "furniture store" shows economic fluidity
- **Geographical transformation**: The description of land "taken back from the sea" presents Lagos as literally reshaping itself against nature

The tone becomes increasingly **concerned and skeptical** toward the end, with phrases like "fast, restless, and never satisfied" suggesting criticism of unchecked growth. The final image of the sea "coming back to take it all away" creates an ominous sense of environmental vulnerability.

## **Source B: Visual Representation**
The two images present **contrasting visual perspectives** of Lagos:

**Top image**: Shows Lagos as a **bustling, crowded commercial hub** with:
- Dense crowds suggesting vibrant street life
- Traditional market structures alongside modern buildings
- Human-scale perspective emphasizing the city's energy and activity
- Black and white presentation giving a timeless, documentary quality

**Bottom image**: Presents Lagos as a **modern, expansive metropolis** with:
- Aerial perspective showing urban sprawl and development
- Modern high-rise buildings suggesting prosperity and growth
- Orderly infrastructure and planned development
- Broader scope emphasizing the city's scale and ambition

## **Comparative Analysis**

**Similarities:**
- Both sources emphasize Lagos's **developmental energy** and growth
- Both suggest a city of **contrasts** - old and new, traditional and modern
- Both present Lagos as **significant and noteworthy** - worthy of documentation

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Source A | Source B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Tone** | Anxious, uncertain, critical | Neutral, documentary, observational |
| **Perspective** | Personal, experiential ("you saw") | Objective, distanced |
| **Time focus** | Temporal change over months/years | Static moments captured |
| **Concerns** | Environmental risks, sustainability | Visual documentation without judgment |
| **Detail level** | Specific examples (shops, furniture) | Broad urban landscapes |

**Most significantly**, Source A presents Lagos through a **narrative of concern** about rapid, potentially unsustainable development, while Source B offers **visual evidence** of Lagos as a functioning, dynamic urban center without explicit commentary on the implications of this development.

The text creates **emotional engagement** through personal observation and worry, while the images provide **empirical evidence** of Lagos's urban reality, allowing readers to form their own judgments about the city's development trajectory.

# Inferences

**Source A suggests an insider's perspective** - someone living in or frequently visiting Lagos. The use of "you saw" and specific local knowledge (Admiralty Road, Lekki, The Island) implies **personal experience and emotional investment** in the city's future. This creates authenticity but also **subjective anxiety** about change.

**Source B implies an outsider's documentation** - likely journalistic or academic photography intended to **objectively record** urban conditions. The formal, archival quality suggests these images serve as **evidence or illustration** rather than personal expression.


**Environmental justice concerns** can be inferred from Source A's emphasis on **land reclamation** and the ominous prediction about the sea returning. This suggests Lagos's development may be **environmentally unsustainable** and disproportionately **risky for vulnerable populations**.


**Source A implies accelerating change** - the specific timeframe ("six months ago", "twenty years ago") suggests development is **outpacing human adaptation**. The reference to "swamp" being transformed into million-dollar properties indicates **massive environmental manipulation** for economic gain.

**Source B captures a moment of transition** - the coexistence of traditional market structures with modern buildings suggests Lagos is **simultaneously preserving and transforming** its urban character.


**Source A's Dubai comparison** implies Lagos is **following international development models** rather than creating indigenous urban solutions. This suggests **globalized urban planning** that may not suit local conditions.

**The environmental vulnerability mentioned** (sea reclamation, climate concerns) positions Lagos within **global climate change discourse** - as both contributor to and victim of environmental challenges.

**Both sources together suggest Lagos represents broader African urban challenges:**
- Rapid growth outpacing infrastructure
- Tension between economic opportunity and environmental sustainability
- Global investment models conflicting with local needs
- The need for development approaches that balance growth with stability

Both sources present surfing as a dangerous activity, but they approach this theme in distinctly different ways.

**Source A presents surfing romantically and atmospherically.** The writer uses sensory imagery to create an immersive scene: "The air smells a little like salt water, but much more like bonfires, diesel, and weed." This establishes surfing within a broader cultural context, suggesting it's part of a lifestyle and community. The danger is presented as alluring and legendary - "some of the world's biggest waves" and waves that "can reach 100 feet tall." The language emphasizes the epic scale and prestige of surfing at Mavericks, with phrases like "massive waves" and describing surfers who have "died here." This romanticizes the risk, presenting it as heroic rather than simply hazardous.

**In contrast, Source B presents surfing in a practical, safety-focused manner.** The danger is presented factually and clinically: "Surfing comes with risks, like any sport." The tone is instructional rather than atmospheric, using direct warnings like "You could drown if a big wave holds you underwater." Where Source A glamorizes the danger, Source B systematically lists hazards with clear explanations and safety advice: "stay calm, float with the current, then swim sideways toward the waves and back to shore."

**The purposes differ significantly.** Source A appears to be creative non-fiction that captures the culture and mystique of big wave surfing, using evocative description like "shadowy people sit quietly in the backs of pickup trucks." Source B is clearly educational, designed to inform surfers about safety: "not to scare you, but to raise awareness."

**Key inferences can be drawn from both sources.** Source A implies that surfing at this level is exclusive and elite - the reference to "Even skilled, well-known surfers have died here" suggests only experienced professionals attempt these waves. The early morning setting and "waiting for a surf competition to start" infers this is a serious, organized sport rather than casual recreation. The unpredictability described ("Just one shift in wind or tide can ruin everything") implies that surfers must be completely dedicated and flexible.

Source B infers that surfing has become more mainstream and accessible, requiring safety education for a broader audience. The phrase "Some may not apply to your local beach" suggests surfing is now practiced widely across different locations and skill levels. The reassuring tone ("surfing is still a safe and healthy activity") infers there's public concern about surfing's dangers that needs addressing.

**The language choices reflect these different purposes.** Source A uses literary techniques like metaphor ("steep, deep underwater rock formation") and creates suspense through uncertainty ("even then, the schedule can change suddenly"). Source B employs straightforward, accessible language with practical imperatives: "Just stay alert, use good judgment."

While both sources acknowledge surfing's inherent dangers, Source A presents it as a thrilling, almost mystical pursuit worth the risk, whereas Source B presents it as a manageable activity where risks can be minimized through knowledge and preparation.
