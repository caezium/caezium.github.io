Audiences in Shakespeare’s Time

  

By 1600, London theatres, like the Globe, could take up to 3000 people for the most popular plays. With several theatres offering plays most afternoons, this meant between 10,000 and 20,000 people a week going to London theatres.

  

How did the audience behave?

Some of the audience went to the theatre to be seen and admired, dressed in their best clothes. But these people were not necessarily well-behaved. Most didn’t sit and watch in silence like today. They clapped the heroes and booed the villains, and cheered the special effects. Thieves were common in the audience and sometimes fights broke out. In 1612, magistrates banned music at the end of plays at the Fortune Theatre, saying the crowd had caused ‘tumults and outrages’ with their dancing.

  

What effect did the audience have on the success of a play?

With such large audiences, plays only had short runs before they were replaced. Between 1594 and 1640 about 700 new plays were written. In the past, and the crowds, these plays often re-told famous stories from myths, the lessons of violence, music and humour always popular (and the meaning was known). At the Swan Theatre if a play, the audience let the actors know. At the Swan Theatre if the audience didn’t like a play, they drowned the actors’ words with drums and whistles. In 1629, a visiting French company was booed and pelted with apples by the audience. This was because the company used women to play female roles, something which shocked the audience. Since it was so involved in the performance of a play, the audience was vital to its success.

Should We Put Up With Disruptive Behaviour At The Theatre?

  

Audiences are increasingly fed up with bad behaviour in the theatre – and they are taking the law into their own hands.

  

Many have applauded the actions of theatre-goer, Kevin Williamson, who reacted to another audience member’s refusal to stop using their phone during the performance by seizing it and tossing it across the theatre. Others have pointed out that this in itself created further disruption, which was disrespectful to the performers.

  

In a perfect world, nobody should have to police anybody else in the theatre. Everybody should know that using mobile phones to text is as rude as talking throughout.

  

But they don’t. There are plenty of people who seem to think that they haven’t actually experienced something unless they have photographed and videoed it – and that extends to their theatre-going.

  

I’ve been to shows for under-fives where a substantial number of adults in the audience have spent the entire performance Facebooking merrily away. Theatre managers take no action, but maybe that’s because they are too busy protecting the stage from being stormed by the kids left to roam entirely free by their texting parents.

  

The situation will not improve as long as managers stand idly by. Persistent texters are allowed to type with impunity. Latecomers are admitted to seats in the middle of rows despite notices that say ‘no latecomers’. People are permitted to take lavatory breaks on a whim and are re-admitted when it suits them. And those who think the ‘no photographs’ rule doesn’t apply to them are allowed to get away with it. For as long as such leniency exists, the enjoyment of the vast majority of theatre-goers will be compromised by the rudeness of the minority.

The dangers of diving

  

Twenty years ago, I embarked on a round-the-world trip. But, when I fell in love with scuba diving, I took a job as a cook on a dive boat on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

  

After two days based at the diving school, the students would board a boat for a three-day trip. It was me they came to with their worries: ‘Are there sharks on the reef?’; ‘Are they dangerous?’; ‘Is it pitch black on a night dive?’

  

That morning on the boat, two of the instructors were going on an ‘early one’, and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. They said the best time to dive was 6am, when the fish were waking and feeding on the coral, and the sun on the water was dazzling. They were planning a short, deep dive. They were two of the most experienced divers, but also two of the most competitive. I felt slightly out of my comfort zone, so I declined. I regretted it as I watched them sink beneath the surface.

  

After such a deep dive, they should have resurfaced after 22 minutes. At 45 minutes, the remaining crew and I were anxiously scanning the water. Then somebody noticed that neither of the divers had taken their digital compasses – the instruments needed to find their way.

  

As time went by, my terror grew. We organised rescue helicopters from the mainland, while attempting to keep the potential disaster a secret from the scuba-diving students. But, after 90 minutes we had to cancel their training dive, and the leader was forced to explain the situation.

  

It wasn’t until another hour later that a passenger spotted a tiny flash of silver on the horizon. It was miles from where the divers had gone into the water. The captain went to investigate and, eventually, our divers were picked up, safe and well. Swept away by strong currents on their dive they had been unable to find the boat. The flash of silver was a watch, aimed at the sun to reflect a signal to passing boats.

  

Once back on board, they were quiet and shocked, and, while we all knew there would be a safety review by the dive company, they preferred not to speak. But I saw it in their faces: the terror of having been in the middle of the open water, small dots in a wide expanse of blue. It could have been a tragedy, but was, luckily, just a healthy reminder of the power and unpredictability of the sea and the way a flat, calm surface can mask a wild undercurrent.

The reef

The reef was a maze of beauty and danger. It stretched out for miles, its twisted branches and rocky cracks forming a landscape, which threatened visitors with jagged razor edges and hidden poisonous creatures. But despite all its dangers, the reef was a place of safety and sanctuary for those who knew how to navigate it. Schools of fish shot through the water, their scales shimmering like jewels against the vibrant backdrop of the coral. Crabs and shrimp scuttled across the sand, while starfish clung to the coral with their suctioned feet, adding to the kaleidoscope of colours and textures that made the reef a breathtaking spectacle.

Effects of Natural Disasters

  

The impact of natural disasters can be absolutely devastating and long lasting.

  

When the earthquake struck the region, everything changed in an instant. People fled from collapsing buildings, and clouds of dust choked the air. Roads split apart. Fires broke out where gas pipes burst. Survivors stumbled around in shock, trying to find missing family members.

  

Emergency services were overwhelmed. Hospitals filled within hours. Those who escaped injury still lost homes, possessions, and, in many cases, livelihoods. Entire communities were left without power or clean water.

  

In the aftermath, disease often spreads quickly in cramped temporary shelters. Children are particularly vulnerable. It can take years to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Many families are never able to return to the lives they once knew.

  

The emotional trauma is equally destructive. The fear, the grief, the sense of loss—it doesn’t vanish when the ground stops shaking.

‘The Wave’ by Morton Rhue (fictional account of a tsunami)

  

Nobody who lived through that day would ever forget it. We were in the kitchen when the roar began, louder than anything I’d ever heard. Then the water hit. It didn’t come in gentle waves like the sea usually does—it came like a wall, a monster crashing through everything in its path.

  

The house shook, the windows shattered, and we barely had time to scramble onto the roof before it was completely underwater. I remember holding onto the chimney, watching cars float by like toys. The force was unbelievable. It tore trees out of the ground like they were twigs.

  

When the water finally pulled back, it left behind silence—and destruction. Furniture, animals, broken glass, and twisted metal were everywhere. We found neighbours on rooftops, some injured, some just stunned.

  

It took days before help arrived. The roads were gone. Phones were dead. We were completely cut off. We shared whatever food we had and tried not to cry in front of the younger kids. I think that was the hardest part—trying to be strong when inside we were all falling apart.

Extract from a factual article

  

Wolves have long had a complex relationship with humans. In many parts of the world, they have been viewed with suspicion, fear and even hatred. Throughout the Middle Ages, wolves were hunted relentlessly in Europe, believed to be dangerous predators that threatened both livestock and people.

  

In more recent times, these negative views have softened. Conservationists have worked hard to educate the public about the vital role wolves play in ecosystems, particularly as apex predators that help control deer populations and maintain balance in the natural world.

  

However, not everyone supports the reintroduction of wolves. In areas where wolves have been reintroduced, some farmers have complained of livestock attacks. There is still debate over how to balance wildlife conservation with the needs of local communities.

Extract from a fictional story

  

I first saw the wolf just beyond the tree line. Its eyes were bright, alert, and unafraid. We stood frozen, two creatures curious about each other.

  

I had grown up hearing stories about wolves—how they’d steal sheep in the night or drag off children who strayed too far from the path. But this wolf didn’t look evil or monstrous. It was beautiful. Proud. Not tame, but not threatening either.

  

The wolf didn’t move until I took a step forward. Then it turned, silent as a shadow, and disappeared into the woods. I stood for a long time, listening to the wind in the trees and wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  

Since that day, I’ve never feared wolves. I respect them. They are wild and mysterious, but not the villains of the old stories.
