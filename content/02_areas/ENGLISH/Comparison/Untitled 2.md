**Model Paragraph:**

  

Both Source D and Source E explore the behaviours of theatre audiences, but they describe very different experiences in the 1600s versus modern times. In Source D, the audience at the Globe Theatre in Shakespeare’s era was lively and very involved in the performance. The text describes how they clapped, booed, and even caused “tumults and outrages” with their cheers, dancing, and sometimes even fights or theft. This level of interaction meant that the audience had a direct impact on the play’s success; if they didn’t enjoy the performance, they would “drown the actors’ words with drums and whistles” or even throw objects like apples. Source D suggests that rowdy or disruptive behaviour from the audience was common and, in some cases, even expected.

  

In contrast, Source E focuses on the modern theatre audience, where the expectation is for people to “sit and watch in silence.” Here, disruptive behaviour is seen as negative and disrespectful, particularly when people use mobile phones, arrive late, or ignore rules about photography. The source shows frustration from regular theatre-goers who feel that their experience is ruined by the rudeness of a few, indicating that the cultural norm today values quiet attention rather than active participation. The journalist complains about “persistent texters” and describes parents allowing children to be noisy, but unlike in the 1600s, these behaviours are condemned, not celebrated.

  

In summary, both sources show that disruptive or lively behaviour occurs in both time periods, but the attitude towards this behaviour has changed. In Shakespeare’s time, loud and active audiences were an essential part of the theatre experience, directly influencing the performance. In modern times, however, any disruption is considered disrespectful, and there is a clear expectation that audiences should be quiet and attentive, showing how societal values regarding theatre etiquette have changed over time.
