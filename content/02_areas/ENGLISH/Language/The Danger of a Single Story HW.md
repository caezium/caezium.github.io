1. The books available in Nigeria were mostly from outside Nigeria by authors from America and Britain, the characters were all unlike the people living in Nigeria, and she found their actions and appearances unfamiliar but interesting. After she finds books written by African authors, she discovered that literature does not only have to portray characters with the same appearance and actions as in the foreign books, widening her view.

2. A single story leads to wrong assumptions and untrue stereotypes, which leads to human beings being flattened into one trait and can also lead to unrequested patronizing. Single stories can also be repeated over and over again by different people, reinforcing the harmful stereotypes and assumptions into society.

3.  Singles stories create stereotypes that are incomplete and misleading, “it robs people of dignity” and makes recognizing “equal humanity difficult.” Adichie uses three anecdotes to show the effects of a single story. It led to silencing of possibilities for literature books, where the books available to her only showed a narrow range of character types, leading her to believe that those types of characters need to appear in any literature work. It also led to prejudice with her roommate, where based on one look her roommate thought Adichie was from an underdeveloped, tribal, luddite village. And it also led to self-shame for her Mexico trip, where she stereotypes Mexicans because of the border policies and political talks at the time and when she found out that Mexicans were not at all what she thought they will be like, she was ashamed of herself. Adichie argues that  by seeking "a balance of stories", you resist the single story, and this restores “a kind of paradise".
