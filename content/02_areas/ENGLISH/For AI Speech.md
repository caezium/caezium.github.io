Imagine this: a student spends more than 70% of their young life in school—collaborating with friends, showing creativity in projects, working hard.

And yet, on exam day, all of that learning is reduced… to a single number on a piece of paper.

Does that really sound fair? I think this sounds more and more unfair everyday as AI advances its usefulness.

In a world of emerging multimodal AI interfaces, our exam-first system is easy to game. Assistive tech is leaping ahead: Neuralink’s clinical trials now let paralyzed patients move a cursor just by thinking, and Meta smart glasses can translate speech live and answer stuff.
In 2025, the startup Cluely raised about $20 million to sell a tool that feeds you answers in real time from a hidden window, it is designed to “cheat on everything” during interviews, tests, even sales calls. 
Reporters who tried it called it slick but creepy, and universities and employers are already scrambling to detect it. 
The quote "to cheat on everything" may be left intentionally unclear. What is 'everything'? If everyone can cheat on everything, then is it cheating?
If tools can whisper answers in your ear—or straight to your brain—, if vasts amount of information can be fed directly and synthesized for you, then measuring students by closed‑book recall is measuring the wrong thing. 

Instead of forcing every student into the same standardized box we need to assess what we assess students on: judgment, critical thinking, and practical problem solving.

AI won’t make us learn less—it will make us learn _better_. No longer memorizing for the sake of tests, but mastering skills we can carry into the real world.







(steady voice, gesture outward)  
So what have we seen today? AI that saves lives in hospitals, AI that supports us in everyday choices, AI that entertains us, accelerates our work, and yes—AI that can finally rethink education itself.

(pause, make eye contact)  
The danger is not AI itself. The danger is using it carelessly—or not using it at all.

Used wrongly, AI can mislead. Used wisely, AI can empower.

(lean forward slightly, pause)  
So when we think of AI, we shouldn’t see a threat to the future—we should see a _partner_ in building it.

(final line, strong and clear)  
The future of AI will be written not by machines, but by us… if we choose to use it wisely. Thank you.
