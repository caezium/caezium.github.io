In An Inspector calls, Priestly presents Gerald Croft's attitudes towards women to reflect the broader social views in a patriarchal culture on women and moral fallings high class individuals. Written in 1945 but set in 1912, the play explores a time when women were largely viewed as inferior and possessions, and when higher classed people had more power over women, even worse if they were working class. Priestley uses Gerald to expose the exploitative behavior of upper class men towards vulnerable women, by showing how Gerald views women as objects, thinks relationships as a type of temporary business connection, and regards himself as a savior to the so called damsels in distress.

When asked about how the relationship with Daisy ended, Gerald replies with "I had to go away for several weeks, \[...] so I broke it definitely before I went", this shows how he objectifies women, and thinks they can be disposed of when they are of no value to him. This short fragment of the sentence of the breakup is said in a decisive yet casual tone with no afterthought or regret. When Gerald was  "very busy with the works", he used Daisy to seek comfort because Daisy can take him in with unconditional love, yet after the busy period came to an end and thinking about long-term profit, he turns back to Sheila whose family can give him powerful support. This is in line with the time period when the play was set, where women are possessed and expendable, especially lower class women. Interestingly, Sheila, to some extent, is also regarded by Gerald as an 'object' that can offer some use that can otherwise not be gained from a working class girl. That is why Gerald turned away from her and then came back, not out of love, but mostly a utilitarian purpose. This is one way in which Priestley presents Gerald's attitude of objectifying women.


Furthermore, Gerald thinks of relationships as a type of business connection. This is shown to the audience when he says "I broke it definitely before I went". The word "broke" implies finality and coldness, along with the diction of 'broke off', this applies to a situation where something short is easily ended, this gives off the impression of a quick cancellation of a business contract, revealing Gerald's mindset of a relationship can be 'broken off' anytime considering it is just a temporary contract. His business-oriented mindset also can be seen when he uses Daisy when he is busy so that he can receive unconditional love without any concern; on the other hand, if it was Sheila, he would have needed to put effort back in while busily working to receive the love. After using Daisy, he abandons her so that he can subsequently reap the benefits of the Birling's support. This, according to Gerald's inherent business-oriented value, could be a win-win strategy for all parties, and that is why he does not feel a lot of guilt and feels justified. Priestley critiques this mindset by reflecting how both women and emotions are commodified, and love is only valuable if it brings tangible rewards.

Moreover, Gerald's reply to Sheila "All-right I did for a time" and when Gerald also tries to 'shield' Sheila from his 'disgusting' infidelity, patronizing her shows how he regards himself as a "fairy prince", who saves the unfortunate women.  The metaphor of Gerald being a "fairy prince" shows us how Gerald justifies his exploitation by using the illusion of being the savior who first protects or saves them and therefore can dominate the relationship, or then decide to distance or get rid of them. Through this representation of Gerald's view on women, the audience can understand how deep Gerald is in his own illusion, how societal norms are deeply rooted in his mind, and empathize with how unfair Sheila and Daisy were treated. 

Furthermore, Priestley's use of dramatic irony serves to expose Gerald's hypocrisy. At the end of the play, Gerald questions and doesn't believe that the girl that the Inspector showed them were the same one and the Inspector was just talking nonsense. Priestley contrasts Gerald's stagnation with the moral awakening of characters like Sheila, his dismissal of the Inspector interrogation reveals his unwillingness to acknowledge his faults. Priestley underscores how societal change requires not only introspection, but the willingness to act and change, and how deeply influenced people, like Gerald, cannot change because of their arrogance and unwillingness.


#### Conclusion
- *conclude/restate points*
- *end with a good sentence*

In conclusion, Priestley presents Gerald Croft's attitudes towards women as expendable objects, his view of relationships as transactional, and self-perception of being a "fairy prince" to reveal the exploitative attitudes of upper-class men towards women and gender inequalities of the time. From a modern perspective, these views are not just relics of Edwardian society, but continue to resonate today. Priestly's work clearly illustrates how old societal norms, that seem to be just, ramify and shoot out into every subconscious corner of people's minds to a point of illusion, and society as a whole, even relevant now, has to receive Priestley's big call for action and act on it together.


EBI: explore the play's structure - even after all that, the ending where we see that Gerald lacked moral growth, contrasts with Sheila, how this further critiques his attitude.



### shorter version maybe
In An Inspector Calls, Priestley uses Gerald Croft to expose the exploitative attitudes of upper-class men towards women in a patriarchal society. Though set in 1912, the play, written in 1945, critiques a time when women, especially those from the lower classes, were viewed as inferior and disposable. Through Gerald, Priestley reveals how these men objectified women, treated relationships as transactional, and saw themselves as “saviors” to vulnerable women.

Priestley first exposes Gerald’s objectification of Daisy Renton. When Gerald says, “I had to go away for several weeks, so I broke it off definitely,” the clinical, decisive, and cold language reflects his detached attitude. The verb “broke” implies a quick, emotionless severance, treating Daisy as expendable once she’s no longer useful. Priestley critiques Gerald’s coldness, reflecting broader Edwardian views where lower-class women were disposable. Gerald’s lack of remorse highlights the moral corruption of his class, who use their privilege to dominate and discard women.

Gerald’s approach to relationships is also transactional. He seeks comfort in Daisy while he is “busy with work” but returns to Sheila for the financial and social benefits her family offers. This behavior mirrors capitalist values, where human connections are reduced to economic exchanges. Priestley critiques the upper class for commodifying both love and people, showing how Gerald’s decisions are driven by self-interest rather than emotional investment.

Gerald’s perception of himself as a “savior” reveals his patronizing attitude towards women. He claims to have helped Daisy because she was “young and pretty,” suggesting he views women through a lens of superficiality. The metaphor of the “fairy prince” reflects Gerald’s delusion, as he sees himself as Daisy’s rescuer when, in reality, he exploits her vulnerability. Priestley uses this to highlight the hypocrisy of upper-class men who justify their exploitation of women by casting themselves as protectors.

Dramatic irony further exposes Gerald’s flaws. Priestley contrasts Gerald’s stagnation with Sheila’s growth, showing how Gerald remains blind to his own moral failings. His refusal to accept responsibility, dismissing the Inspector’s interrogation as a “hoax,” highlights his lack of remorse and moral growth. While characters like Sheila evolve, Gerald stays rooted in his old ways, representing the resistance of the upper class to social change. Priestley’s structure—with Gerald’s stagnation set against Sheila’s development—reinforces the message that moral responsibility requires both introspection and action.

In conclusion, Priestley uses Gerald’s attitudes to reveal the exploitative nature of upper-class men, who treat women as objects and relationships as transactions. Gerald’s delusion of being a “fairy prince” exposes his hypocrisy, and his refusal to change underscores the dangers of complacency.  From a modern perspective, these views are not just relics of Edwardian society, but continue to resonate today. Priestly's work clearly illustrates how old societal norms, that seem to be just, ramify and shoot out into every subconscious corner of people's minds to a point of illusion, and society as a whole, even relevant now, has to receive Priestley's big call for action and act on it together.
