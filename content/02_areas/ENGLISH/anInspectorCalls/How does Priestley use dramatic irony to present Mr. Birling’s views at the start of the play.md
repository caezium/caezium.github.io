In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley sets his play in 1912, a pivotal moment in history, just before the Titanic sank and World War I began. This period was marked by rigid class structures, the dominance of capitalist ideologies, and stark social inequality. Written in 1945, after World War II, the play reflects Priestley’s socialist beliefs and critiques the attitudes of the upper class in Edwardian society. One of the ways Priestley conveys his social and political message is through the character of Mr. Birling, a self-assured businessman whose confidence in his views is exposed as flawed through the use of dramatic irony. Through Mr. Birling’s erroneous predictions and overconfidence, Priestley critiques capitalist individualism, arrogance, and the refusal to accept social responsibility. This essay will explore how Priestley uses dramatic irony to present Mr. Birling as a misguided and ignorant character, ultimately highlighting the dangers of such views.

In Act 1, Mr. Birling confidently dismisses the possibility of war, proclaiming, “The Germans don’t want war. Nobody wants war.” Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here is immediately evident, as the audience, living in the aftermath of two world wars, knows that Birling’s assertion is disastrously wrong. This technique exposes Birling’s ignorance and overconfidence in his understanding of global affairs. Priestley uses this irony to mock Birling’s blind faith in capitalist progress and to critique figures of authority who, like Birling, are overly confident in their flawed beliefs. Birling’s complacency in the face of looming disaster serves as a critique of the upper class, who, in their wealth and comfort, are disconnected from the realities of the world. This also connects to one of the play’s central themes—social responsibility—as Birling’s refusal to foresee war mirrors his refusal to acknowledge his own responsibility for others, a critique Priestley uses to highlight the moral failings of the capitalist class.

Mr. Birling’s infamous declaration that the Titanic is “unsinkable, absolutely unsinkable” is one of the most potent examples of dramatic irony in the play. The audience, with the benefit of hindsight, knows that the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage, making Birling’s statement not only wrong but tragically ironic. Priestley uses symbolism here, with the Titanic representing capitalist hubris—the belief that human achievement, particularly technological and economic progress, is infallible. Birling’s faith in the Titanic mirrors his faith in capitalism and the social order, both of which Priestley suggests are flawed and destined for collapse. The dramatic irony here serves to undermine Birling’s authority, casting doubt on his other views, particularly his rejection of the need for social change. By linking Birling’s confidence in the Titanic to his broader worldview, Priestley critiques the arrogance of the ruling class and their failure to recognize the need for greater social responsibility and equality, which resonates with both the play’s 1945 audience and modern audiences today.

Another example of dramatic irony is found in Mr. Birling’s dismissal of the idea that the world is on the brink of change. He states, “We’re in for a time of steadily increasing prosperity,” and confidently predicts that strikes and social unrest are unlikely. Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here reflects the audience’s awareness that the period following 1912 was marked by not only war but also significant social change, including the rise of labor movements and the eventual decline of rigid class structures. By presenting Birling as utterly blind to these changes, Priestley critiques his refusal to acknowledge the social inequalities and injustices that are soon to lead to major upheavals. This connects to the play’s broader theme of social responsibility, as Birling’s refusal to accept the possibility of change mirrors his failure to see the necessity of improving conditions for the working class. Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here highlights the dangers of ignorance and complacency among the upper classes. Birling’s blindness to the inevitable social shifts reflects his lack of empathy and understanding for the struggles of the working class, represented by characters like Eva Smith. Priestley uses this to underscore the play’s central message: the need for social responsibility and collective action. By showing how Birling’s predictions about prosperity and stability are proven wrong, Priestley critiques the arrogance of those in power who believe that the status quo will last indefinitely, while ignoring the growing demands for social justice.

Through the use of dramatic irony, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of capitalist arrogance and ignorance, whose flawed views reflect the broader failures of the ruling class in Edwardian society. By having Birling confidently make statements that the audience knows to be false, Priestley exposes the limitations of capitalist individualism and the dangers of dismissing social responsibility. Mr. Birling’s misguided confidence serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring social change and the needs of the working class. Priestley’s message is as relevant today as it was in 1945: progress and prosperity are not sustainable unless society is built on fairness, empathy, and collective responsibility.
