In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley uses the character of Gerald Croft to represent the upper-class attitudes of complacency, privilege, and superficial morality. Gerald, engaged to Sheila Birling, is a key figure in the early part of the play, embodying the social expectations and values of the aristocratic class to which he belongs. Written in 1945 and set in 1912, the play critiques the entrenched class structures and capitalist ideology of pre-World War I Britain, where people like Gerald maintained their wealth and power at the expense of the working class. Priestley presents Gerald in the early part of the play as a charming and polished young man, yet hints of his superficial morality and entitlement suggest he, like the Birlings, will be forced to confront his role in the mistreatment of the lower classes. This essay will explore how Priestley presents Gerald in the early part of the play, focusing on his charm, his attempts to maintain social harmony, and the early hints of his duplicity.

From the beginning, Gerald is presented as a charming, confident figure, well-suited to the Birling family’s upper-class circle. His engagement to Sheila is described as beneficial for both families, reinforcing the idea that Gerald’s character represents the social expectations of his class. Priestley uses dialogue to emphasize Gerald’s charm, particularly in his interactions with Mr. Birling, who views Gerald as a respectable young man and ideal son-in-law. When Mr. Birling speaks to Gerald about the marriage, he states, “Your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me,” underscoring how Gerald’s character is tied to business alliances and family reputation. Gerald’s smooth, polite demeanor reflects the way upper-class men like him are trained to project confidence and social grace. However, this charm is superficial, as Priestley later reveals that Gerald’s polished exterior hides deeper moral failings. The early presentation of Gerald as charming but shallow sets up the tension between appearances and reality, a theme Priestley explores throughout the play.

Gerald’s initial role in the play is to maintain social harmony and ease any tension, particularly between Sheila and her father. For example, when Sheila teases Gerald about his absence the previous summer, he quickly reassures her with a plausible excuse about being “busy at the works.” Priestley uses dramatic irony here, as the audience later discovers that Gerald was, in fact, having an affair with Eva Smith during this time. Gerald’s ability to deflect potential conflict with smooth explanations highlights his desire to keep up appearances and avoid uncomfortable truths. His involvement in the engagement party and interactions with the Birlings further establish him as someone who prioritizes social stability, reflecting the upper-class belief in maintaining the status quo. Gerald’s reluctance to engage with the deeper emotional and moral issues at play, even when Sheila hints at her suspicions, foreshadows the revelations that will later unravel his carefully constructed persona. Priestley uses Gerald’s character to critique the superficial values of the upper class, who often prioritize social harmony over confronting uncomfortable truths.  

Though Gerald initially appears charming and dependable, Priestley introduces early hints of his duplicity that will later come to light during the Inspector’s inquiry. Sheila’s teasing remark about his absence over the summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—reveals underlying tensions in their relationship, suggesting that Gerald has secrets he is hiding. Priestley’s use of foreshadowing here is subtle but significant, planting seeds of doubt about Gerald’s true character. While Gerald insists that he was busy with work, the audience senses that there is more to his story. Priestley uses Gerald’s initial dishonesty to highlight the theme of secrecy and deception that runs throughout the play, with the upper class often hiding their moral failings behind a facade of respectability. Gerald’s early duplicity, though not fully revealed at this point, signals to the audience that his charm and confidence may be masking deeper flaws. This tension between appearance and reality is central to Priestley’s critique of the upper class, whose wealth and privilege often allow them to evade accountability for their actions.

In the early part of An Inspector Calls, Gerald is presented as a charming and confident young man who fits seamlessly into the Birling family’s upper-class world. However, Priestley hints at Gerald’s underlying moral weaknesses, using his charm and attempts to maintain social harmony to mask his duplicity. The early scenes set the stage for the revelations that will follow, as Gerald’s polished exterior is gradually stripped away to reveal his involvement in the mistreatment of Eva Smith. Through Gerald, Priestley critiques the superficial morality of the upper class, exposing the hypocrisy and entitlement that allows them to exploit others while maintaining an appearance of respectability. Gerald’s character embodies the tension between appearance and reality, a theme that remains central to the play’s broader critique of social inequality and the need for collective responsibility.
