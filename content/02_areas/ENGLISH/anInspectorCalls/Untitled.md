The main character is **a central character who acts as the audience surrogate**—we experience the story through their eyes. The main character is involved in the story, interacts with the secondary characters, and is personally impacted by the plot's main conflict.

eva smith
even though main character, she does not speak nor act
totally conveyed through others voice
	oppressed women and lower class
result of immoral actions
	fatal impact of careless individualism and capitalistic attitudes
death to "a lot of very strong disinfectant"
	symbol of cleansing and purification, she needed to be purified.
Gerald - used when needed, objectified, "this business" "anything in return" "install her", possessive fashion as his mistress, his rescue form the bar is merely a substitution of abusers. while Eva was happy, Gerald just enjoyed his time being her knight in shining armor, convenient for him, "young and fresh"
Eric - aboose, "pretty and a good sport", objectified, "good sport" like hunting, prey, predatory nature
referred to very pretty etc, no talk about personality, objectified
poverty might not because the person was lazy or poor morals
	"good worker" "lively", wouldn't take more money good morals


the birlings arrange sheilas wedding for "lower costs and higher prices"


Priestly stereotyping upper classes


women likes superficial things see engagement ring
Sheila
ring = superficial, broke away from superficial stuff, materialistic
sheila doesnt go into geralds infidelity in beginning, better to live in ignorance and pretend there is no truth to it

gerald
ideal son in law/husband

“she was pretty - soft brown hair and big dark eyes - [breaks off] My God!”. Priestley’s use of aposiopesis (abrupt break off in speech) comes directly after Gerald describes her beauty. Therefore, revealing that Gerald only felt attracted to Eva physically as he feels the greatest grief when remembering her physical beauty.
temporary guilt
	manipulates events to alleviate

His interactions with Eva are encompassed by a semantic field of business and finance rhetoric (language), such as “Install her” “in return” “business”. This evidence shows that Gerald perceives his relationships as transactions – like his marriage. Priestley, through the character of Gerald conveys the message that money and class corrupts relationships.
	capitalistic mindset
Similarly, Gerald pursued Eva too. As did Eric, who considers women “a good sport”, objectifying women as a prize to be won.

The Inspector notes that Gerald’s kindness towards Eva separates him from the rest of the characters as "he at least had some affection for her and made her happy for a time". Yet, the help that he provided to Eva was in his own interest as he admits that he must have been a “wonderful fairy prince” to Eva.

| (cutting in) And my trouble is – that I haven’t much time. (with calm authority) | Considering the implication of sexual attack and a lack of consent from Eva, the Inspector is less stern and forceful with Eric. This could be because he recognises that Eric is a product of his parenting? |

| (very deliberately) (grimly)        | Instead of the focus on tone here, the Inspector has to repeatedly ask the same question of Mrs Birling because she doesn’t provide an answer. When he asks what Eva said, she replies to state, ‘nonsense,’ which leaves a lack of clarity around what Eva actually said, but enforces and justifies her behaviour. |

| (massively taking charge) (sharply) | The Inspector seems to be more forgiving of Gerald, which seems interesting considering that he ignores social status and hierarchy with all the other characters. It could be because Gerald, as an unreliable narrator,                                                                                            |

class
“There are millions and millions of Eva Smiths and John Smiths”
The name ‘Smith’ has its roots in the working class, originating from ‘blacksmith’, and arguably Priestley does this to demonstrate that her class is a fundamental part of her identity and origins, something that she can’t escape. Priestley uses the common name ‘John Smith’ to symbolize the universality of the suffering of the working classes, largely forgotten and neglected by the wealthy.


exploitation
"renton"
Arguably, the name “Renton” is dervived from the verb "to rent", a euphemism for prostitution in the early 20th Century. Priestley uses this change in name to mark Eva being forced to change her approach to surviving in a hostile society. She can no longer survive by working hard and therefore she must go against her own moral principles to survive, engaging in prostitution

"young and fresh and charming and altogether out of place down there".
The adjective “fresh” bears connotations of desire and fertility, demonstrating that Gerald views her with sexual intent from the start, describing her like food, an example of misogynistic objectification. Priestley also includes connotations of purity as she is "out of place", which is possibly a euphemism for her still being a virgin.


capitalism
“[With dignity] we’ve done a great deal of useful work for deserving cases”
Priestley’s use of the stage direction "with dignity" suggests that Mrs Birling’s role is not held out of care or compassion for the poor, but as a way to gain influence and status. Mrs Birling claims that the financial aid is reserved only for “deserving cases”, a decision made at the discretion of the upper classes, reflecting how the lives of the working classes are controlled by the wealthy.


"very pretty" and having "big dark eyes" // "leave after a strike" and "said something about the shop too"
Gerald tries to alleviate his and the other characters’ responsibility by claiming that Eva was many different girls, rather than the same one. This is despite him providing the evidence they were all the same when he linguistically echoes Sheila, describing Eva "very pretty" and having "big darkeyes". Furthermore, he recalls her telling him she had a job that she had to "leave after a strike" and "said something about the shop too". This makes it profoundly clear that the characters are denying the Inspector’s accusations for their own benefit – so they can continue to live their materialistic lives without taking responsibility or trying to change.
