In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley explores the deep divisions within Edwardian society, focusing on social class, inequality, and responsibility. Set in 1912, a time of rigid social hierarchy and entrenched class distinctions, the play critiques the complacency and moral failings of the upper classes. Written in 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, Priestley’s play reflects his socialist ideals and calls for a more just and equal society. In the opening scenes, the theme of social class is introduced through the interactions and attitudes of the Birling family and Gerald Croft, as well as the setting and tone of the play. Priestley uses these elements to reveal the deep-seated class prejudice and the entitlement of the upper class, while also foreshadowing the central conflict between individualism and social responsibility. This essay will explore how Priestley introduces the theme of social class in the early scenes through the characters’ language, the symbolism of the setting, and the underlying tensions between the upper and lower classes.

From the outset, Priestley presents the Birling family and Gerald Croft as symbols of upper-class privilege and entitlement. Mr. Birling is a prosperous businessman, and the family’s wealth and status are made clear through their lifestyle. The description of the family home as “substantial and heavily comfortable, but not cosy or homelike” reflects the Birlings’ social position—focused on material success rather than emotional warmth or genuine connection. Priestley’s use of stage directions here is crucial, as the setting itself becomes a reflection of the family’s social standing. The lavish surroundings reinforce the Birlings’ detachment from the struggles of the working class, who are represented by characters like Eva Smith. The comfortable environment also suggests the Birlings’ sense of security and superiority, believing their wealth protects them from any societal challenges. This sense of entitlement is directly linked to the play’s theme of social class, as Priestley critiques the complacency and self-satisfaction of the upper classes, who view their status as both deserved and unassailable.

Mr. Birling’s speeches in the opening scenes provide a clear representation of his capitalist ideology and class prejudice. He speaks with pride about his rise in society, stating, “I speak as a hard-headed businessman,” and boasts about the success of his company. Birling’s obsession with profit and his dismissive attitude toward the working class are evident when he justifies firing Eva Smith for asking for a raise, arguing that if he had given in, “they’d soon be asking for the earth.” This reflects Birling’s belief that the lower classes are not entitled to any more than they are given, and that social progress or equality is a threat to his business. Priestley uses rhetoric here to reveal Birling’s complete disregard for the welfare of his workers, positioning him as a representative of the capitalist class. Birling’s views reinforce the stark class divisions in Edwardian society, where the wealthy few held power over the many. This links to the play’s broader critique of the upper class and their failure to take responsibility for the welfare of others. Priestley’s portrayal of Birling serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the moral bankruptcy of those who prioritize profit over people.

Gerald Croft’s engagement to Sheila Birling introduces another aspect of the theme of social class: the role of marriage in reinforcing class divisions. Gerald, the son of a wealthy industrialist, represents an even higher social class than the Birlings. Mr. Birling is eager to align his family with the Crofts through the marriage, describing the engagement as a “business deal” that will strengthen ties between their companies. This emphasis on the economic benefits of the marriage rather than genuine love reflects the way the upper class uses marriage to consolidate wealth and power. Priestley uses dialogue between the characters to highlight the transactional nature of such relationships, revealing how the upper classes maintain their privileged positions by marrying within their own social circle. Gerald’s higher social standing also creates tension within the Birling family, as Sheila’s excitement about the engagement is tempered by her suspicion of Gerald’s behavior, which later reveals his affair with Eva Smith. This affair further underscores the exploitation of the working class by the upper class, as Gerald’s actions show a disregard for Eva’s wellbeing. Priestley’s critique of class is thus woven into the personal dynamics of the characters, illustrating how social divisions permeate all aspects of life.

In the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley introduces the theme of social class through the portrayal of the Birling family and Gerald Croft, their attitudes towards wealth and status, and their interactions with each other. The setting, dialogue, and characterisation all serve to highlight the stark divisions between the upper and lower classes, as well as the complacency and entitlement of the wealthy. Priestley uses these early scenes to establish the social context of the play, setting the stage for the Inspector’s interrogation, which will challenge the characters’ views on class and responsibility. Through his critique of class privilege, Priestley calls for a more equal and compassionate society, a message that resonates as much today as it did in 1945.
