In An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents Sheila Birling’s transformation as central to the play’s message of personal responsibility and moral growth. At the start of the play, Sheila is portrayed as naïve and sheltered, but as the Inspector reveals uncomfortable truths, she becomes more aware of her own actions and the world around her. By the end, Sheila has evolved into a socially conscious and self-reflective individual, embodying Priestley’s call for change in society.  

First, Priestley shows Sheila’s initial naivety and superficiality. In the opening scene, Sheila is excited about her engagement to Gerald, focusing on material things like her engagement ring: “Isn’t it a beauty?” This shows Sheila’s preoccupation with wealth and status, a reflection of her upbringing in a privileged, upper-class family. Her use of light-hearted, almost childish language reveals her immaturity, as she remains oblivious to the problems and injustices around her. At this stage, Sheila’s character symbolizes the younger generation’s initial ignorance of their societal responsibilities. However, Priestley foreshadows her potential for growth through her initial curiosity about the Inspector’s visit, hinting that she is more open-minded than her parents.

As the Inspector’s investigation progresses, Sheila begins to confront uncomfortable truths about herself and her role in Eva Smith’s downfall. After realizing she was responsible for having Eva fired from Milward’s, Sheila is deeply ashamed, admitting, “I know I’m to blame – and I’m desperately sorry.” This marks a turning point in Sheila’s character, as she moves from ignorance to self-awareness. Unlike her parents, who deflect blame and refuse to change, Sheila acknowledges her guilt and begins to accept responsibility. Priestley uses Sheila’s growing remorse to contrast with the older generation’s stubbornness, illustrating the hope he places in the younger generation to learn from their mistakes and embrace social responsibility.

By the end of the play, Sheila’s transformation is complete, and she becomes a voice of moral integrity. Even after it’s revealed that the Inspector may not be a real police officer, Sheila refuses to dismiss the lessons learned: “It doesn’t make any real difference.” This shows her newfound maturity; she understands that the moral truth of their actions remains, regardless of the Inspector’s identity. Sheila now embodies Priestley’s message of collective responsibility, urging her family to change and warning them about the dangers of returning to their old ways. Her sharp contrast with her parents, who quickly return to their selfish attitudes, highlights the divide between those willing to change and those who remain entrenched in their privilege.

In conclusion, Priestley shows Sheila’s change throughout the play to highlight the potential for personal growth and social change. From a naïve, sheltered girl focused on material concerns, Sheila evolves into a self-aware, morally responsible woman. Through her transformation, Priestley advocates for a new generation that will reject the complacency of the past and take responsibility for creating a fairer society.
