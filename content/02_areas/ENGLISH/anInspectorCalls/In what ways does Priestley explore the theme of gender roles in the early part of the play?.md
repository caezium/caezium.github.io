In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley critiques the rigid gender roles that were entrenched in Edwardian society in 1912, the period in which the play is set. Although the play was written in 1945, when ideas about women’s rights were beginning to shift, the gender norms of the early 20th century were still highly restrictive. Priestley uses the characters of Sheila Birling, Mrs. Birling, and Gerald Croft to explore how women were expected to adhere to passive, submissive roles, while men were afforded power, authority, and independence. Through these characters and their interactions, Priestley critiques the unequal treatment of women in both domestic and social spheres, while also suggesting the possibility of change through Sheila’s growing independence. This essay will explore how Priestley presents gender roles in the early part of the play, focusing on the patriarchal control exercised by men, the limited roles of women, and the subtle challenges to these traditional gender expectations.

In the opening scenes, Priestley presents a clear hierarchy of power within the Birling family, with men holding authority and women expected to remain submissive. Mr. Birling is portrayed as the dominant figure in the household, making lengthy speeches and directing conversations. His wife and daughter remain largely silent during his monologues, a reflection of the expectation that women should defer to male authority. For example, Mr. Birling dismisses Sheila’s early attempts to engage in conversation, addressing her with condescending remarks, such as “Nothing to do with you, Sheila. Run along.” Priestley’s use of dialogue here reveals Mr. Birling’s patronizing attitude toward his daughter, reinforcing the notion that women are excluded from serious matters. This reflects the broader societal belief that men were the decision-makers and providers, while women were relegated to domestic roles. Priestley critiques this patriarchal structure, exposing how it limits women’s voices and autonomy, even within their own families.

The theme of gender roles is also explored through the expectations placed on women, particularly Sheila and Mrs. Birling, in their social and familial roles. Sheila, as the young fiancée, is expected to conform to traditional ideas of femininity—passive, obedient, and concerned with appearances. She is initially portrayed as being focused on material things, as seen when she gushes over her engagement ring, saying, “Now I really feel engaged!” Priestley uses characterisation here to show how Sheila has been conditioned to value superficial markers of success and happiness, reflecting the limited scope of ambition allowed to women in Edwardian society. Similarly, Mrs. Birling’s role is defined by her position as the matriarch, whose primary concerns are maintaining the family’s reputation and upholding social propriety. She advises Sheila to “get used to” Gerald’s absences, implying that it is a wife’s duty to tolerate her husband’s behavior without question. Through Mrs. Birling’s advice, Priestley reveals the social expectation that women should prioritize their husbands’ comfort and maintain appearances, regardless of personal dissatisfaction. These expectations highlight the limited opportunities for women to assert independence or challenge their prescribed roles.

While Priestley initially presents Sheila as conforming to traditional gender roles, there are early signs that she will challenge these expectations as the play progresses. Even before the Inspector’s arrival, Sheila’s suspicion of Gerald’s behavior suggests that she is beginning to question the dynamics of their relationship. Her playful teasing about Gerald’s absence over the summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—hints at her discomfort with his secrecy, indicating that she is not entirely passive or unquestioning. Priestley’s use of foreshadowing here is important, as it signals Sheila’s potential for growth and rebellion against the gender norms that confine her. As the play continues, Sheila’s transformation becomes more apparent, but even in the early scenes, her perceptiveness and willingness to speak out against injustice set her apart from the traditional, passive female role. Priestley uses Sheila’s character to suggest that younger women, in particular, may be more open to challenging the status quo and advocating for change, aligning with the broader theme of generational conflict and social reform.

In the early part of An Inspector Calls, Priestley explores the theme of gender roles through the patriarchal control exerted by men like Mr. Birling, the restrictive social expectations placed on women like Sheila and Mrs. Birling, and the subtle challenges to these traditional roles. While women are expected to remain submissive and focused on domestic concerns, Priestley introduces early hints that Sheila, in particular, may break free from these constraints. Through his critique of the unequal treatment of women, Priestley exposes the limitations of Edwardian gender norms and suggests the potential for change, a message that resonated with audiences in 1945 and continues to hold relevance in modern discussions of gender equality. Sheila’s emerging independence foreshadows the broader social changes that Priestley advocates for, as the play’s moral lessons about responsibility and justice are closely tied to the rejection of outdated gender roles.
