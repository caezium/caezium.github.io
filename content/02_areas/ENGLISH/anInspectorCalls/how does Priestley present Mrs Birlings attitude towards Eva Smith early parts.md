An Inspector Calls, written by J.B. Priestley in 1945, is set in 1912, a period marked by rigid class divisions, entrenched capitalist ideologies, and little regard for social responsibility. The play critiques the moral failings of the upper classes, focusing on their lack of empathy toward the working class. Priestley’s socialist beliefs, shaped by the social changes that occurred after World War II, are evident in his condemnation of characters like Mrs. Birling, who represents the entrenched privilege and moral blindness of the upper class. Through the character of Mrs. Birling, Priestley illustrates the disdainful and dismissive attitudes the upper class had towards the lower class, as exemplified by her treatment of Eva Smith. This essay will explore how Priestley presents Mrs. Birling’s attitude toward Eva Smith in the early parts of the play, focusing on her lack of empathy, her sense of superiority, and her refusal to take responsibility. These attitudes are used to critique the wider social inequalities of the time and to highlight the need for social change.

In the early scenes of the play, Mrs. Birling is portrayed as a woman who lacks empathy for those of a lower social class, particularly Eva Smith. Her attitude is immediately apparent when the Inspector begins his inquiry, as she quickly dismisses the plight of Eva Smith, who represents the struggling working class. Mrs. Birling refers to Eva as “a girl of that class” in a tone that suggests disdain and distance. Priestley uses derogatory language here to reveal Mrs. Birling’s deep-seated prejudice and lack of concern for the struggles faced by the working class. The phrase “that class” dehumanizes Eva and reduces her identity to her social status, emphasizing the emotional and moral detachment of Mrs. Birling. This lack of empathy is central to Priestley’s critique of the upper classes, who, like Mrs. Birling, are disconnected from the suffering caused by their actions. This also connects to the play’s broader theme of social responsibility, as Mrs. Birling’s indifference to Eva’s plight reflects her unwillingness to acknowledge any sense of obligation to those less fortunate.

Mrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is also shaped by her overwhelming sense of superiority, both in terms of class and morality. As a member of the upper class, she views herself as inherently better than those below her, which is evident in her refusal to treat Eva Smith with any compassion or understanding. When discussing the charity committee she heads, Mrs. Birling reveals her belief that only those she deems “deserving” should be helped. She is particularly offended by Eva’s use of the name “Mrs. Birling” when seeking assistance, describing it as “a piece of gross impertinence.” Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here is important, as the audience can see the absurdity of Mrs. Birling’s indignation; the very thing that outrages her is a trivial detail, yet she allows it to justify her refusal to help a desperate young woman. This sense of superiority not only reflects the class divisions of Edwardian society but also illustrates how the upper classes maintained their power by dehumanizing and belittling the lower classes. Priestley uses characterisation to depict Mrs. Birling as a representative of the ruling elite, who views those beneath her as undeserving of respect or support. This attitude ties into the play’s larger theme of social inequality—Mrs. Birling’s refusal to help Eva shows her belief that individuals of higher status are not only socially but morally superior. This sense of entitlement prevents Mrs. Birling from seeing Eva as an individual deserving of basic dignity, which highlights the disconnect between the wealthy and the working class in early 20th-century Britain. Priestley critiques this attitude, using Mrs. Birling’s arrogance to emphasize the destructive nature of class-based prejudice and the need for social reform.

Another key aspect of Mrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is her absolute refusal to accept any responsibility for her actions. When the Inspector questions her about her role in denying help to Eva, Mrs. Birling is quick to defend herself, saying, “I did nothing I’m ashamed of.” Priestley uses repetition of Mrs. Birling’s defensive statements to highlight her deep sense of self-righteousness and her inability to reflect on the consequences of her actions. Her refusal to admit fault demonstrates her belief that her social status places her beyond moral scrutiny. This lack of accountability is crucial to Priestley’s critique of the upper class, who, in his view, exploit and harm the working class while refusing to acknowledge the impact of their actions. Mrs. Birling’s insistence that she is blameless, even after learning of Eva’s tragic fate, reinforces the play’s exploration of collective responsibility—the idea that society must work together to protect its most vulnerable members. Mrs. Birling’s failure to take responsibility is a clear illustration of the moral failings of the upper class, and Priestley uses her character to advocate for greater social responsibility and reform.

In the early parts of An Inspector Calls, Mrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is characterized by a lack of empathy, a strong sense of superiority, and a refusal to accept responsibility. Priestley presents Mrs. Birling as a representative of the privileged upper class, whose attitudes towards the working class are shaped by indifference and arrogance. Through her character, Priestley critiques the social inequalities of Edwardian society and highlights the need for compassion and collective responsibility. Mrs. Birling’s disdain for Eva Smith serves as a reminder of the dangers of moral blindness, reinforcing the play’s central message that a fair and just society must be built on empathy and social accountability—a message that resonates as strongly in today’s world as it did in 1945.
