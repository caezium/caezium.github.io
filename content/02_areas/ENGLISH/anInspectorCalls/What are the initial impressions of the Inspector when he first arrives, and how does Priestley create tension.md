In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley introduces Inspector Goole as a pivotal character who disrupts the complacent world of the Birling family. The play, set in 1912, reflects the rigid class divisions and capitalist ideologies of the time, but it was written in 1945, when the world was recovering from the devastations of two world wars. Through the Inspector, Priestley presents a moral critique of the upper classes and their refusal to accept responsibility for the welfare of others. The Inspector’s arrival marks a turning point in the play, as he challenges the Birlings’ views and forces them to confront their actions. This essay will explore the initial impressions of the Inspector, focusing on his authoritative presence, his moral purpose, and his role as a social conscience. These impressions relate to the play’s broader themes of social responsibility and justice, offering a critique of capitalist society that resonates with both contemporary and modern audiences.

From the moment the Inspector arrives, Priestley establishes him as an authoritative and commanding figure. His entrance is described as “creating an impression of massiveness, solidity, and purposefulness.” The use of stage directions here is key in conveying his physical presence and the sense that he is not easily intimidated or swayed by the Birlings’ social status. This contrasts sharply with the initially relaxed and celebratory atmosphere of the Birling family dinner, immediately suggesting that the Inspector represents a serious force. His calm, methodical questioning style furthers this impression of control, as he refuses to be rushed or distracted by Mr. Birling’s attempts to assert his authority. The effect of this authoritative presence is to unsettle the characters and the audience alike, suggesting that the Inspector has come not just to investigate a crime, but to reveal uncomfortable truths about the Birlings’ moral failures. His authoritative nature positions him as a figure of moral judgment, aligning him with the play’s broader critique of those in power who seek to avoid responsibility.

The Inspector’s dialogue is immediately marked by a clear sense of moral purpose. Unlike Mr. Birling, who speaks in terms of business, profits, and individual success, the Inspector’s language emphasizes collective responsibility and the consequences of neglecting others. One of the first things he says is that “what happened to her may have determined what happened to her afterwards.” This use of repetition highlights the Inspector’s belief in the interconnectedness of actions and consequences, introducing the theme of cause and effect that underpins the entire play. The Inspector’s moral stance is further emphasized when he reminds the Birlings, “We are members of one body,” stressing the idea of shared responsibility. This concept directly opposes Mr. Birling’s earlier speech about individualism. By presenting the Inspector as a moral figure, Priestley uses him as a vehicle to deliver the play’s central message about the need for social responsibility. This is particularly significant in the historical context of the play, written in the aftermath of World War II, when many were questioning the values of individualism and the role of collective action in rebuilding society.

One of the most significant initial impressions of the Inspector is that he functions as a social conscience for the characters. His interrogative style, asking pointed and direct questions, forces each member of the Birling family to confront their own involvement in the chain of events leading to Eva Smith’s death. The Inspector’s role is not merely to uncover facts but to encourage self-reflection and moral accountability. His refusal to accept evasions or excuses from the Birlings, such as when Mr. Birling tries to justify firing Eva, is a deliberate attempt to strip away their rationalizations and make them face the impact of their actions. The effect of this technique is to place the audience in a position where they too must consider their own responsibility to others. Priestley uses the Inspector’s character to challenge both the Birlings and the audience to reflect on their role in society, making him a powerful representation of the play’s social critique. In a modern context, this theme remains relevant as issues of inequality, corporate responsibility, and social justice continue to be debated.

In An Inspector Calls, the initial impressions of the Inspector are of a powerful, morally driven figure who serves as both a literal and symbolic force in the play. His authoritative presence unsettles the complacency of the Birlings, his language emphasizes the importance of collective responsibility, and his questioning style acts as a social conscience, challenging the characters and the audience to reflect on their actions. Priestley uses the Inspector to communicate his central message: that a just and compassionate society requires individuals to accept responsibility for each other. This message remains as relevant today as it was in 1945, as the world continues to grapple with issues of inequality, social justice, and the moral responsibilities of the powerful. Through the character of the Inspector, Priestley calls for a society built on empathy and collective responsibility, offering a timeless critique of capitalist individualism.
