In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley uses the theme of responsibility to critique the social attitudes of Edwardian Britain, particularly the upper classes’ lack of concern for the welfare of others. The play, set in 1912, reflects the rigid class structures of the time, but Priestley wrote it in 1945, following the devastation of two world wars and the rise of socialist ideals. In the early part of the play, Priestley begins to introduce the theme of responsibility by contrasting the selfish individualism of Mr. Birling with the growing moral awareness of characters like Sheila and Eric. Through dialogue, characterisation, and the dramatic entrance of Inspector Goole, Priestley gradually builds the audience’s awareness of how personal actions can have far-reaching consequences, especially for the vulnerable in society. This essay will explore how Priestley introduces the theme of responsibility, focusing on Mr. Birling’s rejection of it, the Inspector’s arrival, and the seeds of self-awareness planted in the younger generation.

In the early scenes of the play, Mr. Birling’s speeches reveal his staunch rejection of social responsibility. As a prosperous businessman, he embodies capitalist individualism, believing that success is the result of personal effort and that the well-being of others is not his concern. He famously declares, “A man has to mind his own business and look after himself and his own.” Priestley uses rhetoric here to emphasize Birling’s selfish worldview, which prioritizes profit and personal success over collective well-being. This statement is crucial in establishing the central conflict of the play: the clash between individualism and social responsibility. Mr. Birling’s disdain for the idea of collective responsibility is also reflected in his dismissive attitude towards the potential for social unrest, as he confidently dismisses the possibility of strikes and war. Through Birling’s character, Priestley critiques the capitalist class, who, in their pursuit of profit, ignore the consequences of their actions on the working class. Birling’s rejection of responsibility contrasts sharply with the moral message that Priestley will later deliver through the Inspector, foreshadowing the confrontation between the two worldviews.

The theme of responsibility takes on a new dimension with the arrival of Inspector Goole. His entrance, described in the stage directions as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness,” marks a dramatic shift in tone. The Inspector’s role is to challenge the characters’ views on responsibility, particularly those of Mr. Birling. One of the first things the Inspector says is, “what happened to her may have determined what happened to her afterwards,” introducing the idea that actions are interconnected and that individual choices can have significant consequences for others. Priestley uses dialogue to emphasize the Inspector’s moral authority, positioning him as a vehicle for Priestley’s own socialist beliefs about collective responsibility. The Inspector’s interrogation style is deliberate and methodical, forcing the Birlings to confront the impact of their actions on Eva Smith. His questioning exposes how each family member contributed to Eva’s downfall, reinforcing the play’s central message that everyone bears some responsibility for the well-being of others. Priestley’s use of the Inspector as a moral figure challenges the audience to reflect on their own responsibilities in society, aligning with the play’s broader critique of individualism and selfishness.

While Mr. Birling stubbornly rejects any notion of responsibility, Priestley begins to plant seeds of self-awareness in the younger generation, particularly Sheila and Eric. Sheila’s response to the news of Eva Smith’s death shows a stark contrast to her father’s indifference. She immediately expresses guilt for her role in Eva’s firing, saying, “But these girls aren’t cheap labour—they’re people.” Priestley uses characterisation here to present Sheila as a more empathetic and socially aware figure, reflecting the younger generation’s potential to embrace social responsibility. Eric, too, shows signs of discomfort, though his guilt and unease are initially expressed through awkward behavior rather than direct statements. The growing divide between the younger and older generations foreshadows the conflict that will unfold as the play progresses. Priestley uses this generational conflict to suggest that hope for a more responsible society lies with the younger generation, who are more open to acknowledging their moral obligations to others. This idea resonates with the post-war audience, who were grappling with the need for social change and collective responsibility in the wake of the destruction caused by two world wars.

In the early part of An Inspector Calls, Priestley introduces the theme of responsibility through the contrasting attitudes of the characters and the arrival of Inspector Goole. Mr. Birling’s rejection of responsibility reflects the selfish individualism of the capitalist class, while the Inspector’s questioning challenges this worldview by emphasizing the interconnectedness of human actions and their consequences. The seeds of self-awareness planted in Sheila and Eric suggest that the younger generation has the potential to embrace social responsibility, offering hope for a more compassionate and just society. Through these early developments, Priestley critiques the moral failings of those who prioritize profit over people and calls for a collective approach to social justice—a message that remains relevant today as society continues to grapple with issues of inequality, responsibility, and social change.
