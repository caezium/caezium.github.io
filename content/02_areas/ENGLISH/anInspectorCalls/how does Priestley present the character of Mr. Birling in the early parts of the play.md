An Inspector Calls, written by J.B. Priestley in 1945, is set in 1912, just before the First World War. The play is rooted in the context of Edwardian society, a period marked by stark class divisions, social inequality, and the dominance of capitalist ideology. Priestley, a socialist, uses the character of Mr. Birling, a prosperous businessman, to critique the capitalist class and its attitudes toward society. Through Birling, Priestley explores themes of responsibility, social hierarchy, and the consequences of ignorance. In Act 1, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of arrogance, individualism, and a refusal to accept social responsibility, reflecting the broader critique of the ruling elite and their disregard for the welfare of the working class.

In Act 1, Mr. Birling is introduced as a man full of confidence, particularly in his speeches about the future. For example, he confidently asserts, “The Germans don’t want war. Nobody wants war,” and later claims the Titanic is “unsinkable, absolutely unsinkable.” Priestley uses dramatic irony here, as the audience, aware of the historical events that follow, knows both statements are disastrously wrong. Birling’s overconfidence reveals his ignorance and lack of insight into global affairs, which makes him appear foolish in the eyes of the audience. This dramatic irony is a key technique Priestley uses to criticize the arrogance of the upper classes, who, like Birling, often make grand statements without truly understanding the complexity of the world. This not only underscores Birling’s blindness to the world around him but also ties into the play’s broader theme of social responsibility. Birling’s dismissal of future conflict and disaster represents his unwillingness to acknowledge the need for collective responsibility, a point that Priestley critiques by showing the consequences of such attitudes in history.

Mr. Birling is portrayed as the embodiment of capitalist ideology, with a strong emphasis on individual success over collective welfare. His speech about individualism—“a man has to mind his own business and look after himself and his own”—demonstrates his belief that success is earned through personal effort, with no obligation to the wider community. Priestley employs characterization to reveal Birling’s capitalist outlook, positioning him as a foil to the Inspector, who later advocates for social responsibility. This focus on individualism reflects the socio-political context of 1912, where the ruling elite prioritized profit and personal gain over workers’ rights. The Edwardian class system reinforced this, allowing figures like Birling to prosper while the working class, represented by characters like Eva Smith, were exploited. Priestley’s critique of capitalism is evident here: he presents Birling’s worldview as outdated and harmful, directly opposing the play’s call for social change and collective accountability. In modern times, this critique resonates with contemporary debates on economic inequality and corporate responsibility, making Birling’s views appear even more problematic to today’s audiences.

Throughout Act 1, Mr. Birling displays a blatant disregard for the notion of social responsibility, a key theme in An Inspector Calls. When the Inspector questions him about his role in Eva Smith’s dismissal, Birling shows no remorse, justifying his actions by saying, “If you don’t come down sharply on these people, they’d soon be asking for the earth.” This dismissive attitude towards the working class reflects Birling’s belief in the social hierarchy, where the upper class has the right to control and exploit the labor of the lower classes without question. Priestley’s use of rhetoric here highlights Birling’s complete lack of empathy. By depicting Birling as a man who cannot recognize the impact of his actions on others, Priestley critiques the moral failings of the capitalist elite. Birling’s refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for Eva’s fate contrasts sharply with the Inspector’s call for collective responsibility: “We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other.” Priestley uses this tension to advance the play’s central moral lesson—society’s future depends on individuals accepting responsibility for the well-being of others. The consequences of Birling’s refusal to change highlight the play’s message that ignoring social responsibility leads to disaster, both on a personal and societal level.

In Act 1 of An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of capitalist arrogance, ignorance, and selfishness. Through his misplaced confidence in his predictions about the future, his promotion of individualism over collective welfare, and his refusal to accept any responsibility for the working class, Birling embodies the moral and social failures of the ruling elite. Priestley’s critique of capitalism, social inequality, and the importance of responsibility resonates through Birling’s character, making him a figure of ridicule and, ultimately, a cautionary tale. The character of Mr. Birling stands as a reminder that society’s progress depends on the recognition of collective responsibility, a message that remains as relevant today as it was in 1945.
