In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley skillfully constructs a sense of mystery and intrigue from the very beginning of the play, setting the stage for the dramatic revelations to come. Set in 1912, the play begins with the seemingly happy and celebratory Birling family dinner, but from the opening scenes, there are subtle hints that all is not as it seems. Written in 1945, the play reflects Priestley’s interest in social responsibility and moral reckoning, with the mysterious Inspector Goole acting as the catalyst for the family’s downfall. Priestley builds a sense of mystery in the opening scenes through the use of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, and the sudden and enigmatic arrival of the Inspector. This essay will explore how Priestley uses these techniques to create suspense and anticipation, drawing the audience into the unfolding mystery.

The play opens with the Birling family and Gerald Croft enjoying a celebratory dinner in honor of Sheila and Gerald’s engagement. On the surface, everything appears perfect, with Mr. Birling confidently discussing the bright future ahead for both his family and his business. However, Priestley introduces dramatic irony to create a sense of unease and hint at the underlying tension. Mr. Birling’s confident assertions about the impossibility of war and the unsinkable nature of the Titanic are knowingly false to the audience, who, in 1945, are well aware of the catastrophic events that followed in the years after 1912. This use of dramatic irony immediately suggests that Mr. Birling’s worldview is flawed, creating a sense that something is about to disrupt the family’s complacent happiness. The tension between the appearance of harmony and the audience’s knowledge that these predictions are wrong begins to build the mystery, as we are left wondering what will happen to challenge the Birling family’s seemingly perfect world.

Priestley also builds mystery through the use of foreshadowing in the early scenes, particularly in the subtle tensions between the characters. Sheila’s playful teasing of Gerald about his absence the previous summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—introduces an undercurrent of suspicion. Although the family seems happy, there are hints that all is not as harmonious as it appears. Sheila’s suspicions about Gerald, coupled with Eric’s awkward behavior and heavy drinking, suggest that there are secrets waiting to be uncovered. Priestley plants these small seeds of doubt to build a sense of anticipation in the audience. These moments of tension create a feeling that something is being concealed, and the audience is left wondering what lies beneath the surface. This sense of hidden truths is crucial to the play’s development, as the Inspector’s later revelations will expose the moral failings of each character.

The mystery in the opening scenes is heightened by the sudden and unexplained arrival of Inspector Goole. His arrival is marked by a shift in the atmosphere; Priestley’s stage directions describe him as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness.” This description contrasts with the earlier lighthearted and celebratory mood, signaling to the audience that the Inspector brings with him a serious and unsettling presence. Priestley uses timing to build suspense, as the Inspector’s arrival interrupts Mr. Birling’s speech about individual responsibility, immediately challenging the values the family holds dear. The Inspector’s cryptic behavior and methodical questioning add to the sense of mystery—he appears to know more than he lets on, and his inquiries seem to suggest that the Birlings are connected to a much larger and darker story than they realize. His authority, combined with his vague and unsettling manner, builds tension as the audience is drawn into the mystery of who Inspector Goole really is and what he has come to reveal.

In the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley builds a strong sense of mystery through the use of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, and the sudden arrival of the enigmatic Inspector Goole. The contrast between the family’s superficial celebration and the underlying tension in their relationships hints at hidden secrets, while the Inspector’s presence immediately disrupts their comfortable world. Priestley uses these techniques to create suspense and anticipation, drawing the audience into the mystery of the Birlings’ connection to Eva Smith’s tragic death. This early sense of mystery is central to the play’s structure, as it sets the stage for the moral reckoning and dramatic revelations that will follow, reinforcing the play’s broader themes of responsibility, guilt, and the consequences of unchecked privilege.
