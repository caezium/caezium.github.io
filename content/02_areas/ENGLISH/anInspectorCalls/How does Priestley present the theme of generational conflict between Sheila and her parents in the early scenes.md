In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley explores the theme of generational conflict to highlight the differing values and attitudes between the younger and older generations. Set in 1912, but written in 1945, the play reflects Priestley’s desire for social change and critiques the rigid class divisions and capitalist ideologies of the early 20th century. The older generation, represented by Mr. and Mrs. Birling, is shown to be entrenched in self-interest, status, and individualism, while the younger generation, particularly Sheila, begins to challenge these traditional values. Priestley uses the tension between Sheila and her parents in the early scenes to reveal this conflict, illustrating how the younger generation is more open to change and self-reflection. This essay will explore how Priestley presents this theme through Sheila’s growing moral awareness, her rejection of her parents’ capitalist attitudes, and the subtle but growing tension in her interactions with them.

In the early scenes, Priestley presents Sheila as a character who is beginning to develop a social conscience, contrasting sharply with her parents’ self-interest. After learning about the sacking of Eva Smith, Sheila shows immediate remorse and empathy, saying, “But these girls aren’t cheap labour—they’re people.” Here, Priestley uses dialogue to highlight the emerging conflict between Sheila and her parents. Sheila’s words demonstrate her ability to see the humanity in Eva, while her father, Mr. Birling, views Eva and other workers purely in terms of profit. Mr. Birling’s earlier assertion that “a man has to mind his own business and look after himself” encapsulates the older generation’s capitalist mindset, which prioritizes wealth and power over social responsibility. Priestley uses this contrast to emphasize the growing division between Sheila and her parents. Sheila’s moral awakening, shown in her guilt and empathy, marks her as a member of the younger generation who is capable of change, while her parents remain entrenched in their capitalist values. This tension reflects the broader theme of generational conflict, with Priestley suggesting that the future lies with the younger generation’s ability to embrace social responsibility.

As the play progresses, Sheila’s rejection of her parents’ attitudes becomes more explicit, particularly in her interactions with Mr. Birling. While Mr. Birling celebrates the engagement as a business alliance with Gerald’s family, Sheila’s focus is on the emotional and moral aspects of their relationship. Sheila’s rejection of her father’s materialistic worldview is evident when she questions Gerald’s behavior during the summer, hinting at her awareness of deeper issues in their relationship beyond the superficial aspects Mr. Birling values. Priestley uses characterisation to contrast Sheila’s growing independence with Mr. Birling’s rigid views. Sheila’s willingness to challenge both her father and Gerald reflects her desire for authenticity and honesty, as opposed to the transactional nature of relationships that her parents promote. This conflict underscores the generational divide, with Sheila representing the possibility of moving beyond the class-based, capitalist structures that her parents embody. Through Sheila, Priestley critiques the older generation’s blind faith in capitalism and suggests that the younger generation has the potential to adopt a more compassionate and responsible worldview.

Priestley also introduces generational conflict between Sheila and her mother, Mrs. Birling, though in the early scenes, this tension is subtler than with Mr. Birling. Mrs. Birling is portrayed as a staunch defender of class divisions and social hierarchy, particularly in her dismissive attitude toward Eva Smith. When discussing Eva, Mrs. Birling refers to her as “a girl of that class,” emphasizing her belief that people of lower status are undeserving of help or compassion. Sheila, on the other hand, begins to distance herself from her mother’s attitudes, questioning her judgment and showing signs of empathy for Eva. The use of dramatic tension between the two women foreshadows the larger conflict that will develop as the Inspector’s questioning continues. Sheila’s moral growth contrasts sharply with Mrs. Birling’s rigid adherence to class distinctions, creating a generational divide that reflects the broader societal changes that Priestley advocates for. This conflict also highlights the theme of social responsibility, as Sheila begins to embrace the Inspector’s message of collective accountability, while her mother remains blind to her own culpability. Priestley uses this tension to underscore the need for change and progress, which he sees as being driven by the younger generation.

In the early scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents the theme of generational conflict primarily through the character of Sheila, whose growing moral awareness and empathy set her apart from her parents’ self-interest and capitalist attitudes. Sheila’s rejection of her father’s materialism and her developing sense of responsibility for others create a clear divide between the younger and older generations. The tension between Sheila and Mrs. Birling, though subtler at first, also reflects this generational divide, with Sheila beginning to challenge the class prejudices her mother holds dear. Through this conflict, Priestley critiques the complacency and moral failings of the older generation and suggests that the hope for a more just and compassionate society lies with the younger generation. This message, which resonated strongly in the post-war context of 1945, remains relevant today as society continues to grapple with issues of inequality, responsibility, and social change.
