In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley presents Mrs. Birling as a character who embodies the arrogance and moral complacency of the upper class in Edwardian society. As the wife of a wealthy industrialist and a prominent figure in charity work, Mrs. Birling is initially portrayed as self-assured, socially superior, and dismissive of those beneath her, particularly members of the working class like Eva Smith. Through Mrs. Birling’s language, attitudes, and interactions with her family, Priestley critiques the lack of social responsibility among the upper classes and their tendency to view the lower classes with contempt. In the early parts of the play, Mrs. Birling’s character is defined by her sense of superiority, her staunch defense of the class system, and her lack of empathy. This essay will explore these aspects of her character, as they reflect the central themes of class prejudice and moral responsibility in the play.

In the early scenes of the play, Mrs. Birling is presented as a woman who holds herself in high regard due to her social status. Priestley uses dialogue to convey her sense of superiority over others, particularly the working class. When discussing the events surrounding Eva Smith, she speaks with disdain, referring to her as “a girl of that class.” The use of the phrase “that class” demonstrates her belief that people from lower social strata are inherently inferior and not deserving of the same respect or consideration. This attitude is also evident in her interactions with her family; she speaks with authority and expects her opinions to be respected without question. For example, when she dismisses Sheila’s concerns or lightly scolds her for showing sensitivity, Priestley portrays Mrs. Birling as someone who upholds traditional gender roles and social hierarchy. This sense of superiority not only alienates her from the lower classes but also sets the stage for the Inspector’s critique of her moral failings later in the play.

Mrs. Birling’s prejudice against the working class is one of the key elements of her character. Priestley uses her as a symbol of the entrenched class divisions in Edwardian society, where the wealthy often viewed the poor as lazy or morally inferior. Her role as a prominent member of a charitable organization is filled with irony—though she is involved in charity work, she lacks genuine compassion for those she is supposed to help. This is evident when she says that Eva Smith, who sought help from her committee, was “impertinent” simply because she used the name Birling. This use of irony highlights the hypocrisy of Mrs. Birling’s charity work, which is more about maintaining her social status than genuinely helping those in need. Priestley uses her character to critique the moral blindness of the upper class, who, like Mrs. Birling, often refuse to acknowledge their complicity in perpetuating inequality.

Mrs. Birling’s lack of empathy is another defining feature of her character in the early parts of the play. She is shown to be emotionally detached and indifferent to the struggles of others, particularly those who are less fortunate. When discussing Eva Smith, she shows no remorse or understanding of the young woman’s plight, instead blaming her for her own misfortune. This lack of empathy extends to her family as well, as she often dismisses Sheila’s emotional responses and is oblivious to Eric’s struggles with alcohol. Priestley uses Mrs. Birling’s coldness to highlight the moral failings of the upper class, who prioritize their own comfort and reputation over the well-being of others. This attitude foreshadows her later refusal to take responsibility for her role in Eva Smith’s demise, further reinforcing the theme of social responsibility that runs throughout the play.

In the early parts of An Inspector Calls, Mrs. Birling is presented as a character defined by arrogance, class prejudice, and a lack of empathy. Through her sense of superiority, her dismissive attitude towards the working class, and her emotional detachment, Priestley critiques the moral complacency of the upper class and their failure to take responsibility for the welfare of others. Mrs. Birling’s character serves as a symbol of the entrenched social divisions of Edwardian society, and her attitudes are used by Priestley to highlight the need for greater social responsibility and empathy. As the play progresses, Mrs. Birling’s refusal to accept accountability for her actions becomes a central focus, reinforcing the play’s broader critique of the upper class and their resistance to change.
