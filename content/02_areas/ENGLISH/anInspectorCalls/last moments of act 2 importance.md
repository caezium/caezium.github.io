in the final moments of act 2, Mrs. Birling finally reveals and admits that Eva Smith was pregnant and she refused to help her. Then the dramatic twist plays out -- Eric is the father of Eva's unborn child -- heightening the tension and shock for both the characters and audience.

These last moments of act 2 are really important to the whole play as it is the climax of the play.

In these moments, we are shown that although Mrs. Birling runs a charity organization, she still brings prejudice and first impressions into who she wants to help, showing her lack of empathy (coldness) and upper-class attitude. Blaming the victim and holding a different standard for her own family. denial of responsibility moral hypocrisy

The twist totally transforms Eva's tragedy from partially or a little bit of the Birlings' fault to someone whose life was directly destroyed by the actions of the Birlings. This clearly conveys the themes of responsibility and interconnectedness of the play.

This collective guilt that has been accumulated also sets up for the moral message that will be to come.

Readers response: interconnectedness of people, the wide-seen social tragedy happens a lot and it is not a single family’s fault, its everyone’s fault. We as society have to work forward for social change. Ignorance, arrogance and selfishness have real consequences. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.

Readers response: interconnectedness of people, the commonly seen social tragedies (although existing in a variety but almost, but not quite, entirely not unlike one another) happen a lot and it is not a single family’s fault, its everyone’s fault.
