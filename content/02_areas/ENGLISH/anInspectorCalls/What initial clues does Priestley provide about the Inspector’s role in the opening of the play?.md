In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley introduces Inspector Goole as a central figure whose purpose extends beyond a traditional police investigation. From his first appearance, Priestley subtly signals that the Inspector is more than a mere detective—he represents a moral force, intent on exposing the moral failings of the Birling family and holding them accountable for their actions. Set in 1912, the play critiques the class inequalities and moral complacency of the Edwardian era, and the Inspector serves as the vehicle for this critique. Priestley uses clues such as the Inspector’s timing, his authoritative presence, and the tone of his questioning to indicate that his role is not just to gather facts, but to act as a moral judge, forcing the characters to confront their own guilt. This essay will explore the initial clues that Priestley provides about the Inspector’s true role, focusing on his entrance, his methodical questioning, and his symbolic presence.

One of the first clues about the Inspector’s role comes with the timing of his entrance. Priestley carefully orchestrates his arrival to coincide with a moment when Mr. Birling is delivering a speech about individual responsibility and capitalist values. Mr. Birling dismisses the idea of social responsibility, proclaiming, “A man has to make his own way—has to look after himself—and his family too, of course.” Just as he finishes this assertion, the doorbell rings, signaling the Inspector’s arrival. This timing is not coincidental; it is a deliberate interruption of Birling’s capitalist rhetoric. Priestley uses dramatic timing to suggest that the Inspector’s purpose is to challenge Birling’s worldview and introduce a more socially responsible perspective. The Inspector’s entrance is thus a symbolic one, marking the moment when the family’s comfortable illusions will begin to unravel. His arrival at this specific moment signals that his role is to question not only the characters’ actions but also their moral beliefs.

Another early clue about the Inspector’s role lies in the way Priestley describes his physical presence. The stage directions describe him as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness.” Despite not being physically imposing, the Inspector exudes authority and control, unsettling the characters from the moment he arrives. Priestley’s use of stage directions emphasizes the Inspector’s otherworldly or symbolic nature, suggesting that he is more than just a detective following procedure. His calm but firm demeanor contrasts with the Birlings’ initial sense of security, as he quickly establishes dominance in the room. This shift in power dynamics hints that the Inspector is there to hold the family accountable for more than just their involvement in a single event. His purpose seems to be to probe deeper into their consciences and force them to confront their moral failings. This authoritative presence sets the tone for the rest of the play, where the Inspector’s role as a moral judge becomes increasingly clear.

The Inspector’s methodical and purposeful questioning also provides early clues about his role. Unlike a typical investigator, who might focus solely on the facts of the case, the Inspector’s questions seem designed to reveal the moral culpability of each character. For example, when he asks Mr. Birling about his decision to fire Eva Smith, he does not focus on the legality of the action but rather on its ethical implications. The Inspector states, “What happened to her then may have determined what happened to her afterwards,” emphasizing the chain of consequences that led to Eva’s death. Priestley uses dialogue here to highlight the Inspector’s focus on cause and effect, suggesting that he is more interested in exposing the characters’ collective responsibility than in assigning individual blame for specific actions. The tone of his questioning, which is calm but insistent, creates an atmosphere of moral scrutiny, where the characters are forced to reflect on the broader impact of their actions. This early emphasis on moral responsibility, rather than legal guilt, signals that the Inspector’s role is to deliver a moral judgment on the Birlings and Gerald, rather than merely solve a crime.

In the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley provides several key clues about the Inspector’s true role, signaling that he is more than a conventional detective. His timely entrance, authoritative presence, and morally focused questioning all suggest that he serves as a symbolic force, intent on exposing the moral failings of the Birling family and forcing them to confront their collective responsibility. The Inspector’s role as a moral judge becomes increasingly clear as the play progresses, but Priestley’s careful construction of the character’s entrance and early interactions sets the stage for this revelation. Through the Inspector, Priestley critiques the capitalist and individualistic values of the upper class, emphasizing the importance of social responsibility—a message that resonates as strongly today as it did when the play was written.
