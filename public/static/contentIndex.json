can be measured using a stopwatch or stopclock which are usually accurate to one or two decimal places\n\n\nThe units of time normally used are seconds or minutes\n\nOther units may be used for extremely slow reactions (e.g. rusting)\n\n\n\nRemember: 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n\nExaminer Tips and Tricks\nCareful: Units of time often cause issues in results tables.\nIf the display on a stopwatch showed 1:30.\n\n\nThe incorrect time to record would be 1.30 minutes.\n\n\nThe correct time would be 1.5 minutes.\n\n\nTo avoid any confusion, if the time intervals are less than a minute, it is best / easire to change the recorded units to seconds.\n\nSo, the same stopwatch display would be recorded as 90 seconds.\n\nTemperature\n\nTemperature is measured with a thermometer or digital temperature probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory thermometers usually have a precision of a half or one degree\n\nDigital temperature probes are available which are more precise than traditional thermometers and can often read to 0.1 oC\n\n\n\nTraditional thermometers rely upon the uniform expansion and contraction of a liquid substance with temperature\n\nDigital temperature probes can be just as, if not, more accurate than traditional thermometers\n\n\n\nThe units of temperature are degrees Celsius (ºC)\n\n\nMass\n\n\nMass is measured using a digital balance which normally gives readings to two decimal places\n\n\nBalances should be tared (set to zero) before use\n\n\nBalances should also be allowed time to settle on a final measurement / reading before it is recorded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard unit of mass in kilograms (kg)\n\nHowever, in chemistry grams (g) are most often used\n\n\n\nRemember: 1 kilogram = 1000 grams\n\n\nVolumes of liquid\n\n\nThe volume of a liquid can be determined using different pieces of apparatus\n\nThe choice of apparatus depends on the level of accuracy needed\n\n\n\nThree common pieces of apparatus for measuring the volume of a liquid are:\n\n\nBurettes\n\n\nVolumetric pipettes\n\n\nMeasuring cylinders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurettes are the most accurate way of measuring a variable volume of liquid between 0 cm3 and 50 cm3\n\n\nThey are most commonly used in titrations\n\n\nCareful: Read the burette scale from top to bottom as 0.00 cm3 is at the top of the column\n\n\n\n\nVolumetric pipettes are the most accurate way of measuring a fixed volume of liquid,\n\n\nThey have a scratch mark on the neck which is matched to the bottom of the meniscus to make the measurement\n\n\nA pipette filler is used to draw the liquid into the volumetric pipette\n\n\nThe most common volumes for volumetric pipettes are 10 cm3 and 25 cm3\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring cylinders are used when approximate volumes are required (accuracy is not an important factor)\n\n\nThese are graduated (have a scale so can be used to measure)\n\n\nMeasuring cylinders typically range from 10 cm3 to 1 litre (1 dm3)\n\n\n\n\nWhichever apparatus you use, you may see markings in millilitres, ml, which are the same as a cm3\n\n\nVolumes of gas\n\n\nFor some experiments, the volume of a gas produced needs to be measured\n\n\nThis is typically done by using one of the following methods:\n\n\nUsing a gas syringe \n\n\nBy downward displacement of water\n\n\n\n\nA gas syringe is more precise and accurate than downward displacement of water\n\n\n\nDiagram of the set-up for an experiment involving a gas syringe\n\n\nDownward displacement of water is where a measuring cylinder is inverted in water to collect the gas produced\n\nThis method does not work if the gas is soluble in water\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the set-up for an experiment collecting gas by downward displacement of water\n\nIf the gas happens to be heavier than air and is coloured, the cylinder does not need to be inverted\n\nAdvantages &amp; disadvantages of methods &amp; apparatus\n\n\nIn the lab, we often have choices of different apparatus to do the same job\n\n\nEvaluating which piece of apparatus is the best one to use is part of good experimental planning and design\n\n\nThis means appreciating some of the advantages and disadvantages of laboratory apparatus\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of lab apparatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparatusAdvantageDisadvantageTemperature probe- More precise readings    - Easy to make multiple repeat readings    - Can be automated to run over long periods of time- Can be corroded by some reagents        - More expensive (to replace)Volumetric pipette- Accurate measurement of a fixed volume- Harder to use than a normal pipette    - Only measures one fixed volumeGas syringe- Easy to set up    - Keeps the gas dry- The syringe can stick    - Collects limited volumes    - Expensive and delicate / fragileMicroscale experiments- Less wasteful    - Saves energy    - Safer- Hard to see what’s happening    - Lose a lot of material separating / purifying the products\n\nFive pieces of apparatus that can be used to measure the volume of a liquid. They all have their pros and cons\nPlanning your method\n\n\nGood experimental design includes the answers to questions like\n\n\nHave I chosen a suitable apparatus for what I need to measure?\n\n\nIs it going to give me results in an appropriate time frame?\n\n\nIs it going to give me enough results to process, analyse and make conclusions?\n\n\nDoes it allow for repetitions to check how reliable my results are?\n\n\nDoes my plan give a suitable range of results?\n\n\nHow can I be sure my results are accurate?\n\n\nHave I chosen an appropriate scale of quantities without being wasteful or unsafe?\n\n\n\n\nYou may be asked about experimental methods in exam questions and your experience and knowledge of practical techniques in chemistry should help you to spot mistakes and suggest improvements\n\n"},"02_areas/CHEM/00_MOC":{"title":"00_MOC","links":["02_areas/CHEM/1/00_MOC","02_areas/CHEM/2/00_MOC","02_areas/CHEM/3/00_MOC","02_areas/CHEM/7/00_MOC","02_areas/CHEM/12/00_MOC"],"tags":[],"content":"States of Matter\n00_MOC\nAtoms, Elements, and Compounds\n00_MOC\nStoichiometry\n00_MOC\nAcids, Bases, and Salts\n00_MOC\nExperimental techniques and chemical analysis\n00_MOC"},"02_areas/CHEM/1/00_MOC":{"title":"00_MOC","links":["02_areas/CHEM/1/Solids,-Liquids,-and-Gases","02_areas/CHEM/1/attachments/013eaf74b39d9168360d103b3cd47802_MD5.jpeg","02_areas/CHEM/1/Diffusion","02_areas/CHEM/1/attachments/937a901fe5a2ab0d0f594517ae7cd785_MD5.jpeg"],"tags":[],"content":"States of Matter\n\n1.1 Solids, Liquids, and Gases\nOpen: image.png\n\n\n\n1.2 Diffusion\nOpen: image.png\n\nDiffusion\nThe movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nmore temp also means faster rate of diffusion because particles move faster\ngases with a lower molecular mass diffuse faster than those with higher molecular masses.\n"},"02_areas/CHEM/1/Atoms":{"title":"Atoms","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Atoms are building blocks of matter.

The mixture is heated until it reaches 78 ºC, at which point the ethanol boils and distills out of the mixture and condenses into the beaker\n\n\nWhen the temperature starts to increase to 100 ºC heating should be stopped. Water and ethanol are now separated\n\n\nFractional Distillation Diagram\n\nSeparation of a mixture of ethanol and water is best achieved by fractional distillation when the two components are close together in boiling point or there are multiple components\n\n\nAn electric heater is safer to use when there are flammable liquids present\n\n\nThe separation of the components in petroleum is achieved by fractional distillation on an industrial scale\n\n\nFractional distillation of crude oil is not carried out in school laboratories due to the toxic nature of some of the components of the crude oil, but it can sometimes be simulated using a synthetic crude oil made specially for the demonstration\n\n\nPaper Chromatography\n\n\nThis technique is used to separate substances that have different solubilities in a given solvent (e.g. different coloured inks that have been mixed to make black ink)\n\n\nA pencil line is drawn on chromatography paper and spots of the sample are placed on it.

atoms\n\n\n\n\nCovalent bonding occurs between two non-metals\n\n\nA covalent bond involves the electrostatic attraction between nuclei of two atoms and the electrons of their outer shells\n\n\nNo electrons are transferred but only shared in this type of bonding\n\n\nWhen a covalent bond is formed, two atomic orbitals overlap and a molecular orbital is formed\n\n\nCovalent bonding happens because the electrons are more stable when attracted to two nuclei than when attracted to only one\n\n\n\nSharing electrons in the covalent bond allows each of the 2 atoms to achieve an electron configuration similar to a noble gas\n\nThis makes each atom more stable\n\n\n\nThe octet rule refers to the tendency of atoms to gain a valence shell with a total of 8 electrons\n\n\nLewis Formulas\nDot and cross way\n\n\nCovalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules or giant molecules\nWhen two or more atoms are covalently bonded together, we describe them as ‘molecules’\n\nSimple Molecules\n\n\nSimple molecular structures have covalent bonds joining the atoms together, but intermolecular forces that act between neighboring molecules are weak\n\n\nThey have relatively low melting and boiling points because: \n\nThere are weak intermolecular forces between the molecules\nThese forces require little energy to overcome \n\n\n\nMost simple molecular structures are either gases or liquids at room temperature \n\n\nThey can be solids with low melting and boiling points but this is less common\n\n\nAs the molecules increase in size, the melting and boiling points generally increase because the strength of these intermolecular forces increases and so more energy is needed to break them \n\n\nSimple molecular structures are poor conductors of electricity (even when molten) because:\n\nThere are no free ions or electrons to move and carry the charge.\nMost covalent compounds do not conduct at all in the solid state and are thus insulators\nCommon insulators include the plastic coating around household electrical wiring, rubber and wood\n\n\n2.6 Giant Covalent Structures\nOpen: image.png\n\n\n\nGiant covalent structures are solids with high melting points\n\n\nThey have a huge number of non-metal atoms bonded to other non-metal atoms via strong covalent bonds\n\n\nThese structures can also be called giant lattices and have a fixed ratio of atoms in the overall structure\n\n\nThree examples include diamond, graphite and C60 fullerene\n\n\nAll giant covalent structures have high melting points because\n\nThere are strong covalent bonds between atoms\nThese require lots of energy to overcome\n\n\n\nGraphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene and graphene are allotropes of

called subatomic particles\nThese subatomic particles are so small that it is not practical to measure their masses and charges using conventional units (such as grams or coulombs)\nInstead, their masses and charges are compared to each other, and so are called ‘relative atomic masses’ and ‘relative atomic charges’\nThese are not actual charges and masses, but rather charges and masses of particles relative to each other\n\nProtons and neutrons have a very similar mass, so each is assigned a relative mass of 1\nElectrons are 1836 times smaller than a proton and neutron, and so their mass can be considered negligible\nProton/Atomic Number: Number of Protons\nRelative Atomic Mass: Number of Protons + Neutrons\n\nNumber of neutrons = mass number - atomic number\n\n\n\nWhere are the subatomic particles located?\n\n\nAtoms contain a positively charged, dense nucleus\n\nThe nucleus is positively charged due to the protons\nThe nucleus is dense because mass of an atom is concentrated in the nucleus, which contains the heaviest subatomic particles\nThe subatomic particles in the nucleus can generally be called nucleons, although they are specifically the neutrons and protons\n\n\n\nNegatively charged electrons occupy the space outside the nucleus\n\nThey can be described as orbiting the nucleus where they create a ‘cloud’ of negative

crystallised salt that contains water molecules as part of its structure\n\n\nThe formula of a hydrated salt shows the water molecules, e.g. CuSO4•2H2O\n\nThe • symbol shows that the water present is water of crystallisation\n\n\n\nThe formula of hydrated salts can be determined experimentally by:\n\n\nWeighing a sample of the hydrated salt\n\n\nHeating it until the water of crystallisation has been driven off\n\nThis is achieved by heating until a constant mass\n\n\n\nRe-weighing the anhydrous salt\n\n\n\n\nFrom the results, you can determine the mass of anhydrous salt and the mass of the

nothing else mixed with it\n\n\nOften, the product you are trying to obtain may become contaminated with unwanted substances such as unreacted reactants, catalysts and other impurities\n\n\nTo equation to calculate percentage purity is:\n\n\npercentage purity = \n\nPercentage yield\n\n\nYield is the term used to describe the amount of product you get from a reaction\n\n\nFor economic reasons, the objective of every chemical producing company is to have as high a percentage yield as possible to increase profits and reduce costs and waste\n\n\nIn practice, you never get 100% yield in a chemical process for several reasons\n\n\nThese include:\n\n\nSome reactants may be left behind in the equipment\n\n\nThe reaction may be reversible and in these reactions a high yield is never possible as the products are continually turning back into the reactants\n\n\nSome products may also be lost during separation and purification stages such as filtration or distillation\n\n\nThere may be side reactions occurring where a substance reacts with a gas in the air or an impurity in one of the reactants\n\n\nProducts can also be lost during transfer from one container to another\n\n\n\n\nHow to calculate percentage yield\n\n\nPercentage yield compares the actual yield to the theoretical yield\n\n\nThe equation for percentage yield is:\n\n\npercentage yield = \n\n\nActual yield is the recorded amount of product obtained\n\n\nTheoretical yield is the amount of product that would be obtained under perfect practical and chemical conditions\n\nTypically, this involves a reacting mass calculation based on the balanced symbol equation\n\n\n\n\nHow to calculate percentage composition by mass \n\n\nThe percentage composition of any compound is a way to express the mass of each element as a percentage of the total mass of the compound\n\n\nThe equation for percentage composition is:\n\n\npercentage composition of an element = \n\n\nFor example, in water:\n\n\nWater is a simple molecule with the chemical formula H2O\n\n\nSo, water is made of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom\n\n\nFrom the Periodic Table, the relative atomic mass of:\n\n\nHydrogen = 1\n\n\nOxygen = 16\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the total mass of water is:\n\n(2 × 1) + 16 = 18\n\n\n\nTo find the percentage composition of hydrogen:\n\nPercentage of hydrogen = \n\n\n\n × 100 = 11.1%\n\n\nSimilarly, the percentage composition of oxygen is:\n\nPercentage of oxygen = \n\n\n\n × 100 = 88.9%\n\nNote: The total percentage by mass of all the elements should add up to 100%, e.g. 11.1% + 88.9% = 100%\n"},"02_areas/CHEM/6/00_MOC":{"title":"00_MOC","links":["02_areas/CHEM/6/Redox"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n6.4 Redox\n\nIdentify redox reactions by the color

They help track electron transfers in redox reactions.\nRules for Assigning Oxidation States:\nRule 1: Free elements have oxidation number of 0 (e.g., Na, Fe, O₂, Cl₂)\nRule 2: For monatomic ions, the oxidation number equals the charge (e.g., Na⁺ = +1, Cl⁻ = -1)\nRule 3: Oxygen typically has -2 (except in peroxides = -1)\nRule 4: Hydrogen typically has +1 (except in metal hydrides = -1)\nRule 5: The sum of all oxidation numbers in a compound equals the overall charge\n\n\n\nWhat is a redox reaction?\n\n\nA redox reaction is where oxidation and reduction take place together at the same time in the same reaction\n\n\nIn terms of oxygen:\n\n\nOxidation is where oxygen is added to an element or a compound\n\n\nReduction is where oxygen is removed from an element or compound\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction between zinc oxide and carbon is an example of a redox reaction\n\n\nZinc oxide is reduced because it has lost oxygen\n\n\nCarbon is oxidised because it has gained oxygen\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth reduction and oxidation has occurred in this reaction so it is classed as a redox reaction\n\nOxidation and reduction - oxygen or electrons?\nThe terms ‘oxidation’ and ‘reduction’ can be a bit confusing, because we can describe them in terms of the gain / loss of oxygen, or the gain / loss of electrons.\nIn terms of oxygen: oxidation is the gain of oxygen, and reduction is the loss of oxygen.\nFor electrons it’s the opposite way around.

water\n\n\nThe more reactive metals will react with cold water to form a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas\n\n\nPotassium, sodium and calcium all undergo reactions with cold water as they are the most reactive metals:\n\n\nmetal + water →  metal hydroxide + hydrogen\n\n For example, calcium and potassium:\n\nCa (s) + 2H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n2K (s) + 2H2O (l) → 2KOH (aq) + H2 (g)\nReactions of metals with steam\n\nMetals just below calcium in the reactivity series do not react with cold water but will react with steam to form a metal oxide and hydrogen gas, for example, magnesium:\n\nMg (s) + H2O (g)  →  MgO (s) + H2 (g)\nReaction with dilute acids\n\n\nOnly metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series will react with dilute acids\n\n\nUnreactive metals below hydrogen, such as gold, silver and copper, do not react with acids\n\n\nThe more reactive the metal then the more vigorous the reaction will be\n\n\nMetals that are placed high on the reactivity series such as potassium and sodium are very dangerous and react explosively with acids\n\n\nWhen acids react with metals they form a salt and hydrogen gas:\n\n\nThe general equation is:\n\n\nmetal +

oxygen\n\n\nSome reactive metals, such as the alkali metals, react easily with oxygen\n\n\nSilver, copper and iron can also react with oxygen although much more slowly\n\n\nWhen metals react with oxygen a metal oxide is formed, for example, copper:\n\n\nmetal + oxygen → metal oxide \n2Cu (s) + O2 (g) → 2CuO (s)\n\nGold does not react with oxygen\n\nDeducing the order of reactivity\n\n\nThe order of reactivity of metals can be deduced by making experimental observations of reactions between metals and water, acids and oxygen\n\n\nThe more vigorous the reaction of the metal, the higher up the reactivity series the metal is\n\n\nA combination of reactions may be needed, for example, the order of reactivity of the more reactive metals can be determined by their reactions with water\n\n\nThe less reactive metals react slowly or not at all with water, so the order of reactivity would need to be determined by observing their reactions with dilute acid\n\n\nTemperature change in a reaction can also be used to determine the order of reactivity\n\n\nThe greater the temperature change in a reaction involving a metal, the more reactive the metal is\n\n\n\nExplaining reactivity\nExtended tier only \n\n\nMetal atoms form positive ions by loss of electrons when they react with other substances\n\n\nThe tendency of a metal to lose electrons is a measure of how reactive the metal is\n\n\nA metal that is high up on the series loses electrons easily and is thus more reactive than one which is lower down on the series\n\n\nDisplacement reactions between metals and aqueous solutions of metal salts\n\n\nAny metal will displace another metal that is below it in the reactivity series from a solution of one of its salts\n\n\nThis is because more reactive metals lose electrons and form ions more readily than less reactive metals, making them better reducing agents\n\n\nThe less reactive metal is a better electron acceptor than the more reactive metal, thus the less reactive metal is reduced \n\nOILRIG: reduction is gain of electrons\n\n\n\nMagnesium + copper sulfate\n\n\nMagnesium is a reactive metal and can displace copper from a copper sulfate solution\n\n\nMagnesium loses its electrons more easily and the ion of the less reactive metal, copper, will gain these electrons to form elemental copper\n\n\nThis is easily seen as the more reactive metal slowly disappears from the solution, displacing the less reactive metal\n\n\nmagnesium + copper sulfate → magnesium sulfate + copper\nMg (s) + CuSO****4 (aq) → MgSO****4 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\n\nThe

TOCS\ndraft2\ndraftthoughts\n\n好的，我已经看过了你提供的链接。我会参考里面的角色译名来进行翻译，以确保准确性。\n这是翻译并整理后的内容：\n第一部分\n耐儿和她外祖父的逃亡（第1-23章）\n哪个场景/事件给你留下了最深刻的印象（最少200字）\n迪克离开后，吉特赶到并与汤姆·斯科特打斗，救下了耐儿的金翅雀——奎尔普和汤姆本打算杀死它。基特把鸟带回了家。\n第14章讲述了基特为了购买鸟食和生活必需品而寻找工作。他遇到了加兰夫妇，一对老年夫妇，他们的马很倔强。基特主动提出在他们拜访公证人威特顿先生时帮忙照看马匹。加兰德夫妇和威特顿先生讨论了他们的儿子亚伯，并签署了由公证人办事员查克斯特先生见证的法律文件。加兰夫妇多付了基特照看马匹的报酬，他同意日后通过工作来抵偿差额。基特现在有能力为家人和鸟儿提供更多东西了，他乐观地希望耐儿和她的外祖父可能在他家里。\n你喜欢它吗（最少200字）\n此外，从第1-3章的第一人称叙述者到第4章开始的第三人称全知视角，叙事视角的转变极大地增强了故事性。这种更广阔的视角是许多维多利亚时代小说的特点，它允许作者同时探索多条情节线，深入探究不同角色的思想和动机（如奎尔普的恶意或加兰夫妇的仁慈），并通过展现更广泛的社会层面来进行社会评论。它使读者能够同时关注耐儿和她外祖父的逃亡、奎尔普的阴谋以及基特命运的发展，从而创造出比单一视角所能达到的更丰富、更复杂的叙事织锦。\n你认为接下来会发生什么（最少200字）\n根据已确立的轨迹，我预计会有几个发展。耐儿和她的外祖父将继续他们艰难的逃亡之旅。他们的道路很可能充满艰辛，他们会遇到各种各样的人——有些人可能会提供短暂的善意，另一些人则可能试图利用他们的脆弱。外祖父的赌瘾仍然是一个重大的弱点；尽管他爱耐儿，但如果机会出现，他很有可能再次屈服于诱惑，从而进一步危及他们。\n与此同时，奎尔普无疑会对他们的逃脱感到愤怒，并很可能会利用他所有的资源，包括唯唯诺诺的布拉斯先生，来追踪他们。他不是一个会轻易放弃感知到的债务或折磨机会的角色。他的追捕将对耐儿和她外祖父寻求安全的努力构成持续的、具有威胁性的阴影。\n基特的故事则有望出现更积极的转折。他在加兰夫妇家的工作似乎将变得更加稳定。他固有的善良和勤奋很可能会使这对善良的夫妇更加喜爱他。我预测基特不会忘记耐儿，并将积极尝试打听她的消息，甚至可能利用他新获得的稳定生活来帮助搜寻。现在由他照料的金翅雀将不断提醒他这位朋友。查克斯特先生的嫉妒可能会给基特带来一些轻微的工作场所冲突，但这不太可能影响加兰夫妇对他的赏识。\n第二部分\n追捕与苦难（第24-53章）\n现在出现了哪些角色？\n主要角色有：\n\n耐儿·特兰特：善良、温柔的13岁女主角。\n耐儿的外祖父：古玩店店主，深爱耐儿。\n克里斯托弗（基特）·纳布尔斯：忠诚、善良的男孩，为耐儿的外祖父工作。\n丹尼尔·奎尔普：残忍、善于操纵的侏儒，主要反派。\n理查德（迪克）·斯威夫勒：异想天开、心地善良的年轻人，弗雷德·特兰特的朋友。\n萨普森·布拉斯：肆无忌惮的律师，奎尔普的同伙。\n萨拉（萨丽）·布拉斯：萨普森精明的妹妹兼法律合伙人。\n贝齐·奎尔普：奎尔普胆小的妻子。\n吉尼文太太：贝齐·奎尔普专横的母亲。\n汤姆·斯科特：“翻跟斗的男孩”，奎尔普的仆人。\n纳布尔斯太太：基特勤劳、慈爱的母亲。\n雅各布·纳布尔斯和小纳布尔斯：基特的弟弟们。\n加兰先生：善良、跛足的老绅士。\n加兰太太：他开朗的妻子。\n亚伯·加兰：他们安静、尽职的儿子。\n威特顿先生：公证人，加兰夫妇的朋友。\n查克斯特先生：威特顿事务所的办事员。\n芭芭拉：加兰家的女仆，基特的恋人。\n白维斯·马克斯：神秘的“单身绅士”（后揭示为耐儿的舅公）。\n女侯爵（索福罗尼亚·斯芬克斯）：布拉斯家受忽视的女仆（她的真名后来揭晓）。\n\n哪一个给你留下了最好的印象？\n迪克·斯威夫勒\n分析这个角色的特点（最少200字）\n理查德“迪克”·斯威夫勒最初表现为一个相当轻浮和不负责任的角色，似乎满足于与弗雷德·特兰特和丹尼尔·奎尔普等不太体面的人物为伍。他负债累累，言行 flamboyant，经常引用诗歌，摆出戏剧化的姿态。然而，正如他的姓氏“斯威夫勒”（Swiveller，意为转动者）恰当地暗示的那样，这种外在形象暗示了他潜在的可塑性和改变能力。\n随着叙事的推进，特别是当奎尔普的注意力转移到别处后，迪克开始“转向”一条更正直的道路。他与女侯爵——布拉斯家受虐待的女仆——的互动成为这一转变的重要催化剂。他最初夸张的行为让她感到不适，而他随后决定改变自己的举止以缓解她的不安，这揭示了他初生的同情心，并表明他那 flamboyant 的形象可能一直是一种掩护。当他允许自己与女侯爵建立联系时，他的“真实本性”开始浮现。\n这种不断发展的善良并非仅仅是被动的；迪克积极致力于纠正不公，最显著的是他努力为基特·纳布尔斯洗清罪名并使其重获自由。他对女侯爵的善意得到了回报，她的证词对他取得成功至关重要。最终，迪克的转变在他用遗产为女侯爵提供安全舒适的未来，使她摆脱贫困时达到顶峰。这种无私慷慨的行为是“耐儿外祖父希望为她实现的目标的完全实现版本”，但关键的区别在于，迪克拥有一种内在的韧性和足智多谋，使他即使在获得意外之财之前也能摆脱债务和不负责任的生活，这与永远挣扎的特兰特一家不同。\n第三部分\n结局与命运（第54-73章）\n作者想通过这本书传达什么？\n对城市化和工业资本主义有害影响的尖锐批判，将肮脏、贪婪和污染的城市与理想化、更简单、更纯朴的乡村生活进行对比。\n赌博的极度破坏性，阐明这种恶习如何腐蚀即使是善意的人，导致毁灭和对亲人的背叛。\n出生在严酷、冷漠的世界或功能失调的家庭环境中的无辜儿童的极度脆弱性，突出了他们的苦难以及使这种苦难永久化的社会条件。\n作者是如何传达这些信息的？（最少200字）\n狄更斯通过生动的对比、令人心酸的人物弧光和象征性的场景巧妙地传达了这些信息。\n为了阐释对城市化的批判与乡村理想的对比，他将“肮脏贪婪的伦敦市中心”和制造业城镇“烟雾弥漫的天空”与耐儿和她外祖父在乡村找到的“和平与自由”进行了鲜明对比。在城市里，历史和情感被贬低，就像奎尔普为了利润“清算了古玩店的全部存货”一样。相反，乡村社区珍视他们的过去，小心翼翼地保护着“废弃的教堂和古老的牧师住宅”。耐儿身体的衰弱显著地始于工业城镇，直接将城市凋敝与苦难联系起来，并预示了她的死亡。\n赌博的破坏性通过耐儿的外祖父得到了有力的描绘。他最初“对耐儿的爱以及为她提供更好生活的愿望”因其赌瘾而扭曲。这种源于被误导的溺爱的“贪婪”，使他变成了一个“扭曲、偏执和虚伪的自己”，最终在他试图从自己孙女那里偷窃的可怕时刻达到顶峰。这种瘾是他们逃亡和持续不幸的主要催化剂，表明了赌博如何侵蚀道德品质并摧毁家庭纽带。\n最后，狄更斯主要通过耐儿突出了无辜儿童的脆弱性。她固有的善良和纯洁使她在奎尔普之流主导的世界以及她外祖父过失的后果中航行时，其苦难显得更加悲惨。她对墓地的迷恋以及与悲伤的遭遇，例如与寡妇以及在制造业城镇因饥饿失去孩子的父亲的相遇，都强调了过早的、往往是可以避免的死亡这一主题。这些事例，特别是那些因“工业资本主义的条件”而死于“饥饿、暴露或疾病”的儿童，强调了无辜者往往是社会贪婪和恶劣环境的主要受害者。\n结合书中的例子，说明你喜欢/不喜欢这本书（300字）\n喜欢：\n1. 连载出版与片段式结构\n\n《老古玩店》是连载出版的。这种形式鼓励设置悬念、塑造令人难忘的角色，并融合幽默与悲情——所有这些特点都体现在《老古玩店》中。\n\n2. 感伤主义与社会批判\n\n《老古玩店》具有强烈的感伤主义色彩，尤其体现在小耐儿这个角色身上，她的纯真和苦难是小说情感冲击力的核心。\n\n3. 戏剧化角色与情节剧\n\n《老古玩店》包含了像丹尼尔·奎尔普（怪诞的反派）和布拉斯兄妹这样的戏剧化角色，以及耐儿旅途中的情节剧式片段。\n\n4. 多情节线的使用\n\n《老古玩店》运用了多条情节线，同时讲述了耐儿和她外祖父的旅程以及发生在伦敦的涉及基特、奎尔普等人的事件。\n\n不喜欢：\n结局，情节略显过于伤感，有时情节线不太清晰，篇幅过长。\n\npart 1\nNell and Her Grandfather’s Flight (Chapters 1–23)\nPlot Focus:\n\nIntroduction of Nell, her grandfather, and the Old Curiosity Shop.\nThe grandfather’s gambling addiction and mounting debts.\nIntroduction of key characters: Quilp, Kit, and the Brasses.\nNell and her grandfather are forced to flee London to escape Quilp and the creditors.\n\nKey Turning Point:\n\nNell and her grandfather leave the shop and begin their journey as wanderers.\n\nThe narrative perspective changes at the start of Chapter 4.\n\nChapters 1–3: Told in the first person by the unnamed narrator.\nFrom Chapter 4 onward: The narrative shifts to a third-person omniscient perspective, which continues for the rest of the novel.\n\n\nwhich scene/event left most impression (200 words minimum)\nAs Dick leaves, Kit arrives and fights Tom Scott to rescue Nell’s linnet bird, which Quilp and Tom intended to kill. Kit takes the bird home.\nChapter 14 sees Kit searching for work to buy birdseed and necessities. He encounters the Garlands, an elderly couple whose horse is obstinate. Kit offers to watch the horse while they visit Mr. Witherden, a notary. The Garlands and Mr. Witherden discuss their son, Abel, and sign legal documents witnessed by Mr. Chuckster, the notary’s clerk. The Garlands overpay Kit for his help with the horse, and he agrees to work off the difference later. Kit can now afford more for his family and the bird, and he optimistically hopes Nell and her grandfather might be at his home.\ndid you like it or not (200 words minimum)\nYes, I liked it. The analysis of Chapters 13-14 highlights how Kit stumbles into good fortune, which provides a welcome contrast to the hardships faced by other characters. The generosity of the Garlands is a “stunning change of pace,” and Kit’s determination to save Nell’s linnet bird, despite Quilp’s cruelty, is admirable. This act directly leads to his positive encounter with the Garlands because he needs birdseed. The symbolism of the linnet bird is also effective; its caging and subsequent care by Kit can be seen as him taking on Nell’s suffering, but also as a symbol of future unification, as the bird is known to fly in mixed flocks. This suggests Kit will be pivotal in bringing characters together.\nFurthermore, the shift in narrative perspective from the first-person narrator in Chapters 1-3 to a third-person omniscient view from Chapter 4 onwards greatly enhances the storytelling. This broader perspective is characteristic of many Victorian novels, allowing the author to explore multiple plotlines simultaneously, delve into the minds and motivations of various characters (like Quilp’s malice or the Garlands’ benevolence), and offer social commentary by presenting a wider slice of society. It allows the reader to follow Nell and her grandfather’s flight, Quilp’s machinations, and Kit’s developing fortunes concurrently, creating a richer and more complex narrative tapestry than a single viewpoint could achieve. Written in installments and dickens wanted it to change.\nwhat do you think will happen next (200 words minimum)\nGiven the trajectory established, I anticipate several developments. Nell and her grandfather will continue their arduous journey as fugitives. Their path will likely be fraught with hardship, and they will encounter a variety of people – some who might offer fleeting kindness, and others who might seek to exploit their vulnerability. The grandfather’s gambling addiction remains a significant weakness; despite his love for Nell, there’s a strong possibility he might succumb to temptation again if an opportunity arises, further endangering them.\nMeanwhile, Quilp will undoubtedly be furious at their escape and will likely use all his resources, including the subservient Mr. Brass, to track them down. He is not a character to let go of a perceived debt or an opportunity for torment. His pursuit will form a constant, menacing shadow over Nell and her grandfather’s attempts to find safety.\nKit’s story is poised for a more positive turn. His employment with the Garlands seems set to become more permanent. His inherent goodness and diligence will likely endear him further to the kind couple. I predict Kit will not forget Nell and will actively try to find news of her, perhaps even using his newfound stability to aid in a search. The linnet bird, now in his care, will serve as a constant reminder of his friend. Mr. Chuckster’s jealousy might create minor workplace conflicts for Kit, but it’s unlikely to derail the Garlands’ appreciation for him.\npart 2\nPursuit and Hardship (Chapters 24–53)\nPlot Focus:\n\nNell and her grandfather’s journey through the English countryside, facing poverty and hardship.\nThe parallel pursuit: Quilp’s machinations, the Brasses’ schemes, and the search for Nell by Kit and others.\nKit’s wrongful arrest and imprisonment, orchestrated by Quilp.\nNell and her grandfather find temporary refuge in various places, including the waxwork show and the church.\n\nKey Turning Point:\n\nKit is released from prison, and the search for Nell intensifies.\n\n\nWhat characters have appeared now?\nmain ones are\n\n• Nell Trent: The kind, gentle 13-year-old protagonist.\nNell’s Grandfather: Owner of the Curiosity Shop, devoted to Nell.\nChristopher (Kit) Nubbles: Loyal, good-hearted boy who works for Nell’s grandfather.\nDaniel Quilp: The cruel, manipulative dwarf and main antagonist.\nRichard (Dick) Swiveller: A whimsical, good-natured young man, friend of Fred Trent.\nSampson Brass: Unscrupulous lawyer, associate of Quilp.\nSarah (Sally) Brass: Sampson’s shrewd sister and law partner.\nBetsy Quilp: Quilp’s timid wife.\nMrs. Jiniwin: Betsy Quilp’s domineering mother.\nTom Scott: The “tumbling boy,” Quilp’s servant.\nMrs. Nubbles: Kit’s hardworking, loving mother.\nJacob Nubbles &amp; Baby Nubbles: Kit’s younger brothers.\nMr. Garland: Kind, club-footed elderly gentleman.\nMrs. Garland: His cheerful wife.\nAbel Garland: Their quiet, dutiful son.\nMr. Witherden: The notary, friend to the Garlands.\nMr. Chuckster: Clerk in Witherden’s office.\nBarbara: The Garlands’ servant girl, Kit’s love interest.\nBevis Marks: The mysterious “single gentleman” (later revealed as Nell’s great-uncle).\nMarchioness (Sophronia Sphynx): The neglected servant girl at the Brasses’ (her real name is revealed later).\n\nwhich one left the best impression?\nDick Swiveller\nanalyze this character’s characteristics (200 words minimum)\nRichard “Dick” Swiveller\nAt first, Dick seems little more than a somewhat comedic tag-along to Fred Trent and Daniel Quilp’s schemes. He owes money to many different shops and eateries, and he seems to be headed down the same path as Fred and Quilp. However, his last name hints at his malleability, and once Quilp occupies himself with torturing Kit and his family, Dick does in fact “turn” towards the good. His over-the-top theatrical behavior makes the Marchioness uncomfortable, so he changes his behavior to make her feel more at ease, which suggests that his prior persona was just a front to keep a distance between himself and others. Once he starts to let the Marchioness in, the reader sees more behavioral changes indicative of his true nature.\nThese actions pay off when Swiveller begins working to restore Kit’s good name and free him from prison. The Marchioness repays his kindness to her with her testimony, helping him accomplish his goals and rewarding him for his virtue. He also uses his inheritance to secure the Marchioness’s future, lifting her out of poverty and giving her a truly comfortable life. His actions are a fully realized version of what Nell’s grandfather hoped to accomplish for her. The main difference is that Dick had the means to live out of poverty before he received his inheritance, whereas the Trents never seemed able to escape their debts.\nRichard “Dick” Swiveller initially presents as a rather frivolous and irresponsible character, seemingly content to drift along with less reputable figures like Fred Trent and Daniel Quilp. He is characterized by his debts and a flamboyant, theatrical demeanor, often quoting poetry and adopting dramatic airs. This outward persona, however, as his surname “Swiveller” aptly suggests, hints at an underlying malleability and capacity for change.\nAs the narrative progresses, particularly once Quilp’s attention shifts elsewhere, Dick begins to “turn” towards a more virtuous path. His interactions with the Marchioness, the Brasses’ ill-treated servant girl, become a significant catalyst for this transformation. His initial over-the-top behavior makes her uncomfortable, and his subsequent decision to modify his conduct to ease her distress reveals a nascent empathy and suggests his flamboyant persona might have been a shield. As he allows himself to connect with the Marchioness, his “true nature” begins to surface.\nThis evolving goodness is not merely passive; Dick actively works to rectify injustices, most notably in his efforts to clear Kit Nubbles’s name and secure his freedom from prison. His kindness towards the Marchioness is reciprocated when her testimony proves crucial to his success. Ultimately, Dick’s transformation culminates in him using his inheritance not for selfish pursuits, but to provide a secure and comfortable future for the Marchioness, lifting her from poverty. This act of selfless generosity stands as a “fully realized version of what Nell’s grandfather hoped to accomplish for her,” but with the crucial difference that Dick possessed an inherent resilience and resourcefulness that allowed him to navigate away from a life of debt and irresponsibility even before his financial windfall, unlike the perpetually struggling Trents.\n\npart 3\nResolution and Fate (Chapters 54–73)\nPlot Focus:\n\nThe final stages of Nell and her grandfather’s journey; Nell’s declining health.\nKit and his friends’ successful efforts to track down Nell.\nThe fates of the main characters: Nell’s tragic death, the grandfather’s madness, and Quilp’s downfall.\nThe resolution of the supporting characters’ stories.\n\n\nWhat does the author want to convey through this book?\nA sharp critique of the detrimental effects of urbanization and industrial capitalism, contrasting the grimy, greedy, and polluted city with an idealized, simpler, and more virtuous rural existence.\nThe profoundly destructive nature of gambling, illustrating how this specific vice can corrupt even well-intentioned individuals, leading to ruin and the betrayal of loved ones.\nThe acute vulnerability of innocent children born into harsh, uncaring worlds or dysfunctional familial situations, highlighting their suffering and the societal conditions that perpetuate it.\nHow does the writer convey that? (200 words minimum)\nDickens masterfully conveys these messages through vivid contrasts, poignant character arcs, and symbolic settings.\nTo illustrate the urbanization critique versus rural ideal, he starkly contrasts the “grimy and greedy center of London” and the “smoke-filled sky” of the manufacturing town with the “peace and freedom” Nell and her grandfather find in the countryside. In the city, history and sentiment are devalued, as when Quilp “liquidates the entire inventory” of the Curiosity Shop for profit. Conversely, rural communities cherish their past, carefully preserving “the ruined church and old parsonage houses.” Nell’s physical decline notably begins in the industrial town, directly linking urban blight to suffering and foreshadowing her demise.\nThe destructive nature of gambling is powerfully depicted through Nell’s grandfather. His initial “love for Nell and his desire to provide her with a better life” becomes twisted by his gambling addiction. This “greed,” born of misguided affection, transforms him into a “twisted, paranoid, and deceitful version of himself,” culminating in the horrifying moment he attempts to steal from his own granddaughter. This addiction is the primary catalyst for their flight and continued misfortunes, demonstrating how gambling erodes moral character and destroys familial bonds.\nFinally, Dickens highlights the vulnerability of innocent children primarily through Nell. Her inherent goodness and purity make her suffering all the more tragic as she navigates a world dominated by figures like Quilp and the consequences of her grandfather’s failings. Her attraction to churchyards and encounters with grief, such as with the widow and the father who lost his children to starvation in the manufacturing town, underscore the theme of early, often preventable, death. These instances, particularly the children dying from “starvation, exposure, or disease” due to “the conditions of industrial capitalism,” emphasize how the innocent are often the primary victims of societal greed and harsh environments.\n\nEND\nUsing examples from the book, state whether you like/dislike this book (300 words)\nLike:\n1. Serial Publication and Episodic Structure\n\nAll of Dickens’s early novels, including The Old Curiosity Shop, were published serially (in monthly or weekly installments).\nThe success of The Pickwick Papers established Dickens’s reputation and the serial format, which he continued to use. This format encouraged cliffhangers, memorable characters, and a blend of humor and pathos—all features present in The Old Curiosity Shop.\n\n2. Sentimentality and Social Critique\n\nOliver Twist introduced a blend of social criticism (of workhouses, poverty, and crime) and sentimentality (the suffering of the innocent, like Oliver).\nThe Old Curiosity Shop amplifies this sentimentality, especially in the character of Little Nell, whose innocence and suffering are central to the novel’s emotional impact.\n\n3. Theatrical Characters and Melodrama\n\nNicholas Nickleby features exaggerated villains (like Squeers) and comic side characters, as well as melodramatic plotlines.\nThe Old Curiosity Shop continues this tradition with characters like Daniel Quilp (the grotesque villain) and the Brasses, and with melodramatic episodes in Nell’s journey.\n\n4. The Use of Multiple Plotlines\n\nIn Nicholas Nickleby, Dickens began to experiment with parallel plotlines and a large cast of characters.\nThe Old Curiosity Shop further develops this, with the story following both Nell and her grandfather’s journey and the events back in London involving Kit, Quilp, and others.\n\n\nSummary

very interesting book that was a sensation at its time of release, but is not currently regarded as one of Dickens’ best works, with some even citing it as an example of his worst writing 00:21.\n\n\nThe novel contains several interweaving stories, with the primary story focusing on Nell Trent and her grandfather, who owns the Old Curiosity Shop, an old antique shop, at the beginning of the novel 00:46.\n\n\nThe grandfather’s ownership of the shop is short-lived, as he quickly loses it due to his gambling debts, forcing him and Nell to leave the shop and live a life of poverty, with the novel following their travels as they struggle to survive 00:54.\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop is part of a series of Dickens’ novels, and it is worth analyzing to understand its significance and flaws, with some considering it one of Dickens’ better early novels, despite having some flaws 00:10.\n\n\nThe novel’s story is complex, with the primary plot following Nell and her grandfather as they go through the highs and lows of struggling to survive, making it a compelling story to explore and discuss 01:06.\n\n\nA Rocky Start 01:13\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop begins with a narrative in the first person, told from the perspective of a character who encounters Little Nell one night and visits the old curiosity shop with her, but this framing device disappears after about three chapters and switches to a third-person narrator, which can be jarring for readers 01:13.\n\n\nThe reason for this narrative switch is that Charles Dickens initially intended The Old Curiosity Shop to be part of another series called Master Humphrey’s Clock, but he decided to abandon this format and focus on The Old Curiosity Shop as a standalone story 01:56.\n\n\nDespite the rocky start, the early part of the book creates good tension as the reader tries to understand what is happening with Nell and her grandfather, and their family drama, including a scene where Nell is left alone by her grandfather in the creepy old antique shop 02:37.\n\n\nThe novel explores the theme of the powerlessness of children, but unlike Oliver Twist, where the damage is caused by society, The Old Curiosity Shop focuses on the destructive force of family, particularly the grandfather’s gambling debts and obsession, which ultimately lead to Nell’s downfall 03:39.\n\n\nDickens’s portrayal of the grandfather is complex, showing him as a soft-spoken, gentle old man who loves his granddaughter, but also as a cruel and monstrous figure due to his gambling obsession, which is evident in a scene where he treats Nell coldly and says hurtful things to her 04:27.\n\n\nThe novel also features a mirroring effect, where Nell is surrounded by ancient objects at the beginning and end of the novel, first in the old curiosity shop and later in an ancient church, which adds depth to the story 03:02.\n\n\nThe character of the old man in the story has a dark and evil side that emerges due to his obsession, which is a well-developed aspect of his personality, and this contrast between his gentle and evil sides is particularly notable 04:54.\n\n\nNell’s death in the story is a significant difference from Oliver Twist, as it does not have a happy ending, and this was actually an idea suggested by John Foster, a friend of Charles Dickens, rather than Dickens himself 05:01.\n\n\nThe decision to kill off Nell was likely a good idea, as it adds variety to the typical Dickens narrative of happy endings for orphans, and allows for a more nuanced exploration of the characters and their experiences 05:07.\n\n\nDespite her reputation for being insipid and weak, Nell is actually a more active and engaging character than she is often given credit for, as she is the instigator of much of the action in the story and makes key decisions, such as deciding to leave when her grandfather’s gambling becomes a problem 05:35.\n\n\nIn comparison to Oliver, Nell is a more interesting and dynamic character, as she drives the plot forward and takes initiative, whereas Oliver is often passive and reliant on others, except for a few notable moments, such as when he stands up for his mother 06:06.\n\n\nNell’s character can be seen as a more engaging archetype for Dickens, as she embodies the virtuous and innocent type, but also has a more nuanced and active personality that adds depth to the story 06:17.\n\n\nThree Storylines 06:33\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop has three main protagonists, each with their own intersecting storyline, including Little Nell and her grandfather, who become beggars and must find their way in the world, Kit, a young boy who worked for Nell and her grandfather and gets sacked at the beginning of the novel, and Richard Swiveler, a friend of Nell’s brother Frederick, who is initially portrayed as a comic secondary villain but eventually becomes a good-hearted hero 06:33.\n\n\nKit’s storyline involves trying to make his own way in the world, but he is framed for a crime he didn’t commit by the evil villain Daniel Quilp, leading to a dramatic court case, which is one of the best parts of the book 06:50.\n\n\nRichard Swiveler’s storyline involves being persuaded by Frederick to marry Nell in order to get hold of the grandfather’s secret money, but he eventually becomes a good-hearted character and his storyline is entertaining due to his character’s twist and unexpected development 07:21.\n\n\nDaniel Quilp is a hunchbacked, crooked dwarf who is an apologetically evil villain, constantly causing mischief and terror, and is the instigator of much of the suffering in the story, including the grandfather’s loss of money and Kit’s framing for a crime 08:11.\n\n\nThe three storylines blend well together, with each having their own moments, and Little Nell and her grandfather’s journey is reminiscent of The Pickwick Papers, but much darker, with many of their meetings with people being threatening or harmful 09:08.\n\n\nOne of the notable characters that Little Nell and her grandfather meet during their journey is Mrs. Jarley, who runs a traveling waxworks museum and is a fantastic, gregarious character who helps them and provides a sense of hope that things might work out 09:42.\n\n\nThe character of Nell is well-liked, and her episode in the novel is particularly enjoyable, although some parts of her story are uneven, such as when she and her grandfather arrive at The Village, where the narrative spends too long in a holding pattern, setting the stage for her eventual death 10:02.\n\n\nThe story of Dick Swiveler is a favorite, as he initially appears to be a lackey but eventually becomes a significant character who resolves major plot points, with his story taking a turn when he gets a job with the lawyer Mr. Brass and his sister Sally Brass 10:43.\n\n\nThe characters of Mr. Brass, Sally Brass, and their servant girl, who Swiveler calls the Marchioness, are well-developed and interesting, with the Marchioness being a shrewd character who forms a good relationship with Swiveler 11:14.\n\n\nKit is a character who is not disliked, but his storyline is somewhat mundane until he gets framed for a crime, at which point his storyline becomes more engaging, particularly when compared to the more dynamic storylines of Nell and Swiveler 11:39.\n\n\nThe three storylines of Nell, Swiveler, and Kit work well together and integrate effectively, demonstrating Dickens’ improvement in his writing, as he successfully combines pastoral elements, comedy, and darker moments with well-developed characters 12:17.\n\n\nDickens’ development as a writer is evident in The Old Curiosity Shop, as he ties together various elements from his previous novels to create a cohesive and engaging narrative, with a clear through line underlying the episodic structure of the story 12:41.\n\n\nNells Death 12:58\n\n\nThe decision to kill Nell in Charles Dickens’ novel was not Dickens’ own idea, but rather his friend John Foster’s, which has changed the view on Nell’s death and given a new appreciation for it 12:58.\n\n\nNell’s death scene is often criticized for being overly sentimental and saccharine, with Oscar Wilde’s quote being a famous example of this criticism, but it is possible that this criticism has become a cliche and may not entirely be true 13:24.\n\n\nCharles Dickens was very attached to his characters, including Nell, and his biography reveals that he was obsessed with them, which may have contributed to the overly sentimental death scene as he felt guilty about killing her off 14:22.\n\n\nThe death scene can be seen as a reflection of Dickens’ creative process and his relationship with his characters, making it an interesting aspect of the story, but it is still considered a flaw in the writing as it is an example of the novelist intruding into the story 15:11.\n\n\nDespite the flaws, the buildup to Nell’s death is well done and Dickens effectively plays with the audience’s emotions, making the scene a sensation at the time, and some parts of the death scene can be seen as beautifully poetic 16:36.\n\n\nMissed Opportunities and Loose Ends 16:51\n\n\nThe character of Frederick, Nell’s brother, is introduced at the beginning of the novel, setting up an antagonism between him and the grandfather, but he is largely absent from the rest of the story, only receiving a passing mention at the end, which seems bizarre and jars with the narrative 17:16.\n\n\nThe character of The Marchioness is entertaining, but her presence in the story feels like a missed opportunity, as she is not given enough time to develop, and her interesting personality traits, such as her willingness to listen in on conversations and steal, are not fully explored 18:28.\n\n\nThe Marchioness’s character may have been downplayed to avoid competition with Nell, as both are young women who suffer, but this decision is seen as a shame, as The Marchioness is considered a great and interesting character 19:37.\n\n\nThe death of Daniel Quilp, which occurs by accident in a dark and slippery area by the docks, has a certain poetic justice to it, but the fact that it is an accident makes it less satisfying than a more intentional death or arrest would have been 20:04.\n\n\nDespite the unsatisfying resolution of Quilp’s character, the scene of his death is well-written and gruesome, showcasing Dickens’s skill at writing scary death scenes 21:01.\n\n\nConclusion 21:14\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop is considered a fantastic book, despite having some weaknesses, and is seen as the culmination of all of Charles Dickens’s earlier novels, combining elements from works like The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist, with an overarching narrative and character storylines, such as Kit’s, that work well together 21:14.\n\n\nThe book brings together various themes and elements from Dickens’s previous works, including pastoral and child-focused storylines, and features characters trying to make their way in the world, similar to Nicholas Nickleby, with some loose ends and inconsistencies in the framing narrative, particularly with regards to Frederick and the Marchioness 21:26.\n\n\nThe ending of the book is somewhat sentimental and overdone, but provides insight into Dickens’s relationship with his characters, and overall, the book is enjoyable, with a more positive assessment on a second reading compared to the initial one 21:50.\n\n\nReaders are invited to share their thoughts on The Old Curiosity Shop, including how it compares to Dickens’s other earlier novels, and whether they consider it the best among his works, in order to discuss and share opinions

It was so popular that New York readers reputedly stormed the wharf when the ship bearing the final instalment arrived in 1841.[2]\nThe Old Curiosity Shop was printed in book form in 1841. Queen Victoria read the novel that year and found it “very interesting and cleverly written”.[3]\nThe plot follows the journey of Nell Trent and her grandfather, both residents of The Old Curiosity Shop in London, whose lives are thrown into disarray and destitution due to the machinations of an evil moneylender and the grandfather’s addiction to gambling.\nPlot\n\nOld Curiosity Shop, Portsmouth Street, 1884 by Philip Norman\nThe Old Curiosity Shop tells the story of Nell Trent, a beautiful and virtuous young girl of “not quite fourteen”. An orphan, she lives with her maternal grandfather (whose name is never revealed) in his shop of odds and ends. Her grandfather loves her dearly, and Nell does not complain, but she lives a lonely existence with almost no friends her own age. Her only friend is Kit, an honest boy employed at the shop, whom she is teaching to write.\nSecretly obsessed with ensuring that Nell does not die in poverty as her parents did, her grandfather attempts to provide Nell with a good inheritance through gambling at cards. He keeps his nocturnal games a secret, but borrows heavily from the evil Daniel Quilp, a malicious, grotesquely deformed, hunchbacked dwarf moneylender. In the end, he gambles away what little money they have, and Quilp seizes the opportunity to take possession of the shop and evict Nell and her grandfather. Her grandfather suffers a breakdown that leaves him bereft of his wits, and Nell takes him away to the Midlands of England, to live as beggars.\nConvinced that the old man has stored up a large fortune for Nell, her wastrel older brother, Frederick, convinces the good-natured but easily led Dick Swiveller to help him track Nell down, so that Swiveller can marry Nell and share her supposed inheritance with Frederick. To this end, they join forces with Quilp, who knows full well that there is no fortune, but sadistically chooses to ‘help’ them in order to enjoy the misery it will inflict on all concerned.\nQuilp begins to try to track Nell down, but the fugitives are not easily discovered. To keep Dick Swiveller under his eye, Quilp arranges for him to be taken as a clerk by Quilp’s lawyer, Mr. Brass. At the Brass firm, Dick befriends the mistreated maidservant and nicknames her ‘the Marchioness’.\nNell, having fallen in with a succession of characters, some villainous and some kind, finally succeeds in leading her grandfather to safety in a far-off village (identified by Dickens as Tong, Shropshire), but this comes at a considerable cost to Nell’s health.\nMeanwhile, Kit has found new employment with the kind Mr and Mrs Garland. Here he is contacted by a mysterious ‘single gentleman’ who is looking for news of Nell and her grandfather. The ‘single gentleman’ and Kit’s mother go after them unsuccessfully, and encounter Quilp, who is also hunting for the runaways. Quilp forms a grudge against Kit and has him framed as a thief. Kit is sentenced to transportation. However, Dick Swiveller proves Kit’s innocence with the help of his friend the Marchioness. Quilp is hunted down and dies trying to escape his pursuers.\nAt the same time, a coincidence leads Mr Garland to knowledge of Nell’s whereabouts, and he, Kit, and the single gentleman (who turns out to be the younger brother of Nell’s grandfather) go to find her. Sadly, by the time they arrive, Nell has died as a result of her arduous journey. Her grandfather, already mentally infirm, refuses to admit she is dead and sits every day by her grave waiting for her to come back until, a few months later, he dies himself.\nFraming device\nMaster Humphrey’s Clock was a weekly serial that contained both short stories and two novels (The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge). Some of the short stories act as frame stories to the novels.\nOriginally the conceit of the story was that Master Humphrey was reading it aloud to a group of his friends, gathered at his house around the grandfather clock in which he eccentrically kept his manuscripts. Consequently, when the novel begins, it is told in the first person, with Master Humphrey as the narrator. However, Dickens soon changed his mind about how best to tell the story, and abandoned the first-person narrator after chapter three. Once the novel was ended, Master Humphrey’s Clock added a concluding scene, where Master Humphrey’s friends (after he has finished reading the novel to them) complain that the ‘single gentleman’ is never given a name; Master Humphrey tells them that the novel was a true story, that the ‘single gentleman’ was in fact himself, and that the events of the first three chapters were fictitious, intended only to introduce the characters. This was Dickens’s after-the-fact explanation of why the narrator disappeared and why (if he was their near relation) he gave no sign in the first three chapters of knowing who they were. At least one editor thinks this device “need not be taken seriously.”[4][full citation needed]\nDickens’s original artistic intent was to keep the short stories and the novels together, and the short stories and the novels were published in 1840 in three bound volumes under the title Master Humphrey’s Clock, which retains the original full and correct ordering of texts. However, Dickens himself cancelled Master Humphrey’s Clock before 1848, and describes in a preface to The Old Curiosity Shop that he wishes the story to not be tied down to the miscellany within which it began.[5][full citation needed] Most later anthologies published the short stories and the novels separately.\nCharacters\nMajor\n\n“At Rest” Illustration by George Cattermole\n\nNell Trent, the novel’s main character. Portrayed as infallibly good and angelic, she leads her grandfather on their journey to save them from misery. Her health gradually becomes weaker throughout the journey.\nNell’s Grandfather, Nell’s guardian. After losing both his wife and daughter, he sees Nell as the embodiment of their good spirits. His grandson Fred is seen as the successor to his son-in-law, who he felt unworthy of his daughter. As such, he shows him no affection. He is paranoid about falling into poverty and gambles to try to stave that off; as his money runs out, he turns to Quilp for loans to continue to furnish for Nell the life he feels she deserves. After believing Kit has revealed his secret addiction, he falls ill and is mentally unstable afterwards. Nell then protects him as he had done for her.\nChristopher “Kit” Nubbles, Nell’s friend and servant. He watches out for Nell when she is left in the shop alone at night (although she doesn’t know he’s there) and will ‘never come home to his bed until he thinks she safe in hers’. After Quilp takes over the shop, Kit offers Nell a place in his house. His mother is concerned about his attachment to Nell, and at one point jokes, ‘some people would say that you’d fallen in love with her’, at which Kit becomes very bashful and tries to change the subject. He is later given a position at the Garlands’ house, and becomes an important member of their household. His dedication to his family earns him the respect of many characters and the resentment of Quilp. He is framed for robbery, but is later released and joins the party traveling to recover Nell.\n\n\nQuilp by ‘Kyd’ (1889)\n\nDaniel Quilp, the novel’s primary villain. He mistreats his wife, Betsy, and manipulates others to his own ends through a false charm he has developed over the years. He lends money to Nell’s grandfather and takes possession of the curiosity shop during the old man’s illness (which he had caused by revealing his knowledge of the old man’s bad gambling habit). He uses sarcasm to belittle those he wishes to control, most notably his wife, and takes a sadistic delight in the suffering of others. He eavesdrops so as to know all of ‘the old man’s’ most private thoughts, and teases him, saying ‘you have no secrets from me now’. He also drives a wedge between Kit and the old man (and as a result between Kit and Nell) by pretending it was Kit who told him about the gambling.\nRichard “Dick” Swiveller, in turn, Frederick Trent’s manipulated friend, Sampson Brass’s clerk, and the Marchioness’ guardian and eventual husband. He delights in quoting and adapting literature to describe his experiences. He is very laid-back and doesn’t seem to worry about anything, despite the fact that he owes money to just about everybody. Following Fred’s departure from the story, he becomes more independent and eventually is seen as a strong force for good, securing Kit’s release from prison and the Marchioness’s future. His transformation from an idle and vacant youth to a key helpmate bridges the depiction of the main characters that are either mostly villainous or goodly in nature.\nThe Single Gentleman, who is never named, is the estranged younger brother of Nell’s grandfather. He leads the search for the travelers after taking lodging in Sampson Brass’ rooms and befriending Dick, Kit, and the Garlands.\n\nMinor\n\nMrs. Betsy Quilp, Quilp’s mistreated wife. She is mortally afraid of her husband but appears to love him in spite of everything, as she was genuinely worried when he disappeared for a long period.\nMr. Sampson Brass, an attorney (what would now be called a solicitor) of the Court of the King’s Bench. A grovelling, obsequious man, he is an employee of Mr. Quilp, at whose urging he frames Kit for robbery.\nMiss Sarah “Sally” Brass, Mr. Brass’ obnoxious sister and clerk. She is the real authority in the Brass firm. She is occasionally referred to as a “dragon”, and she mistreats the Marchioness. Quilp makes amorous advances towards her, but is rebuffed.\nMrs. Jarley, proprietor of a travelling waxworks show, who takes in Nell and her grandfather out of kindness. However, she only appears briefly.\nFrederick Trent, Nell’s worthless older brother, who is convinced that his grandfather is secretly wealthy (when in actuality he was the primary cause of the old man’s poverty, according to the single gentleman). Initially a major character in the novel and highly influential over Richard Swiveller, he is dropped from the narrative after chapter 23. Briefly mentioned as travelling to Great Britain and the wider world following his disappearance from the story, before being found injured and drowned in the River Seine after the story’s conclusion. The character was named after the novelist’s younger brother, Frederick Dickens.[6]\nMr. Garland, a kind-hearted man, father of Abel Garland and employer of Kit.\nThe Small Servant, Miss Brass’ maidservant. Dick Swiveller befriends her and, finding that she does not know her age or name (Sally Brass simply refers to her as “Little Devil”) or parents, nicknames her “The Marchioness” and later gives her the name Sophronia Sphynx. In the original manuscript, it is made explicit that the Marchioness is in fact the illegitimate daughter of Miss Brass, possibly by Quilp, but only a suggestion of this survived in the published edition.\nIsaac List and Joe Jowl, professional gamblers. They are fellow guests at the public house where Nell and her grandfather, unable to get home, pass a stormy night. Nell’s grandfather is unable to resist gambling with them and fleeces Nell of what little money she has to this end. That same night, he also robs her of even more money.\nMr. Chuckster, the dogsbody of the notary Mr. Witherden, who employs Mr. Abel Garland. He takes a strong dislike to Kit after Mr. Garland overpays Kit for a job and Kit returns to work off the difference; he shows his dislike at every opportunity, calling Kit ‘Snobby’.\nMr. Marton, a poor schoolmaster. He befriends Nell and later inadvertently meets her and her grandfather on the roads. Nell approaches him to beg for alms, not realising who he is. She faints from a combination of shock and exhaustion, and, realising she is ill, he takes her to an inn and pays for the doctor, and then takes her and her grandfather to live with him in the distant village where he has been appointed parish clerk.\nThomas Codlin, proprietor of a travelling Punch and Judy show.\nMr. Harris, called ‘Short Trotters’, the puppeteer of the Punch and Judy show.\nBarbara, the maidservant of Mr. and Mrs. Garland and future wife of Kit.\nThe Bachelor, brother of Mr. Garland. Lives in the village where Nell and her grandfather end their journey, and unknowingly alerts his brother to their presence through a letter.\nMrs. Jiniwin, Mrs. Quilp’s mother and Quilp’s mother-in-law. She resents Quilp for the way he treats her daughter, but is too afraid to stand up to him.\n\nLiterary significance and criticism\nProbably the most widely repeated criticism of Dickens is the remark reputedly made by Oscar Wilde that “one must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing.”[7] The scene of Nell’s death is not actually part of the text, however. Of a similar opinion was the poet Algernon Swinburne, who commented that “a child whom nothing can ever irritate, whom nothing can even baffle, whom nothing can ever misguide, whom nothing can ever delude, and whom nothing can ever dismay, is a monster as inhuman as a baby with two heads”.[8]\nThe Irish leader Daniel O’Connell famously burst into tears at the finale, and threw the book out of the window of the train in which he was travelling.[9]\nThe excitement surrounding the conclusion of the series was unprecedented. (However, stories that Dickens fans stormed the docks in New York City, eager for the latest installment of the novel, or news of it, are apocryphal.)[10] In 2007, many newspapers claimed that the excitement at the release of the last instalment of The Old Curiosity Shop was the only historical comparison that could be made to the excitement at the release of the last Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[11]\nThe Norwegian author Ingeborg Refling Hagen is said to have buried a copy of the book in her youth, stating that nobody deserved to read about Nell, because nobody would ever understand her pain. She compared herself to Nell, because of her own miserable situation at the time.[citation needed]\nAllusions to actual history and geography\nThe Old Curiosity Shop\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop, London\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to The Old Curiosity Shop, 13–14 Portsmouth Street.\nA shop named “The Old Curiosity Shop” can be found at 13–14 Portsmouth Street, Holborn, London, WC2A 2ES, and is now owned by the London School of Economics.[12] The building dates back to the sixteenth century (1567)[13] in an area known as Clare Market, but the shop name was added after the novel was released, as it was thought to be the inspiration for Dickens’s description of the antique shop.[14] At one time it functioned as a dairy on an estate given by King Charles II to one of his many mistresses. It was built using timber from old ships, and survived the bombs of World War II. The shop was restored in 2023 to repair structural problems and will be rented out again as a shop.[15][16]\nThe Route They Took[17]\n\nNell and her grandfather meet Codlin and Short in a churchyard in Aylesbury.\nThe horse races where Nell and her grandfather go with the show people are at Banbury.\nThe village where they first meet the schoolmaster is Warmington, Warwickshire.\nThey meet Mrs. Jarley near the village of Gaydon, Warwickshire.\nThe town where they work at Jarley’s Waxworks is Warwick.\nThe heavily industrialised town where Nell spends the night by the furnace is Birmingham (after they have travelled on the Warwick and Birmingham Canal).\nThe town in which Nell faints and is rescued by the school master is Wolverhampton in the Black Country.\nThe village where they finally find peace and rest and where Nell dies is Tong, Shropshire.\n\nOther real locations used in the novel include London Bridge, Bevis Marks, Finchley, and Minster-on-Sea.\nIt is reported by local Coventry historian David McGrory that Charles Dickens used Coventry’s Whitefriars gatehouse in The Old Curiosity Shop. This gatehouse building still exists in Much Park Street.[18]\nAdaptations\nLotta Crabtree performed for years as Nell in Little Nell and the Marchioness.[19]\n\nDickens and Little Nell, an 1890 statue by Francis Edwin Elwell exhibited in Philadelphia\n\nThere were several silent film adaptations of the novel including two directed by Thomas Bentley:\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (1913)\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (1921)\n\n\nNelly, an opera based on the novel, by Italian composer Lamberto Landi, was composed in 1916; it premiered in Lucca in 1947.[20]\nThe first talkie version was a 1934 British film starring Hay Petrie as Quilp.\nThe novel was serialised for television by the BBC in 1962, starring Patrick Troughton as Quilp. No recordings of this production are known to exist.[21]\nA British musical version of The Old Curiosity Shop (titled Mr. Quilp in the United States) was released in 1975. The filmmakers were hoping to cash in on the recent success of Oliver!, which was also based on a Dickens classic, but the film was notably unsuccessful.\nAn anime adaptation, Sasurai no Shoujo Nell (Wandering Girl Nell), aired in Japan from 1979 to 1980.[22]\nIn 1979, a nine-part miniseries, featuring Natalie Ogle as Nell and Trevor Peacock as Quilp, was created by the BBC and later released on DVD. There was no Frederick character and the story ends with the grandfather mourning at Nell’s grave.\nIn 1984, an animated version was produced by Burbank Films in Australia.\nIn 1995, Tom Courtenay and Peter Ustinov starred in a Disney made-for-television film[23] adaptation as Quilp and the grandfather, with Sally Walsh[24] as Nell.\nA BBC Radio 4 adaptation was broadcast in 1998. The production starred Tom Courtenay as Quilp, Denis Quilley, Michael Maloney and Teresa Gallagher.\nA second adaptation for BBC Radio 4, first broadcast in 2002-03,[25] was narrated by Alex Jennings, with Emily Chenery (Nell), Phil Daniels (Quilp), Daniel Bliss (Kit), Trevor Peacock (grandfather), Clive Swift, Anna Massey and Julia McKenzie.\nA television film adaptation was produced by ITV, broadcast in the UK on 26 December 2007, and repeated on 14 December 2008.[26]\nLittle Nell is featured in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sculptural group Dickens and Little Nell (1890).\nNell and her grandfather are featured prominently in the BBC’s 2015 Christmas drama Dickensian, which brings together many of Dickens’s iconic characters in one story.\nRussell T.

First published in serial form between 1840-1841, it tells the heart-wrenching tale of Little Nell Trent and her grandfather as they flee from the villainous dwarf Daniel Quilp. Dickens’s sentimental portrayal of Little Nell’s plight and suffering deeply moved Victorian audiences, reportedly causing grown men to weep openly. Later, critics like Oscar Wilde famously mocked the novel’s pathos. Despite such criticism, The Old Curiosity Shop remains one of Dickens’s most popular works, admired for its vivid characters and gripping narrative.\n\nPlot\nThe Old Curiosity Shop follows Nell Trent, a virtuous young girl who lives with her grandfather in his curiosity shop in London. Her grandfather, obsessed with providing Nell a good inheritance, secretly gambles away their money and borrows heavily from the evil dwarf moneylender Daniel Quilp. When Quilp seizes the shop, Nell and her grandfather flee London to live as beggars in the English Midlands.\nMeanwhile, Nell’s wastrel brother Frederick convinces his friend Dick Swiveller to help track down Nell, believing she has a fortune. They join forces with Quilp, who knows there is no fortune but sadistically wants to cause misery. As Nell and her grandfather journey through England, they encounter various characters both kind and evil. Quilp continues trying to hunt them down.\nBack in London, the kindhearted Kit, who once worked at the curiosity shop, finds new employment with the Garland family. A mysterious “single gentleman” contacts Kit looking for news of Nell. Kit is later framed for theft by Quilp but proven innocent with help from Dick Swiveller and a servant girl nicknamed “the Marchioness.” Quilp dies while trying to escape his pursuers.\nEventually, Mr. Garland learns Nell’s location and sets out with Kit and the single gentleman, who is revealed to be Nell’s great-uncle, to find her. By the time they arrive, however, Nell has died from the hardships of her journey. Her grandfather, mentally unstable, spends his days sitting by her grave until he passes away a few months later.\n\nThemes\n\n\nGood vs evil\n\n\nThe effects of gambling addiction\n\n\nThe journey as a metaphor for life\n\n\nThe power of friendship and loyalty\n\n\nSocial injustice and poverty in Victorian England\n\n\nThe idealization of childhood and death\n\n\n\nSetting\nThe Old Curiosity Shop is set in England in the 1820s, during the early Victorian era. The story primarily takes place in London and the English Midlands, reflecting the stark contrasts between urban and rural life during this period of rapid industrialization and social change.\nThe titular curiosity shop is located in London, likely inspired by a 16th-century building in Holborn that still stands. As Nell and her grandfather flee the city, the novel depicts various towns and villages across the Midlands, including Warwick, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton. Their journey provides Dickens the opportunity to paint a vivid portrait of England’s diverse landscapes and communities.\nThe final scenes unfold in the village of Tong, Shropshire, where Nell and her grandfather find refuge. This picturesque rural setting, with its ancient church and tranquil surroundings, serves as a poignant contrast to the grim urban environments encountered earlier in the novel. Through these varied locales, Dickens crafts a rich tapestry of early 19th-century English life, from bustling city streets to pastoral countryside.\n\nCharacters\n\n\nNell Trent: The protagonist, a young woman around 14 years old. Virtuous, innocent, and selfless, Nell cares for her grandfather and leads him on their journey to escape poverty. Her health gradually declines as she sacrifices herself for others. Nell embodies purity and goodness in the face of hardship.\n\n\nNell’s Grandfather: Nell’s unnamed guardian who is obsessed with providing her an inheritance. He develops a gambling addiction trying to win money for Nell, falling into debt with Quilp. After a mental breakdown, he becomes unstable, and Nell must protect him. His love for Nell is his defining characteristic, though it leads to their downfall.\n\n\nDaniel Quilp: The primary villain. A malicious, deformed dwarf moneylender who delights in others’ suffering. He takes over the curiosity shop and pursues Nell and her grandfather. Quilp is cruel, manipulative and sadistic, tormenting his wife and all those around him for his own amusement.\n\n\nChristopher “Kit” Nubbles: Nell’s loyal friend and servant. Kindhearted and honest, Kit looks out for Nell and later finds work with the Garlands. He is framed for theft by Quilp but eventually cleared. Kit represents goodness and devotion.\n\n\nRichard “Dick” Swiveller: A carefree, literature-quoting young man who undergoes a transformation. Initially Frederick’s manipulated friend, he later becomes a force for good, helping free Kit and caring for the Marchioness. Dick provides comic relief and demonstrates redemption is possible.\n\n\nThe Single Gentleman: Nell’s grandfather’s estranged younger brother, who searches for the pair. He is key to the plot and represents familial loyalty and persistence.\n\n\nMrs. Betsy Quilp: Daniel Quilp’s mistreated wife who fears but seems to love him. She worries when he disappears, showing complexity in their toxic relationship.\n\n\nSampson Brass: An unethical, groveling attorney employed by Quilp. He assists in framing Kit for robbery at Quilp’s urging.\n\n\nThe Marchioness: The abused servant girl befriended by Dick Swiveller. She helps prove Kit’s innocence and eventually marries Dick, representing hope for a better life.\n\n\n\nQuick facts\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop was originally published as a weekly serial from 1840 to 1841 in Dickens’s periodical Master Humphrey’s Clock.\n\n\nThe excitement surrounding the conclusion of the serialized story was unprecedented, with American readers reportedly storming the docks in New York awaiting the final installment.\n\n\nThe character of Little Nell was based in part on Dickens’s sister-in-law Mary Hogarth, who died at age 17.\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop was Dickens’s first novel to feature a child as the central character.\n\n\nQueen Victoria read the novel in 1841 and found it “very interesting and cleverly written.”\n\n\nOscar Wilde famously quipped that “one must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing.”\n\n\nA shop in London named “The Old Curiosity Shop” claims to be the inspiration for the book, though it was actually named after the novel’s publication.\n\n\nThe novel follows Nell and her grandfather’s journey through real locations in England, including London, Birmingham, and Shropshire.\n\n\nThe villainous character of Quilp is considered one of Dickens’s most memorable and grotesque creations.\n\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop inspired a 1975 American musical film titled Mr. Quilp, which attempted to replicate the success of Oliver! but was ultimately unsuccessful. \n\n\nAn anime adaptation called Wandering Girl Nell aired in Japan from 1979 to 1980.\n\n\nIn 2007, the BBC produced a television film version, starring Derek Jacobi and Toby Jones.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nCharles Dickens (1812-1870) was one of the most popular and influential English novelists of the Victorian era. He began his career as a journalist before achieving fame with his first novel, The Pickwick Papers, in 1837. He went on to write numerous beloved and acclaimed classics, including Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, A Christmas Carol, David Copperfield, Great Expectations, A Tale of Two  Cities, and Bleak House. Dickens’s vivid characters, intricate plots, and sharp social commentary made him immensely popular with readers across class lines during his lifetime.\nBorn in Portsmouth, Dickens endured a difficult childhood that included working in a factory at age 12 when his father was imprisoned for debt. His early experiences profoundly influenced his writing. A master of serialized fiction, Dickens would publish most of his major novels in monthly or weekly installments, building suspense with cliffhanger endings that kept Victorian readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter. His writing style was marked by a flair for caricature, flights of fancy, and sentimental scenes juxtaposed with harsh social realities. Through his fiction, Dickens powerfully depicted the ills of Victorian society and championed social reform.\nBeyond his literary output, Dickens was a tireless performer who captivated audiences with dramatic readings from his works. He undertook numerous reading tours in Britain and America that further cemented his fame. Dickens died at age 58, leaving his final novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, unfinished. \nUp Next\n[\n\nThe Naturals by Jennifer Lynn Barnes\nHidden talents and FBI cold cases collide in this thrilling young adult novel about extraordinary teens solving extraordinary crimes.\n](www.audible.com/blog/summary-the-naturals-by-jennifer-lynn-barnes)[\n\nWe Were Liars by E.

We are all going to the play, or coming home from it.”\nThe Old Curiosity Shop ~~ Charles Dickens\n\nI have a strange history with The Old Curiosity Shop. I bought it in 2009. Started reading it in 2012. Lost it in a move. Found it in 2014. Misplaced it while shelving books. Found it again in 2019. And now, I finally finished it. So my annual December Dickensthon took place this autumn. And that’s OK, ~~ honestly, this feels very much like an autumnal book.\nSome random thoughts before I review The Old Curiosity Shop*\n*This is a very difficult book to review\n*The subplots of The Old Curiosity Shop are far more interesting than the main plot\n*Dickens is far better at writing young male leads than young female leads\n*Nell’s Grandfather doesn’t love her, he uses her\n*Nell’s Grandfather is an asshole\n*Richard Swiveller shows remarkable powers of redemption ~~ I loved Dick Swiveller\n*Kit would make a wonderful lead character. I’d love to visit the world Kit inhabits fully\n\nSo my dear Dickens ~~ you threw a curve ball at me this time. The Old Curiosity Shop is perhaps too Dickensian; am I making sense?\nSweet, innocent, pure of heart, a child victimized by a cruel injustice or heart-breaking misfortune ~~ only in this case it was both ~~ and if that’s not enough, this is visited upon two different youths: one suffering injustice the other misfortune ~~ Dickens X2 ~~ but more is not always better. And yet, with all this tragedy taking place in both Nell and Kit’s world, Dickens is able to set everything right. Well, almost everything.\nIt’s a familiar world ~~ all the Dickens’ trademarks are all here ~~ the villains, the broad caricatures, the amusing names, the kindly poor, the powerful benefactors, and bits of humor scattered here or there.\nAnd yet ~~ it’s a different Dickens ~~ a young Dickens …\n\nThe old curiosity shop is the business establishment of Grandfather Trent; he lives there with his adored and angelic granddaughter Nell. For want of a better name, Trent is a real asshole. It was Old Trent’s poor judgement that allowed Quilp to enter the Trent’s world. It is his addictions that lead to his family’s misfortunes. In the employ of Mr. Trent is young Kit, the honest and dutiful son of a widowed mother. Kit is the hero of the piece, and one of most interesting characters in the whole piece.\nAnother surprise is the character of young Mr. Richard Swiveller; he was thought to be quite a good for nothing and a cad, but he turns out to be a shining knight. He is the other hero of our tale. Dickens is a master of writing tales of redemption, and Dick is one of the best examples of Dickens’ mastery in this area.\nInto this mix are thrown the evil Sally Brass, one of the best villains Dickens has ever written, Mrs. Jarley, a kindly woman who shelters Nell and her grandfather from the evils of their world, the Schoolmaster, who is kind hearted, but his arrival is a little too convenient. And let’s not forget Marchioness, Sally’s long suffering servant, who turns the tables on the Brass family.\n\nAnd there is Daniel Quilp, an evil dwarf who makes everyone’s lives miserable. And yet, as evil as Quilp is, I hold firm that the true villain of the piece is Grandfather Trent.\nAnd how is the book? Dickens is an extraordinary novelist, of that there can be no doubt. And yet, despite his unquestioned status among English writers it could be argued he still doesn’t get the credit he deserves. Many today view his write too melodramatic. I know his characters can be two dimensional ~~ but most are well rounded and complex. Yes his story lines can meander, but the way he controls his plots is amazing. His writing helped to elevate the novel to new heights. And lastly, the social reforms that benefited the working classes in Victorian England would never have happened without the voice of Charles Dickens. Dickens does all this and more within the pages of The Old Curiosity Shop.\nLastly, I have to admit I was not entirely satisfied with Dickens’ ending. Maybe it’s because I knew the ending in advance. Little Nell’s fate didn’t concern me in the end. I wanted to know what became of my friends Kit and Dick. Nell and grandfather had grown superfluous to me. But, The Old Curiosity Shop was riveting, and Dickens offered so many unpredictable surprises.\nOne more thing. I took the ending much better than Oscar Wilde did It turns out for all his criticism, Wilde never read the tale of Little Nell.\n\nreview 2\nThe Old Curiosity Shop was the most popular of Dickens’s novels during his lifetime. Yet now there is perhaps no other novel by him which splits opinion so much. How can that be?\nThe simple answer is that tastes change. Just as with modern-day fantasy stories the reader has to suspend their disbelief, accepting the basic premise of the magical or dystopian world described, with Dickens one has to “go along with” his unique view of the world. Yes, he was writing about everyday characters and the highs and lows of their lives. His novels are very much rooted in reality, or they would not have had such an influence on legislation and the public perceptions of the day. But in a way they are also peopled with characters of fantasy. He will refer to “the fairy” or “the goblin” and this is how he views those characters. Their physical descriptions, mannerisms and behaviour all fit the type. Once you buy into the whole package, you realise that this is not a hopelessly sentimental or unrealistic view, but a fabulous tale of good versus evil with a great dollop of chance, and marvellous fairies and grotesques around every corner.\nAnd the characters? Oh, the characters! There are literally dozens of cameo pieces. They jump out of the book at every opportunity, these highly coloured images demanding attention, having but a brief, short life of perhaps a few paragraphs at most, before their vitality sizzles and dies, never again to be encountered by the reader. Who remembers Mr Slum, who was trying to persuade Mrs. Jarley to employ his services as a poet in helping to advertise the waxworks? Vividly described, he is actually based on a person Dickens remembered from his horrific days at Warren’s Blacking Factory. But he vanishes from the pages without trace. There is the unbearably snooty Miss Maltravers, the hypocritical monster of a teacher, with a crocodile of young ladies trailing in her wake. Unforgiveably, she makes Little Nell cry - and is then never seen again. There is Tom Scott, the only character in the entire novel, apart from Quilp’s downtrodden wife, who genuinely seems to like Quilp. Tom has a penchant for standing on his head and walking on his hands; he later becomes a professional tumbler. But often these characters appear for an instant, sparkle brightly, then disappear never to be be seen again.\nOn every page too, there is the fingerprint of the author, for Dickens has a unique way of telling a story. Even when describing a harrowing or tragic episode, he will still manage to somehow make the reader smile. In the main he does this through his characters, and he will also anthropomorphise his animals. Dickens will even personify objects or buildings; it is all grist to his mill of engaging his readers, and if at all possible, amusing us at the same time. His style combines exaggeration, hyperbole, sarcasm, irony, good humour, a sense of the absurd, a strong sense of injustice - all these combined in a formula which is essentially the recipe for the human condition, and reaches a pinnacle in the writing of “The Inimitable” Charles Dickens.\nOf course, all this can only be experienced through reading the text. The best dramatisation in the world cannot convey any of these linguistic devices. Yet Dickens’s stories are perennially popular, adapted for films, TV, radio and stage, and have been retold in numerous ways ever since they were written. Quite an achievement for an author whom some class as “dull”!\nSo what is the story about, and who are the main characters? Well the story started life as a series of sketches for Dickens’s weekly magazine, “Master Humphrey’s Clock”. Dickens’s original idea was that the magazine should be similar to “The Pickwick Papers”, with an old man surrounded by a group of friends, who would all relate stories to each other. They would all read out their own manuscripts, the proceedings being presided over by Master Humphrey. The magazine contained a few of these short stories, plus the first episodes of both The Old Curiosity Shop and later “Barnaby Rudge”. He had started to include a serial expressly because sales of the magazine had begun to drop. The public were disappointed by “Master Humphrey’s Clock”, but were quickly intrigued by the story of The Old Curiosity Shop. It captured the public’s imagination, and after Dickens had written the first three chapters, being the astute businessman that he was, with an eye for what whetted the public’s appetite, he decided to turn it into a full novel. Here is the author, in a preface to a later edition of the novel,\n“Master Humphrey (before his devotion to the bread and butter business) was originally supposed to be the narrator of the story. As it was constructed from the beginning, however, with a view to separate publication when completed, his demise has not involved the necessity of any alteration.”\nHe thus neatly got out of any rewriting, although a modern reader is left with an abandoned first person narrator at the end of chapter 3. From the reader’s point of view, the voice of the narrator has felt particularly personal up to that point. It is easy to recognise him, even from the very first words of the book,\n“Night is generally my time for walking.”\nNow anyone who knows anything about Charles Dickens’s life, will recognise the author from this. He used to walk for miles, and for hours on end, all over London - and often at night.\nThen in the novel the narrator tells us, at the end of the third chapter, that he is going to disappear, and from then on, presumably, we will have an omniscient narrator. Oddly, this works. Dickens has already created an atmosphere of mystery, tension and intrigue. We have two abominable grotesques, an old musty house full of “curiosities”, and a tiny “fairylike” child. We have been hooked right from the start by the questions the author/narrator also feels. Where does the old man go every night and why? And is he really rich? The upshot of these disjointed events is that the reader, who is already feeling an unworldly sense with this novel, is put on edge even more, and feels a little disturbed and dislocated. At this point it could easily turn into one of Dickens’s ghost stories.\nOnce Dickens had freed himself from the constraints of “Master Humphrey’s Clock”, he was able to give free rein to the story of The Old Curiosity Shop. He was free to expand on his original idea, increasing the suspense, and interweaving unforgettable characters into the action. There are the main characters, such as the malicious and shudderingly evil, hateful, misshapen, dwarf moneylender Daniel Quilp. Descriptions of him are abundant, always emphasising his sub-human qualities, threatening to “bite” people - and even the poor dog - all the time. When asleep he was,\n“hanging so far out of his bed that he almost seemed to be standing on his head, and whom, either from the uneasiness of this posture or in one of his agreeable habits, was gasping and growling with his mouth wide open, and the whites (or rather the dirty yellows) of his eyes distinctly visible.”\nQuilp revels in plotting the downfall of those around him, and maliciously making a misery of the lives of his nearest and dearest, his shadow of a wife Betsy and her mother Mrs Jiniwin. We meet Sampson and Sally Brass, lawyers, the obsequious brother and dragon of a sister, a sparring duo who provide much comic relief whilst being integral to the plot. Here is a portrait of the charming Sally, of whom, by the way, Quilp is much enamoured,\n”… the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations, which, if the imagination had been assisted by her attire, might have been mistaken for a beard. These were, however, in all probability, nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place, as the eyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural impertinencies. In complexion Miss Brass was sallow - rather a dirty sallow, so to speak - but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose.”\nThere are the young heroes, Dick Swiveller - often rather the worse for drink, disinclined to work, full of blather; a careless rogue, but essentially honest and true,\n“Mr Richard Swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion, which is considered by evil-minded men to be symbolical of intoxication, and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be,”\nand Kit Nubbins, a salt of the earth, devoted both to Nell and his mother, but not really very bright and easily taken advantage of. There are the Garlands, a kind and generous couple, who put the reader in mind of the benevolence of the Cheeryble brothers in “Nicholas Nickleby”. Eccentric characters abound, and many have the most wonderful names: Sophie Wackles, a flighty young girl, Codlin and Short, proprietor and puppeteer of a Punch and Judy show, Isaac List and Joe Jowl, crafty gamblers, Mr Chuckster, an annoying windbag, who is the Clerk to Mr Witherden, not to mention the renamed servant, “Sophronia Sphynx”.\nYet in this novel Dickens seeks to increase the mystery even further by deliberately keeping the names of some characters from us, sometimes right up to the end. There is “the Small Servant”, “the Marchioness”, “the Single Gentleman”, “the Bachelor”. And even Nell Trent’s grandfather, a pivotal character in the book, is not given a first name. “The fairy” is of course Little Nell, usually referred to as “the child”. “The goblin” is the grotesque dwarf Quilp, quite possibly the most evil villain ever to spring from Dickens’s pen. The parts containing these characters are the myth, the fairytale, the eternal struggle of good versus evil, the parts where we want to cheer on our heroes, our angels and fairies, and boo the goblins and baddies. It is also an unworldly doom-laden thread of the story. Simon Callow calls it,\n“an extraordinary and complex novel, which summons up an almost Wagnerian world with its dwarf and its gold, a cautionary tale about capitalism… It is astounding that Dickens should have whipped up this whole elaborate fable out of thin air, more or less overnight, quickly extrapolating it out of a little story he thought he might write about a sickly child and her grandfather, in order to keep faith with his public; he never pleased them more with anything.”\nIndeed, when published as a novel this gave fresh impetus to the serialisation. The mystery continued right through the story, now given added depth and complexity by virtue of its novel status. It took the public by storm, selling an astonishing hundred thousand copies a week, and for the last episode Dickens was inundated with letters from both sides of the Atlantic, begging him to spare Little Nell’s life. When the last instalment arrived by ship, crowds in New York were shouting from the pier, “Is Little Nell dead?” Dickens himself had had great difficulty in deciding this point, with so much of his public pleading for a reprieve. Even William Charles Macready, the great actor to whom Dickens had dedicated his previous novel, “Nicholas Nickleby” begged Dickens to let Little Nell live. Dickens’s friend, mentor and biographer, John Forster, advised the opposite, telling him that Little Nell should die, “so that the gentle little pure figure and form should never change to the fancy”.\nDickens finished writing The Old Curiosity Shop at 4am on January 17th, 1841. The story had been serialised for ten months, and Dickens had been in torment over the planned ending, unable to bring himself to write it, living the experience so vividly that he could not make his characters face the death of their heroine,\n“I tremble to approach the place a great deal more than Kit; a great deal more than Mr. Garland; a great deal more than the Single Gentleman… I am slowly murdering that poor child. It wrings my heart. Yet it must be.”\nThe whole depiction of Nell was a reworking of Mary Hogarth, Dickens’s real life sister-in-law who had died three years earlier at the age of 17. Dickens never really got over this loss, although there are indications in The Old Curiosity Shop that he was beginning to come to terms with it. There are several scenes set in a neglected graveyard, with Little Nell musing on thoughts of death. For much of the book she had been in a virtual trance - always wondering if she was awake or asleep - and this seemed to increase until she seemed to achieve a kind of serenity, and an acceptance of her fate. In the graveyard Nell, “grieves to think that those who die about us are so soon forgotten” but was told that unvisited graves were the inspiration of good thoughts and actions by those who remembered the ones who had died but who themselves went on living.\nOf course, the more obvious interpretations of the graveyard scenes are as portents and metaphors, foreshadowing what may be to come.\nTo a modern eye at least, there are many themes in the novel we may easily recognise. Alienation is a primary theme. Each character is in their own little world, often friendless, and with little power to influence their circumstances. Thus there is entrapment and loss of freedom. Creativity is there too, the creativity of Quilp to reinvent himself according to circumstances, and in the character of Dick Swiveller, to a lesser extent. It is tempting too to take a 21st century view of Quilp. What has happened to damage this character; to make him so intent on causing so much pain, devoting all his energies to planning destruction and ruin? Had he been abandoned or illtreated as a child? Was it other people’s perceptions of his difference or deformity which lay at the root of his behaviour? But the truth is probably that he was just Dickens’s “goblin”. Materialism is a paramount theme, naturally. The whole novel hinges on money - the lack of it, and the deceptions involved in acquiring it.\nThis novel is more similar to “Oliver Twist” than either of the other novels by Dickens which precede it. In both there is a naive and supremely good central character; in both it is a child who actually acts as if they are an adult. Nell may be “nearly 14” at the beginning of the novel, but is perceived by all as a child. And Dickens makes sure the reader never forgets this by constantly referring to her as “the child”. Both children have special qualities of innocence, forgiveness, endurance, and martyrdom. Both novels chronicle the journey of these children, and the events which ensue from that. In The Old Curiosity Shop we also follow the journey of Dick, which parallels it. Nell’s journey is a life and death one, Dick’s is more psychological, but they mirror each other to a great extent.\nIn both these novels we see two more of Dickens’s recurring themes. One is the damage done to children by foolish and reckless parents and grandparents. The other is the paradox of financial security. In Dickens’s world, if it has been gained at the expense of morality, it is meaningless and will result in a terrible fate. For Dickens both of these were private and personal wounds; episodes and paradoxes from his own life, which he constantly thrashed out in his own mind, and made his characters play out. Was it ever possible to live a morally good life and also keep safe and well?\nDickens interpolated episodes from his own fancy - the circus troupe, the waxworks and so on. All of these enjoyably entertaining episodes are Dickens indulging his whimsy, his penchant for all things theatrical. But the grim industrial scenes of the furnaces, based on those in Birmingham at the time; the grinding poverty and scenes of individuals trapped in a living death, are depressingly real. In these we have a glimpse of the Dickens who is to write the truly great socially aware novels of his middle period.\nPerhaps the best description of the effective formula for writing a serialised novel such as The Old Curiosity Shop comes from Wilkie Collins. Now we remember him from his own classic novels. But in this context, he was Charles Dickens’s friend, and a fellow writer who had his material published in Dickens’s magazines. His advice to writers hoping to be included in Dickens’s magazine?\n“Make them laugh, make them cry, make them wait.”\nWith The Old Curiosity Shop we have exactly that experience - in abundance. Plus in the final chapter we have, as always, a satisfying explanation of what has happened to all the main characters. Even the cantankerous and self-willed horse “Whiskers”, whose antics more than once released the tension from a particularly harrowing part of the story, is given his own summing-up, his own “happy ending” in the final chapter. Oscar Wilde may have remarked,  “One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Nell without laughing” , but if the reader has been caught up in the throes of the story, with all its tragedies and all its absurdities, then even now the reader is more likely to feel akin to those crowds on the New York Pier.\nSo, does it actually exist, this “Old Curiosity Shop”? Well, yes. In all probability it is a building on Portsmouth Street, Holborn, London. It was built in 1567, and Dickens often used to visit it. Later it was named “The Old Curiosity Shop” in honour of his novel, and is now quite famous."},"02_areas/CHINESE/Untitled-1":{"title":"Untitled 1","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"上曳\n短歌行\n背\n周树人- 字豫才\n药-《呐喊》里\n祝福-《彷徨》里\n《狂人日记》《阿Q正传》-《呐喊》里 - 第一篇现代白话文小说\n欧 亨利- 世界三大短篇小说之王\n契诃(he)夫\n《史记 鸿门宴》\n《过秦论》/《阿房宫赋》\n《洛神赋》\n《上y》- 只用背\n《短歌行》\n《孔雀东南飞》\n乐府/古诗十九首\ndo pre 作文memorize"},"02_areas/CHINESE/Untitled-2":{"title":"Untitled 2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Here is a detailed English translation of the historical account, preserving all original details:\n\nLiu Bang stationed his army at Bashang and had not yet met Xiang Yu. Cao Wushang, an official in charge of military affairs under Liu Bang, sent a messenger to Xiang Yu, saying: “Liu Bang intends to proclaim himself King of Guanzhong, appoint Ziying as his chancellor, and seize all treasures for himself.” Enraged, Xiang Yu declared: “Tomorrow, feast the soldiers! We shall crush Liu Bang’s army!” At this time, Xiang Yu commanded 400,000 troops stationed at Hongmen in Xinfeng, while Liu Bang had only 100,000 men at Bashang.\nFan Zeng, Xiang Yu’s strategist, urged him: “When the Duke of Pei (Liu Bang) was east of the Yao Mountains, he coveted wealth and indulged in women. Yet now, upon entering the Pass, he neither seizes riches nor pursues pleasure—this reveals grand ambitions. I had a diviner observe the aura above his camp: it took the form of dragons and tigers, radiant with five colors—the aura of a Son of Heaven! Strike now, lest we lose this opportunity.”\nXiang Bo, Xiang Yu’s uncle and the Left Yin of Chu, who was friendly with Zhang Liang (then serving Liu Bang), secretly rode overnight to Liu Bang’s camp. He privately informed Zhang Liang: “Join me in fleeing. Do not perish with them!” Zhang Liang replied: “I escorted the Duke of Pei into the Pass on behalf of the King of Han. To abandon him in crisis would betray righteousness. I must inform him.”\nZhang Liang reported everything to Liu Bang, who panicked: “What shall I do?” Zhang Liang asked: “Who advised you to blockade Hangu Pass?” Liu Bang answered: “A fool told me: ‘Secure the Pass against the nobles, and all Qin lands will be yours.’ Thus I followed his plan.” Zhang Liang pressed: “Can your forces match Xiang Yu’s?” After a long silence, Liu Bang admitted: “No. What now?” Zhang Liang proposed: “Let me explain to Xiang Bo that you dare not defy Xiang Yu.”\nWhen Liu Bang learned of Xiang Bo’s prior friendship with Zhang Liang (who once saved Xiang Bo from execution during Qin rule), he insisted on hosting Xiang Bo as an elder brother. Liu Bang toasted Xiang Bo, proposed a marriage alliance between their families, and explained: “I entered Guanzhong without taking a single possession—I registered officials and citizens, sealed treasuries, and await Lord Xiang’s arrival. The Hangu Pass garrison was only to guard against bandits. How could I rebel? Please convey my loyalty to Xiang Yu.” Xiang Bo agreed and advised Liu Bang: “Apologize personally to Xiang Yu at dawn tomorrow.”\nXiang Bo returned to camp and persuaded Xiang Yu: “Liu Bang secured Guanzhong for you. Attacking him now would be dishonorable. Treat him kindly instead.” Xiang Yu consented.\nThe next morning, Liu Bang arrived at Hongmen with over 100 horsemen and apologized: “You fought north of the Yellow River; I fought south. I never expected to enter Guanzhong first and destroy Qin. Now, slander has divided us.” Xiang Yu revealed: “Your officer Cao Wushang said this. Else, why would I be angry?”\nDuring the banquet, Xiang Yu and Xiang Bo sat facing east; Fan Zeng (honored as “Second Father”) faced south; Liu Bang faced north; Zhang Liang attended facing west. Fan Zeng repeatedly signaled Xiang Yu by raising his jade jue (a broken-ring symbolizing decisive action), but Xiang Yu ignored him. Fan Zeng then summoned Xiang Zhuang (a swordsman): “Our lord is too merciful. Toast Liu Bang, then pretend to perform a sword dance and kill him!”\nXiang Zhuang entered, toasted, and requested to entertain with swordplay. Xiang Yu approved. As Xiang Zhuang danced with drawn sword, Xiang Bo rose to join, shielding Liu Bang with his own body and blocking all assassination attempts.\nZhang Liang rushed to the camp gate for Fan Kuai, Liu Bang’s bodyguard. Fan Kuai demanded: “How dire is it?” Zhang Liang warned: “Xiang Zhuang’s sword targets the Duke!” Fan Kuai burst into the tent with sword and shield, knocking down guards. He glared at Xiang Yu, hair bristling, eyes wide.\nXiang Yu praised: “A warrior! Give him wine and a pork leg!” Fan Kuai drank the wine in one gulp, then ate the raw meat on his shield. When challenged to drink more, he retorted: “I fear no death! The Qin tyrant slaughtered endlessly, so all rebelled. King Huai vowed: ‘He who enters Xianyang first shall rule Guanzhong.’ The Duke of Pei took Xianyang yet touched nothing, awaiting you. Instead of reward, you heed lies to kill him—this is to follow Qin’s cruelty!”\nXiang Yu had no reply. Liu Bang excused himself to the latrine, taking Fan Kuai. Outside, he debated fleeing without formal farewell. Fan Kuai argued: “Great deeds ignore trifles. We are fish on a chopping block—why courtesies?” Liu Bang left secretly via Mount Li and the Zhiyang path with four guards, instructing Zhang Liang to present gifts: “A pair of jade discs for Xiang Yu; jade cups for Fan Zeng.”\nWhen Zhang Liang later presented the gifts, Xiang Yu accepted the discs. Fan Zeng smashed the cups in fury: “Alas! Foolish boy! The empire will go to Liu Bang. We are all his captives now!”\nUpon returning to camp, Liu Bang immediately executed Cao Wushang for treason.\n\nThis translation preserves all historical figures, locations, dialogues, symbolic acts (e.g., the jade jue), military numbers, and strategic nuances from the original text about the Hongmen Banquet, a pivotal event in the Chu-Han Contention (206–202 BCE)."},"02_areas/CHINESE/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"诗经\n子衿"},"02_areas/CHINESE/Wednesday-Test-Revision":{"title":"Wednesday Test

，双方兵力悬殊（项羽四十万，刘邦十万），\n\n作者：司马迁，选自《史记·项羽本纪》\n事发地点：新丰鸿门，今陕西\n重要人物：\n\n\n刘邦： 善于用人，能屈能伸，工于心计。在鸿门宴上，他言辞谦卑，以退为进，成功迷惑项羽，化险为夷。\n刘邦字季，出身低微\n\n\n项羽： 武力超群，但刚愎自用、优柔寡断。虽在军事上占尽优势，却在鸿门宴上不听从范增建议，错失杀刘邦的良机。\n项羽 姬姓 项氏  名籍字羽，出身名门\n\n\n范增：项羽的谋士，老谋深算，深知刘邦对项羽的威胁，极力主张在鸿门宴上铲除刘邦。\n\n\n张良：刘邦的主要谋士，足智多谋，临危不乱，为刘邦出谋划策，周旋于项羽阵营。\n\n\n樊哙：刘邦的部将，勇猛豪爽，在鸿门宴上闯入营帐，斥责项羽，使刘邦得以脱身。\n\n\n项伯：项羽的叔父，因与张良交好，在鸿门宴前夕私告张良，还在宴会上保护刘邦\n\n\n\n\n写作手法：\t通过（此处为sentence or one word）人物的语言、动作、神态等描写，使人物形象栩栩如生，跃然纸\n中心主题：\n司马迁通过鸿门宴上刘邦与项羽双方的斗争，揭示了项羽自矜功伐而有 “妇人之仁”，最终导致失败；\n刘邦能审时度势、善于用人，最终成就帝业。\n同时，也展现了在政治斗争中，人心、智谋、策略等因素的重要性。\n\n《过秦论》\n《过秦论》属于史论，用于评论历史、总结教训。 作者是西汉贾谊，其中“过秦”译为指出秦国的过失。（背背背）\n文章内容以及主旨：（背吧孩子）\n\n内容：文章先叙述秦自秦孝公崛起，历经多代君主发展，到秦始皇时统一六国，势力达到极盛；而后讲述秦朝迅速灭亡，陈胜等起义，秦朝覆灭 。\n主旨：通过对秦兴衰过程的叙述和分析，指出秦朝灭亡的原因是 “仁义不施而攻守之势异也”，意在告诫当时统治者要施行仁政，避免重蹈秦亡覆辙。\n\n地理位置：（可能会考）\n\n崤函指崤山和函谷关，崤山在函谷关东边；\n八荒指八方最偏远之地，代指天下，\n此外四海、六合等词也可表示天下。\n九州常代指 “中国”，一般包括兖州、冀州等九个区域。\n\n（需了解）：\n\n连横（衡） 是秦国离间六国，使其各自与秦联合的策略；\n合从（纵） 是六国联合抗秦的策略\n万乘指兵车万辆 ，可表示军事力量强大或代指天子；\n七庙隳意味着宗庙毁灭、国家灭亡 。\n一词多义：\t（翻译题可能会考）\n“固” 有 “险要的地势”（据崤函之固）、“牢固”（君臣固守以窥周室）等义\n“亡” 有 “丢失”（秦无亡矢遗镞之费）、“使…… 灭亡”（吞二周而亡诸侯）等义。\n古今异义：\n“于是秦人拱手而取西河之外” 中 “于是” 古义为 “在这种情况下”\n“山东豪俊遂并起而亡秦族矣” 中 “山东” 古义是 “崤山以东” 等 。\n\n\n《阿房宫赋》\n作者杜牧，晚唐诗人\n创作背景：\t写于唐敬宗宝历元年（825），当时政治腐败，藩镇跋扈，边疆受扰，人民痛苦。唐敬宗荒淫无度，大兴宫室，杜牧借此赋批判统治者的骄奢淫逸，希望统治者能励精图治，其批判锋芒不仅指向秦等亡国之君，更指向当时的最高统治者。（通过秦的灭亡照应当朝统治者的所作所为）\n作者通过对秦建造阿房宫时压榨百姓，大肆耗财的描写，总结历史教训，发出 “灭六国者六国也，非秦也；族秦者秦也，非天下也” 的论断，指出统治者若不爱惜百姓，必将走向灭亡，借此向唐朝统治者提出警告，体现作者忧国忧民的情怀。\n关于写作手法（考试考了就这么写）\n\n铺排夸张：大量使用铺陈排比的手法，如描写阿房宫建筑的宏伟、宫中生活的奢靡，“使负栋之柱，多于南亩之农夫……”，同时运用夸张，如 “覆压三百余里，隔离天日”，增强感染力。\n骈散结合：句式上骈句和散句交错使用，骈句工整华美，散句灵活多变，使文章富有节奏感和韵律美。（其实就是长短句）\n想象丰富：作者凭借想象，生动再现阿房宫的壮丽景象，如对宫殿建筑、宫女生活等的描写，极具画面感\n\n然后还有一份文常大家也可以看看\n￼Open: image.png\n\nOpen:

qǐ首：较“顿首”礼节更重，头碰地时停留的时间较“顿首”长。\n再拜：拜了又拜。\n三、重点字词\n1、素善留侯张良——亲善，跟…要好。\n2、项伯杀人，臣活之——使之活，使他免于死罪。\n3、旦日不可不蚤自来谢项王——通“早”\n4、会其怒，不敢献——正赶上，恰巧\n5、约从离衡——通“纵”\n6、信臣精卒陈利兵而谁何——通“呵”，呵喝。\n7、赢粮而景从——同“影”\n8、因遗策——沿袭\n9、以致天下之士——招致，招纳\n四、简答题\n1、如果项羽在鸿门宴杀了刘邦，你认为故事的走向会是什么样的?如果项羽统一天下，建立一个“楚朝”, 你认为他会如何统治这个国家?\n（1）\n刘邦的死可能会让项羽得意忘形， 更加自大和野心勃勃。 项羽本就以傲慢和自大闻名，在他看来， 杀死刘邦将成为他权力无可匹敌的证明。 他可能会将刘邦的死视为自己军队无敌的象征，更加自信地行动。这种得意和傲慢可能导致他更加独断专行，更加残暴和高傲。\n（2）\n沉重打击了汉军，汉军会陷入混乱和分裂。刘邦是汉军的实际创始人和领袖，他不仅具备卓越的智谋和统一能力， 而且深受军队和民众的尊重和拥护。 没有了刘邦的存在， 汉军可能会失去一个核心的指导者和统一的力量， 面临内部的权力争夺和冲突。 各个势力可能会试图在刘邦死后填补权力真空，进一步削弱他们对项羽的抵抗能力。\n（3）\n汉朝或许不会建立。刘邦是汉朝的奠基人，他的统一中国的理念和政治智慧是汉朝得以建立的重要原因。 如果刘邦遭到暗杀， 汉朝的建立过程可能会变得艰难曲折， 甚至出现失败的可能。 各个势力可能会重新崛起， 导致战乱和分裂局面的出现。 不过， 刘邦的死可能会让人们对项羽的统治产生怀疑， 进而触发民众的反抗和反思， 这可能为汉朝的重建提供了机会。\n（4）\n刘邦死后，项羽可能面临统治中国的更大挑战。尽管刘邦的死给了项羽更大的自由和权利， 但他也面临着巨大的管治和统治难题。 刘邦在政治上具备了丰富的经验和智慧， 而项羽则缺乏这方面的能力。 在试图统治一个广阔的国家和庞大的人口时， 项羽可能面临内外的困难。\n2、从《阿房宫赋》中反映出的杜牧形象：\n①为国为民的深沉忧患意识与强烈的社会责任感。\n②纵横驰骋的想象力和文采\n③敢于直击时弊的谏诤精神\n3、把课文中“有……之意，……之心”句换成“有吞并天下之心”似乎也通，但作者为什么要舍简就繁呢？\n意在突出秦孝公吞并六国、 独占天下的勃勃雄心以及秦对诸侯各国虎视眈眈的情态、 咄咄逼人的气势。 同时也为后文写孝公之后的历代秦君的赫赫功业张本， 为后文写秦一统天下之后的顷刻覆亡形成对比并作了铺垫。\n4、贾谊认为，秦朝灭亡的原因是“仁义不施而攻守之势异也”。从文中你还能读出秦朝灭亡的其他原因吗？请结合文本加以探究。\n【观点一】滥用武力是主因。秦朝在统一过程中，依靠自身的武力，大肆征伐；在统一天下之后，又北征匈奴，南征百越。久战力竭，顾外而不顾内，是其灭亡主因。\n【观点二】 滥用民力是主因。 秦朝在统一天下之后， 筑长城， 建阿房， 修骊宫， 劳民而伤财，百姓得不到休养生息，农业得不到大力发展，这是主要原因。\n【观点三】 骄傲自大是主因。 秦朝在统一天下之后， 践华为城， 因河为池， 自以为关中之固，金城千里，子孙帝王万世之业，骄傲自大使其失去天下。\n5、课文运用哪些表达技巧？\n①比喻 “明星荧荧，开妆镜也；绿云扰扰，梳晓鬟也”\n“倚叠如山”“雷霆乍惊，宫车过也”\n②排比 “明星荧荧，开妆镜也；绿云扰扰，\n梳晓鬟也；渭流涨腻，弃脂水也……”\n6、 有人认为项羽不在席间杀死刘邦，体现了他的“妇人之仁”(《淮阴侯列传》)，但苏轼认为这体现了他的“君人之度”(统治人民应有的度量)，你对此怎么认为?\n观点一:项羽虽然是一个叱咤风云的盖世英雄，但从宴席前和宴席上的表现来看，他是一个优柔寡断、感情用事的人，说他有“妇人之仁”有一定的道理。\n观点二:说项羽在宴席上“优柔寡断”是不准确的。他的叔父项伯替刘邦向他表功和求情之后,项羽实际上就有不杀刘邦之意。 正因为项羽有自己的想法,所以， 对范增的再三暗示置若罔闻，对项伯的庇护加以纵容。项羽是一个狂妄自大、刚愎自用的人，说他有“妇人之仁”是不准确的。\n观点三:什么是“君人之度”?就是统治者的宽广的气度，对臣下的过错也能够容忍和宽恕。项羽答应“内奸”项伯的求情，相信刘邦的连篇鬼话,根本不是什么“君人之度”,而只能说是缺乏知人之明,缺乏审时度势的智慧。 有人说项羽 “四肢发达， 头脑简单”,不是没有道理的。"},"02_areas/CHINESE/chinese-test-记叙文":{"title":"chinese test 记叙文","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"根据您提供的作品，精选五首最具生死离别意象的经典作品，并为其分别创作三幕叙事框架：\n■

前传《雪夜辞行》\n建安二十三年冬，洛阳粮曹掾张衍受命押送军粮至淮南前线。临行前夜，他跪别病榻上的老母，将祖传双鹄玉佩赠予青梅竹马的崔氏女郎。风雪漫卷的灞桥边，崔氏连夜织就的素锦披风犹带织机余温。城头戍鼓催发，张衍望着冰封的洛水发誓：“待大河解冻日，必驾青骢还乡迎卿。”\n■ 诗境重写《寒江孤影》\n建初四年春，徐州流民杜衡徘徊在泗水东岸。褡裢里半块黍饼已硬如铁石，对岸炊烟里仿佛飘来未婚妻阿沅的捣衣声。昨夜他冒险泅渡，却被渔阳突至的冰凌割伤左腿。此刻他解下腰间竹笛，吹起《鹡鸰曲》——那是他们当年在麦垛间约定的归家暗号。暮色中，对岸某处茅檐忽有白绢轻扬，如垂死的鹤翅。\n■ 后续《纸鸢渡》\n光和七年秋，老艄公在汴河口捞起具缚着石锁的尸骸，腐衣内藏有前朝双鹄佩。当夜，疯妇崔氏闯入河神庙，将浸透河泥的玉佩系在丈八纸鸢上。飓风过境时，万千百姓目睹纸鸢化作金翼玄鸟，抓起老妇冲霄而去。自此每逢雨雪，渡口便回响着机杼声与男子呢喃：“水浅处无桥，云深处有路。”\n\n《孔雀东南飞》三重变奏\n■ 前传《纨素劫》\n永初三年，庐江刘氏绣坊突遭祝融之灾。十五岁的兰芝从火场抢出半幅未成的孔雀朝霞帔，烟灰入肺落下咳疾。这场火断送了刘家皇商资格，却让焦仲卿在赈灾时结识了灰烬中刺绣的少女。他不知那火是焦母派人所纵——她早相中秦罗敷为媳，只因秦家掌握着蜀锦秘染术。\n■ 诗核重构《金镂鞍》\n新婚夜，兰芝在嫁衣内层绣满《璇玑图》，暗藏”蒲苇韧如丝”的誓言。被遣归那日，她故意将嫁衣反穿，金线牡丹在朝阳下灼伤焦母双眼。太守下聘时，她要求三百匹茜纱不是为制衣，而是串联成赤练悬于中庭。当夜东风急，三百匹红纱化作流火，裹着新妇如涅槃凤鸟坠入莲池。\n■ 后世《连理刑》\n景耀六年，东吴刑吏在华山墓旁捕获盗柏贼，竟是焦、刘后人。他们供认世代在此盗取墓木——凡取东南枝制琴者，弦响时可见双雀投怀；斫西北干为棺者，尸身经年不腐。孙权闻讯欲毁墓，却见墓中飞出铜雀衔着半幅血书：“东南枝可斫，西北干可断，中有连理木，天地不能判。“遂立此木为刑杖，专笞负心之人。\n\n生死美学三境\n■

Which scene/event left the most impression?\nThe most haunting scene in these chapters is Nell and her grandfather’s midnight flight from the Old Curiosity Shop. Dickens crafts this moment with palpable suspense, juxtaposing the eerie silence of London’s streets against the desperation driving their escape. The shop itself, cluttered with decaying relics, mirrors the grandfather’s moral decay and the fragility of Nell’s innocence. What lingers is the grandfather’s deluded obsession: his whispered promises to secure Nell’s future through gambling, contrasted with her quiet resolve to protect him. The introduction of Quilp, the grotesque dwarf, amplifies the tension. His invasion of the shop—gnawing on a giant lobster, taunting Nell with leering cruelty—embodies predatory greed. The narrative shift from the cryptic first-person narrator (Chapters 1–3) to an omniscient voice further destabilizes the reader, mirroring Nell’s dislocation. This structural choice underscores Dickens’ thematic focus: the vulnerability of innocence in a world where even family can become a destructive force. The grandfather’s duality—gentle yet monstrous—echoes the shop’s decay, making their flight a visceral symbol of moral and physical ruin.\n2. Did you like it or not?\nThe opening chapters are a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling, though uneven in execution. Dickens excels at building tension: the shadowy curiosity shop, Quilp’s malevolence, and the grandfather’s secretive gambling create a Gothic undertone. Nell’s quiet strength—contrasted with her grandfather’s weakness—adds emotional depth. However, the abrupt narrative shift from first- to third-person perspective is jarring, a relic of Dickens’ initial plan to serialize the story within Master Humphrey’s Clock. While this transition disrupts immersion, it ultimately allows broader exploration of secondary characters like Kit and the Brasses. The grandfather’s complexity is compelling; his love for Nell is genuine, yet his addiction renders him morally bankrupt, a nuanced critique of Victorian familial duty. Quilp, though cartoonishly evil, electrifies every scene, embodying capitalism’s voracity. Yet the sentimentality surrounding Nell—her “too pure for this world” archetype—feels contrived, a flaw that would plague the novel. Despite these hiccups, the early chapters succeed in blending social critique with suspense, setting the stage for Nell’s tragic odyssey.\n3. What do you think will happen next?\nHaving fled London, Nell and her grandfather will likely face escalating hardships. Quilp’s relentless pursuit—fueled by spite and greed—will force them into deeper isolation. The grandfather’s gambling may resurface, compounding their vulnerability. The countryside, initially a refuge, may reveal its own dangers: exploitative strangers, industrial blight, or the grandfather’s deteriorating mental state. Dickens might contrast rural idylls with urban corruption, critiquing Victorian industrialization.\n\nPart 2: Pursuit and Hardship (Chapters 24–53)\n1. Characters Appeared\nKey characters now include Nell, her grandfather, Quilp, Kit Nubbles, Sampson and Sally Brass, Dick Swiveller, the Marchioness, Mrs. Jarley, and the Single Gentleman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter TypeNames/Descriptions (up to Ch. 53)MainNell, Grandfather, Quilp, Kit, Brasses, SwivellerSupportingFrederick Trent, Garlands, Witherden, Marton, etcMinor/ComicMrs. Quilp, Tom Scott, Codlin, Short, etc.\n2. Character Analysis: Daniel Quilp\nDaniel Quilp stands out as Dickens’ most grotesque and unforgettable villain. A hunchbacked dwarf with a “mouth so wide he could swallow a human head,” Quilp embodies pure malice. His cruelty is both physical—biting, spitting, torturing his wife—and psychological, as he relishes manipulating others’ despair. Quilp’s obsession with Nell is not sexual but predatory; he seeks to dominate and destroy her innocence, symbolizing capitalism’s dehumanizing greed. His mockery of societal norms (e.g., pretending to hang himself for amusement) underscores his moral deformity. Yet Quilp is also darkly charismatic, a perverse inversion of Victorian respectability. His death—drowning while fleeing justice—is richly symbolic: the Thames, a site of industrial pollution, claims him, reflecting Dickens’ critique of unchecked avarice. Quilp’s legacy lies in his ability to expose the rot beneath Victorian propriety, making him a timeless emblem of human corruption.\n\nPart 3: Resolution and Fate (Chapters 54–73)\n1. Author’s Message and Techniques\nDickens critiques Victorian society’s moral decay through Nell’s tragic arc. Her death—a result of her grandfather’s obsession and Quilp’s predation—symbolizes the destruction of innocence by greed and addiction. The grandfather’s madness reflects the futility of material obsession, while Quilp’s downfall underscores the self-destructive nature of malice. Dickens contrasts Nell’s purity with industrial blight (e.g., the furnaces of Birmingham) to highlight humanity’s erosion in an age of progress. The Brasses’ schemes and forced marriage plots expose systemic corruption, where law and family alike exploit the vulnerable. Nell’s pilgrimage to the rural church offers fleeting solace, but her demise in its shadow signals Dickens’ bleak view of redemption in a mercenary world. Through melodrama and pathos, he urges compassion, yet the unresolved fates of characters like Frederick Trent reveal his ambivalence about societal reform.\n\nFinal Evaluation (300 words)\nThe Old Curiosity Shop is a flawed yet compelling work, emblematic of Dickens’ early genius and excesses. Its strengths lie in vivid characterizations: Quilp’s grotesque villainy, Swiveller’s redemption, and Nell’s martyrdom resonate deeply. The multi-plot structure, honed in Nicholas Nickleby, weaves humor and tragedy effectively, with Kit’s loyalty balancing Nell’s sorrow. Dickens’ social critique—targeting gambling, greed, and industrialization—remains potent, particularly in scenes of urban squalor.\nHowever, the novel falters in its sentimentality. Nell’s death, while poignant, verges on manipulative, a flaw Oscar Wilde famously mocked. The rushed resolution of subplots (e.g., Frederick Trent’s disappearance) and Quilp’s anticlimactic demise weaken the narrative. Yet these missteps are mitigated by Dickens’ empathetic prose and structural ambition. The shift from serialized vignettes to a unified novel reflects his growing confidence, even if the opening perspective change jars.\nComparatively, The Old Curiosity Shop lacks the polish of Great Expectations but surpasses Oliver Twist in emotional complexity. Nell, though passive, drives the plot through her resilience, a nuanced contrast to Oliver’s victimhood. The novel’s exploration of familial destruction—a grandfather’s love twisted into harm—adds psychological depth. While its length and melodrama test patience, the book remains a vital critique of Victorian hypocrisy, blending Gothic horror with social realism. For all its flaws, Dickens’ humanity shines through, making it a poignant, if uneven, masterpiece.\n\nWhy the Narrative Shift?\nThe abrupt shift from first- to third-person perspective stems from Dickens’ initial plan to serialize the story within Master Humphrey’s Clock. When reader demand focused on Nell, he abandoned the framing device, allowing broader narrative scope but sacrificing cohesion. This pivot highlights his adaptability and the commercial pressures of serial publication.\nImpact of Dickens’ Earlier Novels\nThe Old Curiosity Shop synthesizes elements from prior works: the episodic structure of Pickwick Papers, the social critique of Oliver Twist, and the melodramatic villains of Nicholas Nickleby. Its multi-plot structure and focus on childhood innocence reveal Dickens refining his style, paving the way for later masterpieces like David Copperfield.\nIndustrialization and Humanity\nThe novel contrasts rural innocence with industrial decay. Nell’s journey through soot-choked towns mirrors the erosion of communal bonds in an industrialized society, critiquing progress at the cost of morality. Her death in a pastoral churchyard underscores the futility of seeking purity in a corrupted world."},"02_areas/CHINESE/draft2":{"title":"draft2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens: A Thematic and Structural Analysis\n\nPart 1: Narrative Shifts and the Weight of Isolation\nNarrative Perspective Shift\nThe novel begins with an unnamed first-person narrator, creating an intimate, mysterious tone as they encounter Nell in the Old Curiosity Shop. This framing device dissolves abruptly in Chapter 4, transitioning to a third-person omniscient perspective. Dickens’s shift reflects the novel’s origin as part of Master Humphrey’s Clock, a serial anthology he later abandoned to focus solely on Nell’s story. The change allows broader exploration of intertwining plotlines (e.g., Quilp’s villainy, Kit’s plight) while heightening emotional stakes. The initial first-person voice establishes a gothic unease, immersing readers in the shop’s claustrophobic atmosphere, while the omniscient narrator amplifies the story’s epic, moral dimensions.\nNell Alone in the Shop: Vulnerability and Foreboding\nThe scene of Nell alone at night underscores her isolation and fragility. Surrounded by decaying relics—a metaphor for her grandfather’s crumbling morality—she embodies innocence besieged by darkness. Dickens juxtaposes her childlike wonder with the shop’s grotesque curiosities (e.g., suits of armor “standing bolt upright in corners” with “no speculation in their eyes”), foreshadowing her perilous journey. This moment crystallizes the novel’s tension between innocence and corruption, as Nell’s quiet resilience contrasts with the predatory world outside.\nQuilp’s Introduction: Grotesque Villainy\nQuilp’s entrance is a masterclass in grotesquerie. Described as a “hideous dwarf” with “so much of the devil” in him, he embodies unrestrained malice. His first appearance—leering, biting coins, and tormenting his wife—establishes him as a force of chaos. Unlike the grandfather’s self-deluding obsession, Quilp’s cruelty is calculated, a reflection of industrial capitalism’s dehumanizing greed. His takeover of the shop symbolizes the erosion of familial sanctity by external exploitation, setting the stage for Nell’s flight.\n\nPart 2: The Single Gentleman and the Destructive Power of Family\nThe Single Gentleman’s Role and Revelation\nThe Single Gentleman, introduced as a mysterious figure fixated on locating Nell, embodies Dickens’s critique of fragmented families. His relentless pursuit mirrors Quilp’s but is driven by redemption rather than greed. The revelation of his identity as Nell’s estranged great-uncle in Chapter 53 reframes the narrative: his belated intervention underscores the tragedy of familial neglect. While his arrival intensifies the search, it arrives too late, highlighting how societal and familial failures compound Nell’s suffering. His arc critiques Victorian patriarchy’s inability to protect the vulnerable, even when intentions are noble.\nCharacter Analysis: Dick Swiveller’s Redemption\nDick Swiveller emerges as the most compelling character in Part 2. Initially a comic foil—a debt-ridden, Shakespeare-quoting idler—he evolves into an unlikely hero. His bond with the Marchioness, the Brasses’ abused servant, catalyzes his growth. Swiveller’s humor (“‘A moral eh?’… ‘I’m afraid I’m too wicked!’”) masks a latent kindness, and his efforts to exonerate Kit reveal a moral awakening. Unlike Quilp’s static villainy, Swiveller’s arc exemplifies Dickens’s belief in redemption, blending wit and pathos. His dynamic nature contrasts with Nell’s passive purity, offering a nuanced counterpoint to the novel’s moral binaries.\n\nPart 3: Obsession and Societal Indifference\nThe Grandfather’s Gambling: A Catalyst for Ruin\nThe grandfather’s obsession with securing Nell’s future through gambling epitomizes self-destructive love. His secretive nighttime ventures and delusional belief in a “winning streak” parallel Quilp’s greed, but his motives are tragically misplaced. Dickens critiques how obsession, even born of love, corrodes familial bonds. The grandfather’s descent into madness after Nell’s death (“he sat by her grave, day and night”) underscores the futility of his actions, framing him as both victim and perpetrator.\nVictorian Society’s Moral Bankruptcy\nThe novel indicts institutions that fail the vulnerable. Kit’s wrongful arrest—orchestrated by Quilp and the venal lawyer Brass—exposes a legal system swayed by wealth over justice. Nell’s encounters with exploitative figures (e.g., Codlin and Short’s puppet show, who initially plan to profit from her story) reflect a society indifferent to suffering. Even Mrs. Jarley’s waxworks, a temporary refuge, commodify human tragedy as spectacle. Dickens contrasts these failures with pockets of compassion (e.g., the schoolmaster who shelters Nell), advocating for collective responsibility.\nSynthesis: Obsession and Neglect\nThe grandfather’s obsession and Quilp’s avarice are two sides of the same coin, both destructive forces enabled by a society that prizes individualism over empathy. Nell’s death—a result of her grandfather’s misguided love and society’s neglect—serves as a polemic against systemic indifference. Dickens links personal vice to broader societal rot, urging reform through empathy.\n\nEvaluation: Strengths and Shortcomings\nAppreciation\nThe novel excels in its rich characterizations and social critique. Quilp’s theatrical villainy and Swiveller’s redemption arc showcase Dickens’s flair for blending humor and pathos. The parallel plotlines—Nell’s odyssey, Kit’s tribulations, Swiveller’s growth—reflect Dickens’s maturing narrative skill, weaving disparate threads into a cohesive moral tapestry. The Old Curiosity Shop’s setting, inspired by a real Holborn building, grounds the story in a tangible, decaying Victorian London.\nCritique\nThe melodramatic ending—Nell’s protracted death, criticized even by contemporaries like Wilde—strains credibility, reflecting Dickens’s sentimentality. Subplots, like Frederick Trent’s abrupt disappearance, feel underdeveloped, while the grandfather’s erratic behavior sometimes veers into incoherence. The novel’s length and episodic structure test pacing, though they mirror its serial origins.\nComparative Context\nLike Oliver Twist, The Old Curiosity Shop highlights childhood innocence besieged, but Nell’s agency (e.g., initiating their flight) contrasts with Oliver’s passivity. Both novels critique institutional failures, but Shop implicates familial love as potentially destructive. Its darker tone and unresolved tensions mark Dickens’s progression toward mature works like Bleak House.\n\nConclusion: A flawed Masterpiece\nThe Old Curiosity Shop remains vital for its unflinching exploration of obsession and societal cruelty. While its sentimentality and loose ends reflect Dickens’s evolving style, its strengths—memorable characters, moral urgency, and vivid settings—outweigh its flaws. The novel’s critique of Victorian hypocrisy and its plea for compassion resonate today, cementing its place as a bridge between Dickens’s early humor and later social realism. Recommended for readers seeking a poignant, if uneven, journey into the heart of human frailty."},"02_areas/CHINESE/draftthoughts":{"title":"draftthoughts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"However, I found it to be quite quaint. Not perfect, but quaint.\nThe reason why this book isn’t perfect lies in how it was published originally — in serial form. Basically, whenever Dickens was backed into a corner that he didn’t like, he simply changed things mid-stream without needing to go back and revise the manuscript from the outset. Thus, we have a male narrator that disappears from the book about four chapters in because need of having the narrator around for all of the action didn’t suit the story — so off he went. (The disappearance is covered by Dickens in an appendix in a fashion that doesn’t make too much sense.) Same goes, I assume, for a marriage sub-plot surrounding Nell early on. It is mentioned, and then brushed aside for a different change of tactic.\nThe beginning of the book involves the Old Curiosity Shop but the shop itself has no real importance in the rest of the story. It serves as a connection point for many of the main characters but there is not much relevance to later events.\nI loved to hate Quilp! He was such a dark and sinister character, purely motivated by revenge and schadenfreude. He stirred strong emotions in me - surely a sign of great writing.\nI loved Kit and his family and his relationship with the Garlands. He somehow managed to be honest and wholesome without becoming too righteous or unsympathetic. He was the star of the show for me!\nSampson and Sally Brass and Dick Swiveller were also entertaining. Sally’s character was a bit of an enigma and the prevailing mystery of her relationship with Quilp and the Marchioness was a clever touch.\nAs usual, Dickens’ characters were wonderful - the folk Nell and her Grandfather met along the way were a great mix of comic, ill-intentioned or kind hearted. The portrayal of the countryside provided an interesting contrast with more heavily industrialised areas through which they travel and the different types of poverty and hardship witnessed in these different environments.\nTROPES\nable to fit lots of em\nI think the Grandfather, and not Quilp, is the true villain of the story.

清醒认识自己时，才能做出准确的判断，况且世间之事本来就是真假，\n善恶难辩，这里姑且不讨论谁对谁错。 当世界上只有两个人的时候，他们就是亚当和夏娃。他们生活在伊甸园内，那里不仅环境优雅，而且不需劳动就可丰衣足食，没有烦恼。 但他们仍不满意，偷食禁果，身受其害。原来他们也并不完美，他们 有贪欲，有很强的好奇心，羞耻心，虚荣心⋯⋯可以说上帝创造人时，他们的心就被赋予里恶念，进而代代相传。 虽然这只是个传说，但传说也并不是凭空捏造的，它完全可以说明人在某时的心理，并且人性之恶是不可抹灭的⋯⋯\n一天，你走在大街上捡到一个钱包时，你首先想到的并不是把钱包如 何交还失主，而是打开看看里面有什么，对自己是否有利。在考虑到 社会舆论的压力，道德观念的谴责和法律法规的制裁的情况下，理性战胜了感性，而没能越过那条警戒线。 在不能说明你无私，反而更说明你心虚，理性只不过是在权威下的屈 服，交还失主也不过是违背自己的真实想法的举动。后来只好用“拾金不味”，“大公无私”等来安慰自己，使自己心理得到平衡。\n虽没有做过恶事，但也有恶念，只不过你在清醒之时，不会轻易表现出来。丧失理智的人，就会做出一些违反常规的事。 回想这些无不说明人的心中存在恶念，恶根，人心便是恶源，人性本恶。\n那如果每个人都性本恶，那世界怎么会这么和谐。 这是因为人出生时，是很弱小的，无法完成独立的生活，便由我们的母亲照顾。在母亲的无微不至的关怀下，让我们体会到母爱的伟大， 母爱的无私，母爱的义务，使我们开始接触到更多的幸福，善良和欢乐。这就注定恶是有弱点的，可以在一定程度上得到压制，那便是爱。\n随着我们年龄的增长，开始为自己的生活奔走时，便会时时闪现出坏 的想法一一恶念，这时我们已有理智能分辨善恶，真假，好坏。这个 理智是由我们从小接触到的爱心，正确的思想教育和强制的法律法规， 迫使我们靠自己的双手努力工作，用辛苦所得维持生活。用理智抚平恶念，才不会出现混沌的世界。 想要生活的更有意义，更幸福，更享受，我们就必须和亲朋合作完成， 因有共同的利益而不至于翻脸，久而久之，便有了友情，爱情。由于共同物质条件而相互联系起来的人群便是社会，这也能适当抑制恶念。 人性本恶，它并不是为人处事的根本，唯有真爱才是为人之道。心常存一份爱心，带着爱去温暖社会，就不会做出恶事，害人害己。\n首先我们要定义什么是善，什么是恶，但善恶本无定论，因为善恶不是对立的，而是互存一体的。\n希腊哲学家分析人性有三种要素：理性、意性、欲性。三者的类别各有特征：理性是合理的、单一的；意性和欲性均为冲动的、非合理的；但意性是单一的，欲性是杂多的。人有理性乃有睿智之徳，便能抑制欲性，决定意性。因之理性似善，欲性似恶，而意性似近于善而远于恶；若理性运用得当，则意性与欲性均可为用，亦可为善。亚里斯多德 亦认为：人性可善可恶，而善恶均起自人生的同一活动；而德与不德，则视其活 动的状态如何？人性本身的善恶虽非均等，而开发恶性与发扬善性的困难却相等。\n总之，人性在某一些部份是善，在别一些部份是恶，二者是兼而有之。 用一种更加简单的话来解释这一个学说的就是，人在出生以后所在的一个环境 下，我们有理性、意性、欲性，这三种性。可是在婴儿期占着主导地位的确是欲性，因为我们在婴儿期所做的一切，无非就是人得本能所应该的事情。而我们在这个时候所养成的一种性格与习惯则是直接影响到人的一生的发展，有的人在这时候的欲性并不强烈有的人反而比其他的还要强烈，而这时所形成各自的性格还有欲望则是不同程度的，所以说理性似善，欲性似恶，而意性似近于善而远于恶；若理性运用得当，则意性与欲性均可为用，亦可为善。\n人类与生俱来是善还是恶，这个问题一直是哲学界争论不休的话题。有些人认为，人类来到这个世界时是一张白纸，而另一些人则认为，人类与生俱来就有自私甚至 “邪恶 ”的倾向。本文将论证人类与生俱来就以自我为中心，甚至是与生俱来的邪恶，而社会、教养和教育对于将个人塑造成富有同情心和同理心的人至关重要。从婴儿以自我为中心的行为到大规模的环境漠视和利益驱动政策，证据表明，如果没有指导，人类往往会为了自身利益而行动，而这往往是以牺牲他人和周围世界为代价的。\n在婴幼儿的行为中，可以看到与生俱来的自私性的一个最直接的例子。刚出生的婴儿会哭闹，要求别人关注他们的需求，几乎没有意识到他人的存在。同样，蹒跚学步的孩子也经常会拿走自己想要的东西，而不考虑其他人的愿望。这些行为虽然在发育过程中是正常的，但却揭示了一个基本事实：幼儿天生以自我为中心，必须教会他们同情、善良和自我克制。父母的干预和社会化引导孩子形成道德指南针。然而，如果不加以引导，这种早期的自我中心可能会演变成更自私、更有害的行为。\n随着儿童的成长，对道德引导的需求会越来越明显。公平、尊重和分享等概念必须由父母、老师和社会灌输。如果没有这些影响，孩子们可能会继续将自己的需求置于他人需求之上，从而做出被社会视为 “坏 ”甚至 “恶 ”的行为。例如，当儿童不顾他人的安危，坚持自己的主导地位或控制权时，就会出现欺凌行为。校园欺凌现象的普遍存在突出表明，如果不加以干预，儿童会自然而然地倾向于有害行为。这表明，人类需要外界的引导来培养亲社会和道德行为。\n在更大的范围内，人类与生俱来的自私在研究环境政策，特别是围绕核能的政策时变得更加清晰。核能是最清洁、最高效的能源之一，其碳排放量远远低于化石燃料。然而，数十年来，美国等国家一直在阻碍核能的发展和采用，其驱动力是对化石燃料行业潜在利润损失的自私恐惧。化石燃料仍然利润丰厚，而转向核能会威胁到石油和天然气公司的既定收入来源。许多政客并不寻求向核能过渡以应对气候变化，而是选择保护化石燃料行业的利润，将经济收益置于环境责任之上。\n此外，美国的政策也阻碍了核废料的有效回收，而回收核废料是可行的，而且已被证明可以大幅减少放射性废料。法国等国家已成功地在其核计划中实施了核废料回收利用，使其核能更具可持续性，对环境的危害更小。然而，在美国，由于化石燃料行业的政治游说，核废料循环利用在某些情况下受到限制或被直接禁止，而化石燃料行业则从维持核能 “浪费 ”的名声中获益。这种拒绝探索更清洁能源途径（如核回收利用）的做法表明，经济利益驱动下的自身利益是如何阻碍基本的环境进步的。在这种情况下，利润优先于可持续发展和公共福利反映了一种更深层次的自私，这种自私本质上可以被视为 “邪恶”。\n围绕核能的恐慌性宣传说明了以自我为中心的动机在起作用的类似模式。尽管核能比煤炭或天然气安全得多，也清洁得多，但有关核能的错误信息却在公众中造成了长期的恐惧。政治家和能源公司经常利用这种恐惧，引导公众远离核能，从而保护利润更高、但对环境有害的行业的利益。这些决定从结构层面揭示了一种内在的自私，因为领导者宁愿利用人们的恐惧来维持利润，也不愿向公众宣传核电的好处。这种短视的做法导致了环境退化，进一步加剧了气候变化，并限制了清洁、可靠能源的获取，表明了为经济利益而牺牲更大利益的意愿。\n政治层面固有私利的另一个例子是，许多国家的政府，尤其是富裕国家的政府，不愿对可再生能源技术进行全面投资。虽然从化石燃料过渡到核能或其他可再生能源需要大量的前期成本，但对人类和地球的长期利益却是巨大的。然而，这些政府往往优先考虑短期经济利益或现有利润结构，而不是做出造福子孙后代的选择。这种不愿意投资核能和其他可持续能源的做法反映了一种潜在的自私心理，即领导人只注重保护自己的经济利益，而不是确保环境的可持续发展和应对气候变化。\n在个人层面，旁观者效应进一步说明了潜在的利己主义倾向。旁观者效应表明，如果他人在场，人们就不太可能帮助处于困境中的人。这种犹豫可能源于避免不便或风险的愿望，表明如果没有强烈的道德信念或社会压力，人们可能会将个人的舒适感置于他人的需求之上。虽然社会已经灌输了促进助人行为的规范，如拨打急救电话或提供帮助，但这些规范的必要性凸显了必须积极抵制的内在自私。\n批评者可能会认为，婴儿以自我为中心的行为只是一种生存本能，而不是与生俱来的自私或邪恶的证据。他们可能会说，婴儿哭喊着要食物或温暖是出于基本需求，而不是道德缺失。然而，生存本能在解释某些行为的同时，也凸显了人类与生俱来的将自己置于他人之上的倾向。社会化对灌输同理心和道德价值观的必要性表明，人类并非天生就具有利他主义或道德善行的驱动力。相反，必须教导他们考虑他人的需要，这突出表明，如果没有道德结构，人们可能会自然而然地倾向于自私的行为。\n总之，从婴儿以自我为中心的行为，到能源政策中短期利益优先于全球环境的利益驱动决策，各种观察结果都支持人类天生自私的论点。从婴儿天生关注自身需求，到避免核开发的政治政策中根深蒂固的利己主义，都清楚地证明了人类的利己主义倾向，这种倾向可能近乎 “邪恶 ”行为。社会规范和道德教诲是人们学会同情和怜悯、重视长期利益而非短期恐惧，以及以服务于共同利益的方式行事所必需的。因此，尽管人类可能并非生来就是恶意的 “邪恶”，但他们与生俱来就有自私自利的本性，如果不加以控制，就会表现出损害他人和整个世界的行为。"},"02_areas/CHINESE/史记":{"title":"史记","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"构成\n本纪（12） 表（10） 书（8） 世家（30）

A different combination of these three primary colors can make all the colors. So, you can represent them in a RGB value, with one slot of how much of each color, usually it ranges from 0-255.

operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and provides a platform for running applications\nIt provides an interface between the user and the hardware in a computer system\nIt hides the complexities of the hardware from the user, for example:\n\nA user does not need to know ‘where’ on secondary storage data is kept, just that it is saved for when they want it again\n\n\nAn operating systems main functions can be divided in to eight key areas\n\nManaging files\na user can create files using application software, the OS allows creation of directories that can store those files within. It also allows users to move files, delete files, name files, and many more.\nProvides an user interface\nA user interface is how the user interacts with the operating system\n\nExamples of user interfaces include:\n\nCommand Line Interface (CLI)\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\nMenu\nNatural language (NLI)\nCommand Line Interface and Graphical User Interface\nWhat is a menu interface?\n\n\nA menu interface is successive menus presented to a user with a single option at each stage\nOften performed with buttons or a keypad\nExamples include\n\nChip and pin machines\nVending machines\nEntertainment streaming services\nWhat is a natural language interface?\n\n\nA natural language interface (NLI) uses the spoken word to respond to spoken or textual inputs from a user\nExamples include\n\nVirtual assistants - Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri\nSearch engines\nSmart home devices\n\n\n\nHandles Interrupts\nAn interrupt\na signal sent to the processor to tell it something needs its attention\n\nInterrupt events require the immediate attention of the central processing unit\nIn order to maintain the smooth running of the system, interrupts need to be handled and processed in a timely manner\nFor example, if a user clicks cancel on a file conversion process, a signal is sent from the mouse, interrupts the processor, and the operating system will trigger the cancellation routine\n\nis a signal sent from a device or from software to the microprocessor. This will cause the microprocessor to temporarily stop what it is doing so that it can service the interrupt.\nInterrupts can be caused by\n\nhardware fault\ninput/output process, ex. requires more inputs to continue\nsoftware errors\ntwo processes attempting to access the same memory locations\ndata input, ex. key pressed or mouse click\nInterrupts allow computers to carry out many tasks or to have several windows open at the same time.\n\nManaging peripherals and devices\na computer cannot be used without input and output devices, peripherals. A driver is a software that the translates data from the computer to the peripheral and vice versa.\n\nThe OS allocates system resources to peripherals to ensure efficient operation\nPeripheral management makes plug-and-play (PnP) functionality possible, automatically detecting and configuring new peripherals without the need for manually installing device drivers or power cycling the system\n\nWhat is a device driver?\n\nA device driver is a piece of software used to control a piece of hardware\nPeripherals require device drivers in order to be used by the operating system\nThe OS has generic device drivers built in which makes basic compatibility possible and enables plug-and-play (PnP)\nIn order for hardware to be used to its maximum capacity, often a separate device driver must be downloaded from the manufacturer\nDevice drivers are OS specific and are regularly updated\n\nManaging user accounts\nthis can include preferences, keep data separate for multiple accounts, and restricting access.\nProviding System Security\n\nOperating systems provide various security features such as password-protected system accounts, a firewall, virus scanning and file encryption\nPassword-protected system accounts are a very common feature in operating systems\nSystem accounts can also be restricted from performing certain actions, e.g. editing network settings, installing unapproved software, changing the account settings of other users\n\nMulti tasking and Memory management\nA single processor can only ever execute one instruction at a time. The processor does this so fast that it appears to be doing several tasks at once. The OS allows this to happen by deciding which processes should be executed next and how long they can spend being processed before switching to another process, using interrupts.\n\nMemory management is a process carried out by the operating system allocating main memory (RAM) between different programs that are open at the same time\nThe OS is responsible for copying programs and data from secondary to primary storage as it is needed\nPrograms and data require different amounts of RAM to operate efficiently and the OS manages this process\nRAM is allocated based on priority and fairness, for example, system applications (essential) may have a higher priority than user applications\nThe OS dynamically manages the memory, adjusting allocation as needed to maintain optimal system performance\nMemory management makes multitasking possible\n\nProvide a platform for applications to run\n\nOperating systems provide a platform on which application software can run, this is mainly by allowing software access to system resources\nFor example, if a computer game has intensive graphics and online play, the operating system will grant it access to the GPU and the network card\n\n\nOperating Systems\nprovides an interface, manages files, manages peripherals and drivers, manages memory, manages multitasking, manages interrupts, provides a platform for running applications, manages user accounts\nsystem software\nan operating system allows the computer system to function correctly and allow users to communicate with the computer system. Applications can run and interaction between humans and computers.\ninterfaces GUI and CLI\nWIMP: windows, icons, menus, and pointers\nFirmware. when a computer starts up, part of the operating system needs to be loaded into RAM, this is known as booting up the computer.\nThe start-up of the computer’s motherboard is handled by the basic input/output system, BIOS. The BIOS tells the computer where the storage device that holds the operating system can be found, then it loads the part of the operating system that is needed and executes it. The BIOS is an example of a firmware.\nFirmware is defined as a program that provides low level control for devices.\nBuffers are memory areas that stores data temporarily.\nRecall\nCLI stands for command line interface, it requires users to enter specific instructions using only the keyboard, the entry level for using this interface is quite high, its benefits are that it takes less resources than GUIs and are better for certain situations.\nGUI stands for graphical user interface, the user can click on or operate using graphics , it is very easy to use.\ntask 1\nAn operating system is software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer system. It handles peripheral devices, files, and provides an interface.\ntask 2\nAn interrupt is a signal that tells the microprocessor to temporarily stop what it is doing. This allows computers to carry out many task or to have several windows.\nInterrupts can be caused by\n\ntwo processes attempting to access the same memory locations\nprograms requesting for input\noutput required for the software to continue\nerror from the hardware\n\ntask 3\nA buffer is a memory storing area that stores data temporarily to have data to be passed in and out quickly to allow multiple processes to be serviced.\nplenary\nFirmware is a program that provides low level control for devices.\nFirmware is often used to start up a device.\nThe BIOS, basic input/output system, is an example of firmware.\nSome examples of system software are operating systems and  device drivers\nReview learning\nwww\nunderstood the importance of operating systems and how they use interrupts\nebi\nlearn more about firmware"},"02_areas/COMP-SCIENCE/4/Programming-Languages":{"title":"Programming Languages","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A programming language acts as a bridge between what humans understand and what a computer understands\nPrograms are sets of instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks.\nPrograms can be written in high-level or low-level languages, according to the requirements of the user.\nHigh-Level languages ⇒ Assembly languages ⇒ Machine code ⇒ Binary code → to computer machine\n\n\nA high-level programming language uses English-like statements to allow users to program with easy to use code\n\n\nHigh-level languages allow for clear debugging and once programs are created they are easier to maintain\n\n\nHigh level languages were needed due to the development of processor speeds and the increase in memory capacity\n\n\nOne instruction translates into many machine code instructions\n\n\nNeeds to be translated into machine code for the computer to be able to execute it\nHigh level languages enable a programmer to write programs for a computer without knowledge of the hardware and instruction sets of that computer.\nSame programming concepts can be applied to different high-level languages.\nThey are considered portable, you can write the program on one computer, and run it on a different computer.\n\n\nA low-level language is a programming language that directly translates to machine code understood by the processor\n\n\nLow-level languages allow direct control over hardware components such as memory and registers\n\n\nThese languages are written for specific processors to ensure they embed the correct machine architecture\nLow level languages are related to the hardware architecture and its instruction set.

Gambling, alcohol, drugs, sugary foods/drinks- They are over-provided in a market and their consumption often creates external costs    - Governments often have to regulate these goods in such a way that they raise the prices and/or limit the quantities consumedMerit Goods- These are goods that are beneficial to society but consumers under-consume them as they do not fully recognise the private or external benefits    - E.g. Vaccinations, education, electric cars- They are under-provided in a market and their consumption generates both private and/or external benefits    - Governments often have to subsidise these goods in order to lower the price and/or increase the quantities consumedPublic Goods- Public goods are beneficial to society but would be under-provided by a free market as there is little opportunity for sellers to make profits from providing these goods/services as they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption    - Good examples include national defence, parks, libraries and lighthouses- Non-excludability refers to the inability of private firms to exclude certain customers from using their products. In effect, the price mechanism cannot be used to exclude customers e.g. street lighting    - Non-rivalry refers to the inability of the product to be used up, so there is no competitive rivalry in consumption to drive up prices and generate profits for firms    - Therefore, governments will often provide these beneficial goods themselves, and so they are called public goodsAbuse of Monopoly Power- The development of monopolymarkets is a natural outcome of a market system    - Firms seek to eliminate competition by buying out competitors and increasing their ownership of factors of production    - With less competition, firms can raise prices, reduce the choice available to consumers, or limit the supply- The outcome is that goods/services are purposely under-providedin order to raise prices and profits    - Governments often intervene to ensure that there is healthy competition in markets and sufficient provision of goods/servicesFactor Immobility- Factor immobility occurs when it is difficult for factors of productionto move or switch between different uses/locations    - The two main types of factor immobility are the geographicaland occupational immobility of labour- Factor immobility results an inefficient allocation of resources in a market (usually under-provision)    - Governments often implement programs to reduce the factor immobility in order to raise production and outputExternal Costs and Benefits- Externalities occur when there is an external cost or benefit on a third party not involved in the economic transaction    - These impacts can be positive or negative    - The price mechanism in a free market ignores these externalities    - If these external costs/benefits were acknowledged, then the price and output in the market would be different- A positive externality of consumption occurs when there is a positive external benefit in consumption, such as when electric vehicles are consumed CO2 emissions fall    - A positive externality of production occurs when there is a positive external benefit in production, such as when managed pine forests produce timber but also increase CO2absorption    - A negative externality of consumption occurs when there is an external cost in consumption such as when the consumption of alcohol increases anti social behaviour    - A negative externality of production occurs when there is an external cost in production such as when the production of electricity increases air pollution"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/14/Market-Failure-Defined":{"title":"Market Failure

store it or export it)     - When used in demerit markets**, output falls** (Governments will not purchase the excess supply of a demerit good)     - Producers usually lower their output in the market to match the QD at the minimum price &amp;

not just the elite- Distorts the allocation of resourcesin markets e.g. it often results in excess supply when used in agricultural markets    - There is an opportunity costassociated with the government expenditure - could the money have been better used elsewhere?    - Subsidies are prone to political pressure &amp;

are not provided by private firms due to the free rider problem    - Examples include roads, parks, lighthouses, national defence- They are usually provided free at the point of consumption    - Accessible to everyone regardless of income    - Usually provide both private &amp; external benefitsto society- Paid for through general taxation    - There is an opportunity cost associated with their provision    - Products which are free may result in excess demand &amp; long waiting times e.g. procedures at Public hospitalsPrivatisation- Privatisation occurs when governments transfer ownership &amp; control of firms/assets from the State (public sector) to the private sector (private firms)    - Many State firms are monopolies. By privatising them it encourages more competition in those markets    - This should result in more efficiency &amp; lower prices for consumers- Increases government revenue in the year the asset is sold    - Private firms may run the business more efficiently    - The government no longer needs to manage the business or hire people to work for it - this reduces government expenditure- Government assets are often sold well below their actual market value    - Private firms often provide a sub standard good/service as they cut quality to increase profits    - The price of the good/service usually increases as firms seek to maximise their profit e.g. energy prices in the UK market    - Many privatised companies still maintain considerable market power &amp; have to be regulated, e.g. water companiesNationalisation- Nationalisation occurs when the Government takes control &amp; ownership of firms which were in the private sector- This can generate efficiencies, especially when delivering utilities(gas, water, electricity) to the national population    - It creates more equity in societyas all citizens have the same access to the same resource at the same price e.g. Norway nationalised much of the oil industry when oil was first discovered in 1972. The profits belong to the citizens    - The business can generate significant revenue for government- Government firms can often run very inefficiently    - There is an opportunity costassociated with the money required to run it    - The Government may lack the expertise to run the businessRegulation- Governments create rules to limit harm from the external costs of consumption/production    - They often create regulatory agencies to monitor that the rules are not broken- Individuals or firms may be fined/imprisonedfor breaking the rules e.g. selling cigarettes to minors is a punishable offence    - They help to reduce the external costs of demerit goods    - Fines can generate extra government revenue- Enforcing laws requires the government to hire more peopleto work for the regulatory agencies    - Enforcing laws can be difficult as it is a complex process to determine if firms/consumersare breaking the laws    - The regulation may create underground (illegal) marketswhich could generate even higher external costs on society\n\nThe government\n\ntake into account all the costs and benefits ex. maintain a railway line\nencourage consumption of products that are beneficial ex. subsidies for something that is more beneficial to consumers and others more than they realize\ncares about the externalities\ndiscourage consumption of harmful products ex. taxes, awareness, legislation\nprevent private sector firms from exploiting consumers\nmake the maximum use of resources ex. ensuring that those who are willing are able to find work\nplan head\nhelp vulnerable groups ex. ensure they have access to basic necessities, create a more even distribution of income by taxing the rich at a high rate, progressive taxation.\n\nfree market\nentrepreneurs able to make profit\nfreedom to set up business\nprices determined by market forces\nprivate ownership of businesses\ngovernment intervention\nprogressive taxation\ngovernment regulations\ntaxes on demerit goods\ngov provision of public goods"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/15/Privatization-and-Nationalization":{"title":"Privatization and Nationalization","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Privatization\nrefers to the transfer of ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector.\ngovernments might do this to wind down its interest in public utilities and invest government budget into something else.\nAdvantages\n\nearn one-off privatization proceeds from the sale\nreduce government debt\n\ndoes not need to maintain\nearns revenue from the sale\npays corporate taxes\n\n\nreduces costs to taxpayers\nprivate sector businesses have the incentive to improve efficiency\n\nDisadvantages\n\ncreates a private sector monopolist, consumers may face higher prices\nmay still require government regulation and intervention\nthere is opportunity cost as the state-owned enterprise can provide social benefits\n\nBAIL-OUT\npaying a private sector’s institution’s debts to take over and protect jobs and stuff\n⇒ nationalized\nNationalization\nthis is buying private assets and putting them under the wing of the government. this corrects market failures and inefficiencies\nthis can protect employment and promote economic stability in key industries.\nthere is a large opportunity cost though"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/15/econproject":{"title":"econproject","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nwww.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/03/bike-share-oversupply-in-china-huge-piles-of-abandoned-and-broken-bicycles/556268/\nsome pictures here\nBike-Sharing\nMarket Failure Type:\nAs you walk along the sidewalks in Chinese cities, you can see that almost all public bike parking spaces have bike-sharing companies’ bikes parked in them. Before, when bike-sharing was popular,  you can see fleets of parked bikes on public sidewalks, showing their product and service to all pedestrians walking by and luring them to use them. Later on, this became a problem, because bikes were occupying too much space on sidewalks and. caused blockages and injuries. This overuse and exploitation of public spaces for private profit in terms of customer outreach and inventory space is called tragedy of the commons.\nThe blockage and obstruction of sidewalks is also a negative externality. ‘Pollution’ on the sidewalks made the walking space too narrow, slowing and limiting foot traffic and can cause injuries.\nDuring the height of the bike-sharing popularity, Ofo and Mobike quickly captured 80% of the market share, leading to a monopoly. This monopoly led to smaller companies not being able to compete. They try to compete, manufacturing and shipping out their own bikes, but don’t have the same user-base or cheapness of the two monopolies, leading to their bikes not being used, leading to the bikes being thrown away. This is another negative externality, the waste from unused bikes is very high and damages the environment. The oversupply of 40+ dockless (No designated or designed parking docks) contributed to steel and aluminum waste, 1.5m tons. The solid tires and digital locks also makes recycling costly, 35kg of CO2 per bike.\nEvidence:\nOversupply of 40+ dockless companies led to waste\n3,000+ bikes dumped in rivers\nSolid tires and digital locks makes recycling costly (35kg of CO2 per bike).\nbikes cause steel/aluminum waste (1.5M tons).\nBikes are just left on public sidewalks when no one uses them, taking up common space.\nmore evidence and photos\nKey Stakeholders:\nHarmed:\n\nPedestrians → Trip hazards from sidewalk clutter\nLocal governments → $500/month per worker cleanup costs\nEcosystems → Metal waste from non-recyclable frames.\n\nBenefited:\n\nFirms (Ofo, Mobike) → Captured 80% market share\nUsers → 1 RMB/ride subsidies.\n\nSolution 1: Cap bike amount + geofenced parking\nPrevent illegal parking of bikes with geolocation services in the bikes.\nPros:\n\nReduces oversupply\nallocative efficiency via GPS tracking.\ndetects bad parking, discourages users from doing so\nCons:\nHigh enforcement costs ($2M/year in Beijing)\nmay limit accessibility in low-density areas.\n\nSolution 2: Pigovian tax\nPros:\n\nbike monthly taxes could fund recycling (offsetting 35kg CO2 per bike)\nReduces negative externalities\nif they were forced to pay a tax, it could not only help offset the negative externalities but discourage the factory from oversupplying so much in the first place.\nCons:\nPigovian taxes are difficult to calculate properly\nImposing the wrong tax would be inefficient and costly, and discouraging the use of scooters and bike sharing programs\nCan hit low-income consumers hardest\n\nResponsibility:\nWe believe that the companies, like Ofo and Mobike, should be responsible because of their profit-driven overproduction. Over 40 firms flooded cities with their bikes to use the public resource of sidewalks for free advertising and outreach to customers, creating at least 95% of externality costs.\n\nE-Scooters\nMarket Failure Type:\nThe illegal and unregulated parking of e-scooters leads to safety risks and sidewalk congestion. At one point, 60% of Shanghai’s sidewalks were obstructed by scooters. Some e-scooters were also left in emergency entrances in apartment complexes, blocking crucial passages. E-scooters also led to people being able to travel at high speeds, this was seen with delivery riders. Some went 32km/h vs. the 8km/h pedestrian speed on sidewalks, posing a huge safety risk. Oversupplied e-scooters also created lots of battery waste, harming the soil because of lithium leakage. These are all negative externalities of unregulated use of e-scooters. This unregulated use is because of information asymmetry, users were unaware of the correct parking rules, and there weren’t designated parking spots for them to park their scooters. There might also be a. lack of bike/scooter lanes, forcing them to weave between pedestrians.\nEvidence:\nnormal users speeding or delivery riders speeding on sidewalks (32km/h vs. 8km/h pedestrian speed)\n60% of Shanghai sidewalks were obstructed by scooters\nlack of bike lanes in some places\nE-scooters create battery waste (lithium leakage harms soil)\nScooters could pile up near apartment buildings without proper parking spaces for them, blocking everyday travel for other residents.\nScooters could be parked in stairwells or emergency access entrances, blocking off crucial entrances and pathways.\nmore evidence and pictures\nKey Stakeholders:\nHarmed:\nPedestrians → Injury risks:15% increase in ER visits in Shanghai 2022\nGovernments → 4M/year for scooter dump yard cleanups.\nBenefited:\nCompanies → delivery companies have high revenue and users because of ease and speed\nUsers → 15-minute (now longer) delivery guarantee\nSolution 1: AI-monitored geofenced slow zones with penalties if broken\nPros:\n\nreduces accidents\npreserves accessibility\nCons:\nmonitoring costs\nrequires good internet and cell service infrastructure\n\nSolution 2: Mandatory insurance for firms\nPros:\n\nCovers national healthcare costs from accidents\nthe ‘polluter’ pays\nCons:\nCould raise user fees\ncomplex insurance claims process\n\nResponsibility:\nGovernment (70%) and delivery companies (30%).\nLack of bike lanes (only 12% of Shanghai roads have them) forced scooters onto sidewalks, but delivery firms incentivized reckless riding via punitive delivery targets. Users might not be aware of parking rules or why with their driving skills they shouldn’t speed, so governments should also raise awareness.\n\nConclusion\nBefore this project, we only saw two types of shared-bikes on the sidewalks, blue ones and yellow ones. It turns out it is this way because they dominate the market, and it is not like smaller companies didn’t try to compete in this market. In fact they do, but they can’t profit with these two big firms, leading to their production of bicycles go to waste. Hundred of thousands maybe even millions of wasted bikes that were competing in this market are now discarded in graveyards because they fought for dominance and use of free customer outreach using public sidewalks. Though this project we learned how much negative externalities e-scooters and shared bike programs caused and the magnitude of this problem when no regulations were placed."},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/15/externalities":{"title":"externalities","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Positive\nbenefits that spill over to third parties\nex. education leading to a more productive society\nNegative\ncosts that spill over to third parties\nex. pollution from a factory affecting nearby residents."},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/15/merit-and-demerit-goods":{"title":"merit and demerit goods","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Merit\nthese are goods that are deemed beneficial for individuals and society, but are often under-consumed if left to the free market.\nex. education, helathcare\nDemerit\ngoods that are considered harmful, but may be over-consumed in a free market\nex. tobacco and alcohol"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/15/public-goods":{"title":"public goods","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"These are goods that are non-excludable, you can’t prevent people from using them\nand\nnon-rivalrous, one person’s use doesn’t reduce the availability for others.\nex. street lighting and national defense\nbecause no one can be excluded from using them, private firms won’t supply them"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/5/macroeconomics":{"title":"macroeconomics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Macroeconomics \n                  \n                \n\nthe study of the whole economy\n\n\nattempts to explain what is likely to happen if there is an economic change."},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/5/microeconomics-and-macroeconomics":{"title":"microeconomics and macroeconomics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Some of the Differences Between Micro- and Macroeconomics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroeconomicsMacroeconomicsSingle market e.g. milkEntire economy e.g. singaporePrice of a good/serviceAverage price levels in an economy (inflation/deflation)Individual/market demandTotal demand in an economyIndividual firm/market supplyTotal supply in an economyGovernment intervention in a market e.g. cigarettesGovernment intervention in the economy e.g. income taxReasons for differences in workers wagesUnemployment and minimum wages\n\nMicroeconomics is the study of individual markets and sections of the economy, rather than the economy as a whole\n\nIt examines the different choices individuals, households and firms\nIt examines what factors influence their choices\nIt examines how their decisions affect the price, demand and supply of goods/services in a market\nIt examines how Governments influence consumption and production \n\n\nMacroeconomics is the study of economic behavior and decision making in the entire economy, rather than just an individual market\n\nIt examines the role of the government in achieving economic growth and human development through the implementation of specific government policies (fiscal, monetary and supply-side)\nIt examines the role of the government in achieving price stability, low unemployment and a stable Current Account balance on the Balance of Payments account\nIt examines the interaction of the economy with the rest of the world through international trade\n\n\n"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/5/microeconomics":{"title":"microeconomics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  microeconomics \n                  \n                \n\nstudy of the behavior and decisions of particular markets (households and firms) and the performance of individual markets.\n\n\nlike theory\nmarket - an arrangement which brings buyers into contact with sellers.\nincludes topics such as changes in the earnings in a particular occupation and changes in the output in the car industry"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/6/00_Free-Market-Project":{"title":"00_Free Market Project","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Art of the Free Market: Interpreting Price Mechanism and Resource Allocation\nSummary\n200 words\nOur artwork illustrates the dynamics of the free market through three distinct scenes of an ice cream vendor and ice cream customers adjusting their demand and supply based on changes in price. The traffic light symbolizes price signals, with green being increase price, yellow being no change, and red being decrease price. We all came up with this idea, the crafting was mainly done by Dora and Carolyn, assisted by Billy, the script and summary was written by Brooklyn and Henry. We made three distinct scenarios of ice cream sales to show the market dynamics. In the first scene, the traffic light is green, so customers cross the road and are able to come and buy ice cream, illustrating high demand, which prompts the vendor to raise prices. This scene shows how price can rise when there is limited supply with high demand. The second scene presents an equilibrium state, where the price of the ice cream matches demand perfectly, This balance ensures both customer satisfaction and vendor profitability. Finally, the third scene addresses a scenario where the traffic light is red and customers are not able to come and buy ice cream, illustrating low demand, which prompts the vendor to lower prices to attract more customers and get rid of excess supply. Together these scenes show the art of the free market where price mechanism and resource allocation work together to balance supply and demand.\nHigh Demand\nIn this scenario, the traffic light turns green and in comes a lot of customers, the demand for ice cream exceeds the available supply. The vendor looks at the traffic light and increases the price because it is green. This manages the high demand, the higher prices will decrease demand, ensuring that the limited supply reaches customers who value it most.\ncard\nAs the light turns green, customers are able to come and buy ice cream, creating high demand. The vendor increases the price because the light is green, managing the overwhelming amount of customers with the limited supply.\nEquilibrium\nHere, there are less people because the light is yellow, the price of ice cream aligns with the demand, creating a stable market. The vendor doesn’t change the price and sells just the right amount of ice cream to meet consumer demand without any excess supply. This is called equilibrium, and it is ideal for both the vendor and customers, satisfying both sides.\ncard\nThe price and demand are perfectly balanced, allowing the vendor to meet\ncustomer needs while maintaining a steady supply.\nLow Demand\nIn this final scenario, the traffic light is red, stopping customers from being able to come, the demand for ice cream is too low, resulting in excess supply. To stimulate sales, the vendor lowers the prices. This attracts more customers and clear out surplus inventory because the price is lower.\ncard\nWith excess ice cream and insufficient customers, the vendor lowers prices to entice buyers and reduce surplus.\nSupply and demand Jenga\ninteractive Jenga tower will visually represent the balance between supply and demand din a free market.\nreal life -

producers make more blocks and places them\nrising demand - remove from bottom - increased production, put blocks bottom fill in empty space first, to make more (the removal from bottom then putting blocks top represents firms meeting demand so equal supply/adding and demand/removal) - too tall tower more easily to knock down (think: earthquakes and stuff)\nfalling demand - remove less blocks - supply decreases, so firms don’t produce and don’t place blocks in the empty spaces where the blocks were removed. when too many empty spaces on bottom, it risk destabilizing/falling\nadjustment to equilibrium - as blocks are changed, the tower become unstable, the goal is to remove/add blocks while keeping the tower balanced, showing how the free market naturally moves towards equilibrium over time.\npractical procedure of removing and adding blocks\n3 part cycle\n//multiple of 3 probably works better, test dif amounts out for optimal visuals/easier presentation\ndemand high = remove 6 blocks at a time\nproduction high = add &gt;6 each time (decide later)\nless demand = remove 3 blocks at a time\nless production = add 2 blocks each time (2 or 1, decide later, prob 2)\nstart of Jenga game: low tower = supply low → demand high → price high\ntherefore leads to more production\ntower becomes higher → more and more unstable cuz taller\nthen as production and prices increase, demand decreases\ntherefore less production, price decrease\ntower base still gets filled but each time at least one empty space remains, so to remove 3 blocks, 2 blocks from base removed + 1 block from next layer has to be removed, so spaces all the way to the top of the tower if this section cycles, leading to less stable cuz gaps in tower.\nprice decrease because excess supply (shown by the tower layers that do not have gaps in them), so demand increases again\ntherefore supply low → cycle again but closer to equilibrium each time\nonce all available full layered blocks are removed by one each layer, remove from top → tower gets shorter → shorter tower → less supply"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/6/Market-Economic-System-bad":{"title":"Market Economic System bad","links":["02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/6/Market-System","02_areas/ECON/01The-Basic-Economic-Problem/2/Enterprise","02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/7/Demand","02_areas/ECON/01The-Basic-Economic-Problem/2/Land","02_areas/ECON/01The-Basic-Economic-Problem/2/Capital","02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/6/Price-Mechanism"],"tags":[],"content":"Market System\nfree Enterprise economy\nconsumers determine what is produced, their Demand\nLand and Capital are privately owned\nresources are allocated by Price Mechanism\nthere is no such thing as total market economic system"},"02_areas/ECON/02The-Allocation-of-Resources/6/Market-Failure-Defined-prev":{"title":"Market Failure Defined prev","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nFree markets often work very well \nHowever, there is sometimes a less than optimum allocation of resources from the point of view of society. This is called Market Failure\n\nSometimes there is an over-provision of goods/services which are harmful (demerit goods) and therefore an over-allocation of the resources (factors of production) used to make these goods/services e.g. cigarettes \nSometimes there is an under-provision of the goods/services which are beneficial (public goods and merit goods) and therefore an under-allocation of the resources (factors of production) used to make these goods/services e.g. schools\nSometimes the market causes a lack of equity (inequality) -

There is easy and immediate access to money in this type of account, but usually interest is not paid on money held in such an account. Customers use current accounts mainly to receive and make payments\nThe other type of account is a deposit or time account, a period of notice has to be given before money can be withdrawn from this account. Interest is paid on any money held in a deposit account and customers use deposit accounts as a way of saving.\n\n\nlend money\n\nthere are two main ways of borrowing money from a bank, one is in the form of an overdraft, this enables a customer to spend more than what is in her or his account, up to an agreed limit. Interest is charged on the amount borrowed. This can be relatively expensive way of borrowing and is mainly used to cover short-term gaps between expenses and income.\nThe other way of borrowing is by taking a loan. This is usually for a particular purpose and for a particular period of time, interest is charged on the full amount of the loan but the rate of interest is likely to be lower than that on an overdraft.\nA customer may be asked to provide some form of security, known as collateral, when taking a loan. This is to ensure that if the loan is not repaid, the assets given as collateral can be sold and the money recovered.\nIn practice, banks tend to try and not do this by checking very carefully whether the person seeking a loan will be able to repay it. In the case of a firm, this is likely to involve a scrutiny of the firm’s accounts and business plan.\n\n\nenable customers to make payments\n\nreceive and make payments, acting as agents for payments and providing money transmission services, like credit cards, direct debits, debit cards, and online banking\n\n\nother functions\n\nexchange foreign currency\nleave important documents\nlock boxes\nadministration of wills\nfinancial matters ex. tax forms, purchase and sales of shares.\nthe first two functions are essentially the bank acting as financial intermediaries.

Another aim which can conflict with this key aim is what is known as liquidity. Banks have to ensure that they can meet with their customer’s requests to withdraw money. So, they have to keep a certain amount of what are called liquid assets, which can be turned into cash quickly and without incurring loss.\n\nCentral Banks\n\n\n                  \n                   A Central Bank\n                  \n                \n\nis the single most important and influential bank in the country or region.\n\n\nex.

and vice versa- Social trends include any major changes within society and can influence the supply of labour to certain industries e.g. work from home during Covid resulted in significant changes to the labour market and not all workers returned to work when economies opened up again\nDiagrammatic Analysis of the Labour Market\n\n\nThe labour market is a type of factor market  \n\n\nFactor markets follow exactly the same rules as product markets\n\n\nThey are affected by changes to price, demand and supply\n\n\nThey are affected by the price elasticity of demand and supply.   \n\n\n\n\nLabour market equilibrium occurs where the demand for labour (DL) is equal to the supply of labour (SL)\n\n\nThe DL is the demand by firms for workers - firms demand more labour as the wage rate decreases which results in a downward sloping demand curve\n\n\nThe SL is the supply of labour by workers - workers supply more labour as the wage rate increases which results in an upward sloping supply curve\n\n\n\n\nIndividual firms are price takers in the labour market as they have to accept the wage rate that workers are being paid in the industry\n\n\nIf they offer a lower wage, they will likely struggle to recruit workers\n\n\nIf they offer a higher wage there will be a large number of workers applying to work there\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the labour market for graphic designers, the equilibrium wage rate is W and the equilibrium quantity is Q. At this point the DL = SL\nDiagram analysis\n\n\nThe market for graphic designers is in equilibrium where D****L = S****L \n\n\nThe equilibrium wage is W and the quantity of labour is Q\n\n\nThere is no excess supply of labour\n\n\nThere is no excess demand for labour\n\n\nAnalysing the PED and PES of Labour\n  Price inelastic demand and supply\n\n\nConsider the labour market for NBA basketball players\n\n\nIn 2022, LeBron James received a salary of $45m\n\n\n\nWage determination in highly skilled markets is price inelastic in both supply and demand\n   Diagram analysis\n\n\nD****L is the demand for labour from the basketball clubs\n\n\nS****L is the supply of labour by the basketball players\n\n\nThe demand for highly skilled players is very price inelastic\n\nClubs want the very best players, almost irrespective of what they cost\n\n\n\nThe supply of highly skilled players is also very price inelastic \n\nA significant increase in price will have little impact on the quantity of labour supplied in the market as it takes years to develop LeBron James type skills\n\n\n\nThe market equilibrium is found at W1Q1 - a high price and relatively low quantity  \n\n\nPrice elastic demand and supply   \n\nConsider the labour market for labourers on a building site\n \n\n\nDiagram analysis\n\n\nD****L is the demand for labour from the building company for labourers\n\n\nS****L is the supply of labour by people willing to work on a building site\n\n\nThe demand for workers is very price elastic\n\nIf wages dropped a little, then firms would respond quickly by employing more workers\n\n\n\nThe supply of workers is also very price elastic \n\nDue to it being an unskilled job, there would quickly be an increase in the supply of labour if wages were to increase\n\n\n\nThe market equilibrium is found at W1Q1 - a low price and relatively high quantity\n\n\nRelative Bargaining Power\n\n\nWorkers have different degrees of bargaining power when it comes to negotiating wage increases with their employers\n\n\nThe following factors influence their bargaining power\n\n\n\n\nMembership of a trade union: trade unions represent the interests of the workers in negotiations with employers and members frequently enjoy higher wages than non-union members \n\n\nAge and experience: young, inexperienced workers have less bargaining power then older, more experienced workers. As workers grow older their age often begins to count against them and this reduces bargaining power\n\n\nLevel of education: education provides higher levels of skill and specialisation to a worker. This increases their bargaining power relative to unskilled workers\n\n\nCurrent supply conditions: the supply of labour in many industries can change due to socio-political conditions e.g prior to Brexit, workers in the hotel industry had very little bargaining power. Brexit created a shortage of labour willing to work in hotels and so the bargaining power of workers has increased, resulting in higher wages in the industry\n\n\nGovernment Policy: Minimum Wages\n\n\nGovernment’s often intervene in the labour market by setting a minimum wage\n\nThey do this in order to improve equity and avoid the exploitation of worker\n\n\n\nA minimum wage is a legally imposed wage level that employers must pay their workers\n\n\nIt is set above the market rate\n\n\nThe minimum wage/hour often varies based on age\n\n\n\n\n\nA national minimum wage (NMW1) is imposed above the market wage rate (We) at W1\nDiagram analysis\n\n\nThe market equilibrium wage and quantity for truck drivers in the UK is seen at WeQ****e\n\n\nThe government imposes a national minimum wage (NMW) at W****1\n\n\nIncentivised by higher wages, the supply of labour increases from Qe to Qs\n\n\nFacing higher production costs, the demand for labour by firms decreases from Qe to Qd\n\n\nThis means that at a wage rate of W****1 there is excess supply of labour and the potential for unemployment equal to QdQ****s\n\n"},"02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/18/Wage-Factors":{"title":"Wage Factors","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\nThe occupational choices of workers are influenced by a range of wage and non-wage factors, which are often held in balance when making decisions about where to work\n\n\nWage factors are financial payments that workers receive for their labour\n\n\nNon-wage factors incorporate a range of influences that are meaningful to a worker\n   \n\n\nA Summary of Wage Factors That Influence Occupational Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactorExplanationWages- An agreed amount of money/hour and is calculated directly from the number of hours worked    - E.g.

Workers doing exactly the same job may receive different compensation based on different outcomes they achieveShare options- Payment through the issuing of shares in the company the employee works for    -

Reports from early 2025 indicate continued legal battles and solidarity actions, with no clear resolution. This has involved multiple unions blocking services like license plate deliveries, putting pressure on Tesla to sign a collective bargaining agreement, but this did not affect Tesla much. Both sides, being both big, are unwilling to budge.\nUnited States:\nIn the US, Tesla has successfully resisted unionization efforts, still with no unions representing its workers as of now. Despite attempts by the United Auto Workers (UAW) and others since 2017, and ongoing investigations into labor practices, Tesla remains the only major American automaker without union representation.\nElon Musk, as co-chair of DOGE under President Trump, has been involved in significant government reforms, posing a threat on the government branches that chooses to go against him,  rendering the weak labor laws even more weak as most investigations and oversight have ended.\n\nStrength of the Trade Unions\nThe strength of the trade unions varied significantly between the two countries.\n\n\nSweden: The union, primarily IF Metall, appears strong due to several factors:\n\nHigh union density, with almost 90% of the Swedish workforce covered by collective agreements\nSolidarity actions from multiple unions, including dockworkers refusing to unload Tesla vehicles and international support, creating a broad blockade.\nGovernment support, such as banning replacement workers, enhancing union leverage.\nThe strike’s persistence into 2025, despite Tesla’s legal challenges, indicates resilience, with IF Metall vowing to continue.\n\n\n\nUSA: The union efforts, led by UAW, seem weaker:\n\nLower union density in the auto industry, especially for EVs, with Tesla being the only major non-union American automaker.\nTesla’s aggressive anti-union tactics, including firings and legal battles, with historical violations noted, such as a 2019 ruling by an administrative judge on illegal union-busting\nWeaker labor laws, with solidarity actions like those in Sweden being illegal in the USA, limiting union power.\n\n\n\nKey Players\npostal workers, blocking services such as license plate deliveries and waste collection.\n\n\nSweden:\n\nTrade Union: IF Metall, leading the strike, with support from 12 other unions.\nEmployers: Tesla, refusing to sign agreements, with CEO Elon Musk publicly opposing unions.\nEmployees: Mechanics and other workers, with over 30 on strike nationwide by July 2024, showing active participation.\nGovernment: Supportive, banning replacement workers and upholding labor rights\nSociety: High public support, with 90% workforce unionized\n\n\n\nUSA:\n\nTrade Union: UAW, attempting to organize, with Tesla Workers United filing complaints.\nEmployers: Tesla, resisting unionization, with firings and legal defenses.\nEmployees: Workers at Buffalo, facing retaliation, with over 30 fired in 2023.\nGovernment: NLRB involved, with mixed outcomes, finding some violations but dismissing others\nSociety: Less supportive, with lower union density and legal constraints on solidarity actions.\n\n\n\nIndustrial Actions\nThe industrial actions taken highlight the strategies employed:\n\n\nSweden:\n\nStrikes by mechanics, starting October 2023, expanding to over 30 strikers by July 2024.\nSolidarity blockades, with dockworkers refusing to unload vehicles, electricians and cleaners joining, as in Musk and Tesla are battling unions across Scandinavia.

The struggles manifested differently in each country, reflecting varying labor laws, union strength, and employer responses.\n\n\nSweden: The conflict began in October 2023 when mechanics affiliated with IF Metall, the Swedish metalworkers’ union, went on strike, demanding Tesla sign a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nTesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, refused to negotiate, stating in an X post that unions “create negativity” and a “lords and peasants situation” (Elon Musk X post).\nThis refusal triggered solidarity actions from other unions, including dockworkers, electricians, postal workers, and even international support from Danish (3F Transport), Norwegian (Fellesforbundet), and Finnish (AKT) unions.\nThe Swedish government supported the union by banning replacement workers, and by July 2024, the strike had lasted 8 months, with more than 30 employees nationwide and 7 mechanics in Malmö deserting their workbenches.\nAs of April 2025, the strike remains ongoing with no resolution, as reported by Tesla seeks Sweden court order in protracted labour union conflict | Reuters.\n\n\n\nUSA: In the USA, unionization efforts were led by the United Auto Workers (UAW), with workers at Tesla’s Buffalo facility attempting to organize.\n\nHowever, in February 2023, Tesla fired more than 30 workers, with 18 named in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), shortly after the organizing effort was announced, as reported by Tesla accused of firing union supporters days after organizing effort starts | CNN Business.\nTesla claimed the firings were due to performance, but the union, Tesla Workers United, alleged retaliation.\nLegal battles followed, with the NLRB finding some merit in claims of unlawful workplace rules but dismissing others, as noted in Tesla beats US claim that it fired factory workers amid union campaign | Reuters.\nBy April 2025, no successful unionization has been reported, reflecting Tesla’s historical anti-union stance and weaker labor protections.\n\n\n\nStrength of the Trade Unions\nThe strength of the trade unions varied significantly between the two countries.\n\n\nSweden: The union, primarily IF Metall, appears strong due to several factors:\n\nHigh union density, with almost 90% of the Swedish workforce covered by collective agreements\nSolidarity actions from multiple unions, including dockworkers refusing to unload Tesla vehicles and international support, creating a broad blockade.\nGovernment support, such as banning replacement workers, enhancing union leverage.\nThe strike’s persistence into 2025, despite Tesla’s legal challenges, indicates resilience, with IF Metall vowing to continue.\n\n\n\nUSA: The union efforts, led by UAW, seem weaker:\n\nLower union density in the auto industry, especially for EVs, with Tesla being the only major non-union American automaker.\nTesla’s aggressive anti-union tactics, including firings and legal battles, with historical violations noted, such as a 2019 ruling by an administrative judge on illegal union-busting\nWeaker labor laws, with solidarity actions like those in Sweden being illegal in the USA, limiting union power.\n\n\n\nKey Players\npostal workers, blocking services such as license plate deliveries and waste collection.\n\n\nSweden:\n\nTrade Union: IF Metall, leading the strike, with support from 12 other unions.\nEmployers: Tesla, refusing to sign agreements, with CEO Elon Musk publicly opposing unions.\nEmployees: Mechanics and other workers, with over 30 on strike nationwide by July 2024, showing active participation.\nGovernment: Supportive, banning replacement workers and upholding labor rights\nSociety: High public support, with 90% workforce unionized\n\n\n\nUSA:\n\nTrade Union: UAW, attempting to organize, with Tesla Workers United filing complaints.\nEmployers: Tesla, resisting unionization, with firings and legal defenses.\nEmployees: Workers at Buffalo, facing retaliation, with over 30 fired in 2023.\nGovernment: NLRB involved, with mixed outcomes, finding some violations but dismissing others\nSociety: Less supportive, with lower union density and legal constraints on solidarity actions.\n\n\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nSweden: The strike is ongoing, with no resolution reported. It seems likely that the union has achieved partial success in pressuring Tesla, given the prolonged action and international attention, but Tesla’s refusal to negotiate and legal battles, such as seeking court orders for license plates, indicate no final agreement, as per Tesla seeks Sweden court order in protracted labour union conflict | Reuters.\n\n\nUSA: The unionization effort failed, with workers fired and no successful organization by UAW.

Reports from early 2025 indicate continued legal battles and solidarity actions, with no clear resolution. This has involved multiple unions blocking services like license plate deliveries, putting pressure on Tesla to sign a collective bargaining agreement, but this did not affect Tesla much. Both sides, being both big, are unwilling to budge.\nUnited States:\nIn the US, Tesla has successfully resisted unionization efforts, still with no unions representing its workers as of now. Despite attempts by the United Auto Workers (UAW) and others since 2017, and ongoing investigations into labor practices, Tesla remains the only major American automaker without union representation.\nElon Musk, as co-chair of DOGE under President Trump, has been involved in significant government reforms, posing a threat on the government branches that chooses to go against him,  rendering the weak labor laws even more weak as most investigations and oversight have ended.\n\nKey Players\npostal workers, blocking services such as license plate deliveries and waste collection.\n\n\nSweden:\n\nTrade Union: IF Metall, leading the strike, with support from 12 other unions.\nEmployers: Tesla, refusing to sign agreements, with CEO Elon Musk publicly opposing unions.\nEmployees: Mechanics and other workers, with over 30 on strike nationwide by July 2024, showing active participation.\nGovernment: Supportive, banning replacement workers and upholding labor rights\nSociety: High public support, with 90% workforce unionized\n\n\n\nUSA:\n\nTrade Union: UAW, attempting to organize, with Tesla Workers United filing complaints.\nEmployers: Tesla, resisting unionization, with firings and legal defenses.\nEmployees: Workers at Buffalo, facing retaliation, with over 30 fired in 2023.\nGovernment: NLRB involved, with mixed outcomes, finding some violations but dismissing others\nSociety: Less supportive, with lower union density and legal constraints on solidarity actions.\n\n\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_and_trade_unions\nx.com/CNBC/status/1730264559775043910\nwww.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeks-sweden-court-order-protracted-labour-union-conflict-2025-01-07/\nwww.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-beats-claim-that-it-fired-factory-workers-amid-union-campaign-2023-11-27/\nwww.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-beats-claim-that-it-fired-factory-workers-amid-union-campaign-2023-11-27/\nwww.cnn.com/2023/02/16/business/tesla-workers-fired-union/index.html\nwww.industriall-union.org/swedish-union-warns-of-strike-at-tesla"},"02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/19/Trade-Unions":{"title":"Trade Unions","links":["02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/19/Role-of-Trade-Unions"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  A trade union (also known as a labor union) \n                  \n                \n\nis an organization that exists to protect the rights of workers. protect their interests\nfor specific industries and specific occupations.\ntrade unions originated in the nineteenth century in the UK and USA\n\nworkers often worked in very poor conditions\ntrade unions were created to bargain for better terms and working environments for their members\nemployers and workers have different goals\nemployers\n\nmaximize profits\nminimize costs\nmaximize sales\n\n\nworkers\n\nmaximize earnings\nwork in a safe and healthy environments\ngood terms and conditions at work\nmaximize non-wage benefits too\nhave job security\n\n\nex. an increase in wages along with a decrease in working hours will improve conditions for workers, but increase costs for employers\n\nsome national legislations are creating rules\nex.

Product innovation occurs when a new product emerges that does things better/faster e.g. driver free cars may transform the taxi industry and lower taxi faresInvestment- When the expenditure on capital (machinery, building etc.) increases, workers are usually able to perform their jobs more efficiently resulting in higher output    - If firms hold back investment for long periods of time, their capital (machinery) degrades possibly making it harder for workers to do their jobs    - The interest rates in an economy are one of the main determinants of investment by firms.

Industry and Market Structure Analysis (Chapter 23)\n\nAnalyse the industry your firm is entering:\n\nIndustry: Personal Weather Protection Accessories, specifically focusing on the umbrella market.\nSize of the market: The general umbrella market is a large, mass market (valued globally around USD 7-8 billion and projected to grow). Our Rain Curtain Umbrella will initially target a niche market within this broader category – consumers seeking premium, innovative, and highly effective rain protection. However, given the widespread nature of the problem, it has significant potential to broaden its appeal and capture a larger market share over time.\nCompetitors and their market share:\n\nTraditional Umbrella Manufacturers: (e.g., numerous generic brands, department store brands). Hold the largest market share in the basic segment; characterized by low differentiation and high price sensitivity.\nSpecialty/Designer Umbrella Brands: Smaller market share, higher price points, often focus on aesthetics, specific materials, or basic windproof features, but generally not on comprehensive coverage.\nRaincoats/Ponchos: Indirect competitors offering full body coverage but with drawbacks in convenience, breathability, and style for many situations.\nDIY Solutions: Not commercial competitors, but their existence highlights the unmet need and dissatisfaction with standard umbrellas.\nRudimentary All-in-One Concepts: (e.g., some basic products found on platforms like Taobao). These are emerging direct competitors but often lack sophisticated design, quality materials, durability, and user-centric features. Our product aims to be a significant improvement.\n\n\nProduct Differentiation: Our Rain Curtain Umbrella is highly differentiated by its core feature – the integrated, transparent, 360-degree rain curtain. This offers demonstrably superior protection from wind-driven and slanting rain compared to any standard or most specialty umbrellas. We will also focus on quality materials, durable construction, ease of use, and thoughtful aesthetic design to further differentiate from basic alternatives.\nBarriers to Entry and Exit:\n\nEntry: Relatively low for basic umbrella manufacturing. However, for our innovative design, barriers include:\n\nDesign Patents: Securing intellectual property for our unique curtain mechanism and overall design.\nBrand Development &amp; Marketing Costs: Establishing a new brand and educating consumers about the benefits requires investment.\nManufacturing Complexity &amp; Quality Control: Ensuring a high-quality, durable product with the integrated curtain mechanism at scale.\nDistribution Channels: Building relationships with retailers or establishing effective direct-to-consumer channels.\n\n\nExit: Relatively low; assets (inventory, IP) could potentially be liquidated or sold.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify how competitive this market is and show evidence (data, graphs, charts) to support your analysis:\n\n“The general umbrella market is highly competitive, particularly at the lower end, driven by price. However, the segment for truly innovative, problem-solving, premium umbrellas is less saturated and offers opportunities for differentiation.”\nEvidence (to be presented visually in the pitch):\n\nMarket Size &amp; Growth Data: Charts showing the global umbrella market value and its projected growth (e.g., USD ~7.5B in 2023, CAGR ~5.5%).\nProblem Scale Data: Statistics on the 444 million people affected globally, highlighting key demographics and high-rainfall urban areas. (Reference Buildpad.io findings).\nVisuals of Problem: Images/short clips of people struggling with traditional umbrellas in wind and rain.\nCompetitor Landscape: A simple chart or slide showing categories of competitors and highlighting the gap our product fills (e.g., a 2x2 matrix of Protection vs. Convenience).\nConsumer Trend Data: Mentioning the growing consumer preference for high-quality, durable products and solutions for extreme weather, as identified in market reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

This common failing directly impacts a broad demographic, including daily urban commuters, students navigating campuses, business professionals needing to maintain a presentable appearance, and general outdoor pedestrians. The consequences are tangible: individuals get uncomfortably wet, their valuable belongings (such as electronics, documents, and clothing) suffer water damage, and they experience significant frustration and disruption to their day. While existing alternatives like full raincoats or improvised DIY umbrella modifications exist, they are often perceived as inconvenient, cumbersome, impractical for quick transitions, or aesthetically unappealing, leaving a substantial number of users dissatisfied and searching for a more effective and user-friendly solution.\nwww.reddit.com/r/NiceVancouver/comments/1g82jcg/whats_the_best_brand_of_umbrella_for_these/\ni.redd.it/6ony5pdr98he1.jpeg\nwww.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/5qkp1a/request_how_to_close_my_umbrella_and_get_into_my/\nwww.physicsforums.com/threads/why-do-my-umbrella-keep-flipping-in-one-direction-wind.986665/\nwww.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/w6rzm2/how_do_you_use_an_umbrella/\nPROBLEM SCALE\nThe scale of this problem is globally significant, with an estimated 444 million people worldwide regularly experiencing inadequate protection from their traditional umbrellas, particularly in challenging rainy and windy conditions. This issue is most acute and frequently encountered in:\n\nUrban centers with high annual rainfall: Cities where rain is a common occurrence, forcing daily confrontation with the limitations of standard umbrellas (e.g., New Orleans, Miami, Mumbai, Bergen).\nMajor megacities with distinct rainy seasons: Large metropolitan areas where seasonal monsoons or extended wet periods make effective rain protection essential for a vast population (e.g., Tokyo, Jakarta, São Paulo).\nRegions facing increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events: Coastal areas and other locations susceptible to climate change impacts, where stronger winds and heavier downpours render conventional umbrellas increasingly ineffective.\n\nKey affected demographics who stand to benefit most from an improved solution include:\n\nUrban commuters: Relying on walking or public transport.\nBusiness professionals: Needing to protect attire and work-related items.\nStudents: Carrying books and electronics across campuses.\nOutdoor enthusiasts: Engaging in activities where weather can change rapidly.\nParents with young children: Requiring hands-free convenience and better coverage.\n\nThis substantial and consistently growing market, underscored by increasing urbanization and shifting weather patterns, clearly reflects the widespread and unmet need for more reliable, durable, and comprehensively protective umbrella solutions.\ndataintelo.com/report/umbrellas-market\nwww.zionmarketresearch.com/report/umbrella-market\nwww.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240909160227.htm\nwww.cognitivemarketresearch.com/raincoat-umbrella-clothes-market-report\nwww.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/rainwear-market-report\nwww.researchnester.com/reports/umbrella-market/1919\nwww.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/umbrella-market/\nwww.statista.com/statistics/912263/population-of-urban-agglomerations-worldwide/\nPROBLEM IMPACT\nThe impact of inadequate umbrella protection is multifaceted, imposing considerable financial, practical, and emotional burdens on individuals:\n\nFinancial Impact: The most direct financial risk involves water damage to personal electronics, particularly smartphones and laptops. Repair or replacement costs for smartphones alone can range from 50 to 400 per incident. Considering that approximately 25% of smartphone users have experienced water damage, this translates to an annualized risk cost of approximately 12.50-18.75 per person. For individuals experiencing multiple umbrella failures or damage to more expensive items like laptops or designer clothing, this annual cost can escalate significantly, potentially reaching 87.50-187.50 or more.\nTime Impact: Dealing with the aftermath of getting wet consumes valuable time. Individuals may lose between 40 to 75 minutes per significant rain exposure event. This includes time spent changing wet clothes, drying off, attempting to salvage wet belongings, and potential delays in commute or daily activities. Annually, this can accumulate to 4.7 to 12.5 hours of lost time, which, when translated into lost productivity at average wage rates, represents a further hidden economic cost (e.g., 150-400 annually).\nEmotional &amp; Psychological Impact: Beyond the tangible costs, the emotional toll is substantial. Being caught unprepared in the rain leads to immediate physical discomfort from wet and cold clothing, significant frustration, and heightened stress levels that can persist for several hours. This can negatively affect mood, reduce concentration and productivity for the remainder of the day, and even cause embarrassment or undermine professional presence in work or social settings. The recurring nature of this frustration contributes to a generally negative perception of rainy weather experiences.\n\nCollectively, these impacts underscore the compelling need for a solution that mitigates these daily burdens.\npsychcentral.com/health/can-weather-affect-your-mood\nwww.flowsport.co.nz/blogs/news/feelings-of-discomfort-are-like-being-in-the-rain\nforum.bikeradar.com/discussion/13129947/how-do-you-cycle-commute-in-the-rain\nlifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/15845/how-can-i-dry-my-clothes-quickly-after-rain\nwww.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/water-damage-insurance-claims-statistics.html\nCURRENT SOLUTIONS &amp; THEIR LIMITATIONS\nUsers currently attempt to address the problem of inadequate rain protection through several means, each with notable drawbacks:\n\nTraditional Umbrellas:\n\nLimitation: The primary source of the problem. Standard designs offer limited coverage, are highly susceptible to inverting or breaking in moderate to strong winds, and provide minimal protection from slanting rain, leaving users’ lower bodies, bags, and shoulders exposed.\n\n\nRaincoats and Ponchos:\n\nLimitation: While offering more comprehensive coverage, they can be cumbersome to carry, hot and uncomfortable in humid conditions, inconvenient for short trips or quick transitions (e.g., entering/exiting vehicles or buildings), and may not be considered stylish or professional enough for all situations. They also don’t protect handheld items like a separate bag as effectively as an umbrella aims to.\n\n\nDIY Umbrella Modifications:\n\nLimitation: Attempts to attach plastic sheeting or other materials to existing umbrellas are often makeshift, unreliable, aesthetically unpleasing, and lack durability. They are not a practical long-term solution.\n\n\n“Storm” or Windproof Umbrellas:\n\nLimitation: While more robust against wind, they often still suffer from the same coverage limitations as traditional umbrellas regarding slanting rain and protecting belongings fully. Their primary focus is on structural integrity rather than expanded coverage.\n\n\nBasic All-in-One Umbrella/Body Cover Concepts (e.g., some Taobao findings):\n\nLimitation: Some rudimentary products exist that attempt to combine umbrella and body coverage. However, these are often characterized by basic materials, clunky designs, questionable durability, and a lack of user-centric features or aesthetic appeal. They represent an early attempt but leave significant room for improvement in quality, design, and functionality.\n\n\n\nThe persistence of these limitations across current solutions indicates a clear gap in the market for a product that effectively balances comprehensive protection, convenience, durability, and user experience.\nOPPORTUNITY\nThe widespread dissatisfaction with current rain protection methods, coupled with the significant scale and multifaceted impact of the problem, presents a compelling market opportunity for an innovative and superior solution.\n\nLarge Addressable Market: With an estimated 444 million people globally experiencing the inadequacies of traditional umbrellas, there is a vast pool of potential customers actively seeking better alternatives.\nUnmet Needs: Current solutions fail to adequately address the core user needs for comprehensive protection (especially from wind-driven rain), convenience, durability, and a positive user experience. This gap is the primary driver of the opportunity.\nWillingness to Invest in Quality: Market trends indicate a growing consumer preference for higher-quality, durable goods that provide effective solutions, even at a premium price point. The growth in the “storm umbrella” segment, despite its own limitations, signals this willingness.\nDemand for Convenience: Modern consumers, particularly urban dwellers and busy professionals, highly value convenience. A solution that seamlessly integrates enhanced protection without adding significant bulk or hassle will be highly attractive.\nFavorable Macro Trends: Increasing urbanization means more people are reliant on personal, portable weather protection. Furthermore, the growing frequency of unpredictable and extreme weather events due to climate change amplifies the need for more reliable solutions.\nInnovation Potential: The “Rain Curtain Umbrella” concept, with its integrated, transparent curtain, directly addresses the core failings of traditional umbrellas by offering 360-degree protection. This innovation can create a new product category or significantly disrupt the existing premium umbrella market.\nBranding and Differentiation: There’s an opportunity to build a strong brand around a product that genuinely solves a common frustration, focusing on quality, thoughtful design, and superior performance. This can differentiate the product from generic, low-cost alternatives and basic existing concepts.\n\nThis confluence of a large, underserved market, clear product deficiencies in existing offerings, and favorable consumer and environmental trends creates a fertile ground for the successful introduction and growth of the “Rain Curtain Umbrella.”"},"02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/22/Enterprise-Pitching-Project":{"title":"Enterprise Pitching Project","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Okay, this “Enterprise Project: The 1 Million RMB Business Pitch” document is a perfect framework for your “Rain Curtain Umbrella” idea! Let’s break down how you can structure your pitch based on these requirements, using the information from your chat.\nProject Idea: The “Rain Curtain Umbrella” (雨帘伞)\nHere’s a plan incorporating the chat discussion into the required pitch components:\n1. Business Profile\n\nBusiness Name (Brainstorm ideas):\n\nConsider names that evoke protection, clarity, all-weather, innovation.\nExamples: “Aegis Umbrellas,” “ClearShield Canopy,” “Nimbus 360,” “AquaGuard Pro,” “DrapenDri,” “全护伞 (Quán Hù Sǎn - Total Protect Umbrella),” “风雨盾 (Fēng Yǔ Dùn - Wind Rain Shield).”\nYour group should decide on one.\n\n\nSlogan (Brainstorm ideas):\n\nShould be catchy and highlight the main benefit.\nExamples: “Stay Dry, All Around.” “Your Personal Rain-Free Zone.” “The Umbrella, Reimagined.” “Don’t Just Cover Up, Enclose.” “See Clearly, Stay Completely Dry.”\nYour group should decide on one.\n\n\nWhat is your product?\n\n“Our product is the ‘Rain Curtain Umbrella,’ an innovative umbrella designed with an integrated, transparent, draping curtain that extends downwards from the canopy. This provides full 360-degree protection from rain, especially wind-driven rain, keeping not just your head but your shoulders, backpack, and even your legs significantly drier than a traditional umbrella.”\n\n\nIdentify your target consumers:\n\nPrimary:\n\nUrban Commuters &amp; Students: (Age 16-45) People who walk or use public transport daily, often carrying bags (laptops, books) that need protection. They value practicality and convenience. (Location: Urban areas, cities with significant rainfall). Income level: Mid-range, willing to pay a premium for a tangible benefit.\nParents with Young Children: Those who need hands free or want better protection for themselves and their children in strollers.\n\n\nSecondary:\n\nBusiness Professionals: (Age 25-55) Need to arrive at meetings looking presentable, without a soaked suit or briefcase. Value efficiency and a polished image.\nAnyone frustrated with traditional umbrellas: People who enjoy walking in the rain but hate getting wet from the sides (e.g., for leisure, dog walking).\n\n\n\n\nExplain why you chose this group (product):\n\n“We chose to develop the Rain Curtain Umbrella because we identified a common, everyday frustration: traditional umbrellas offer incomplete protection, especially in windy or heavy rain. We’ve all experienced getting our bags, legs, or shoulders soaked despite using an umbrella. We saw an opportunity to create a practical, enhanced solution that addresses this widespread problem, moving beyond simple DIY fixes to offer a well-designed, convenient, and more effective product.” (Reference the initial discussion about the limitations of normal umbrellas and the desire for a better solution).\n\n\n\n2. Firm Objectives (Chapter 22)\n\nState the main objectives of your business:\n\nMarket Penetration &amp; Growth: To establish the Rain Curtain Umbrella as a leading innovative solution in the personal weather protection market, capturing a significant share of consumers seeking enhanced rain protection.\nProfit Maximization: To achieve profitability within the first two years by offering a premium product with a clear value proposition that justifies a higher price point than standard umbrellas.\nBrand Building: To create a recognized brand synonymous with superior weather protection, convenience, and thoughtful design.\n(Optional) Social Impact: To improve the daily comfort and well-being of individuals during inclement weather, reducing the hassle and discomfort of getting wet.\n\n\nExplain why these objectives are suitable for your firm:\n\n“These objectives are suitable because our product offers a distinct advantage over existing solutions, creating an opportunity for growth in a new sub-segment. The enhanced utility and convenience can command a premium price, leading to profit maximization. By solving a genuine customer pain point effectively, we can build a strong brand loyalty. The inherent benefit of keeping people drier contributes to a positive social impact by improving everyday comfort.”\n\n\n\n3. Industry and Market Structure Analysis (Chapter 23)\n\nAnalyse the industry your firm is entering:\n\nIndustry: Personal Weather Protection Accessories, specifically the umbrella market.\nSize of the market: The general umbrella market is a mass market. Our Rain Curtain Umbrella initially targets a niche market within this, focusing on consumers seeking premium, enhanced protection. However, it has the potential to broaden its appeal.\nCompetitors and their market share:\n\nTraditional Umbrella Manufacturers: (e.g., local brands, generic imports). High market share in the basic segment, low differentiation, price-sensitive.\nSpecialty/Designer Umbrella Brands: Smaller market share, higher price, focus on aesthetics or specific features (e.g., windproof, compact).\nDIY Solutions: (As discussed in chat) Not direct commercial competitors, but represent an unmet need.\nSimilar existing products (like the one found on Taobao): These are direct competitors. You need to acknowledge them and highlight your potential differentiation (e.g., better design, materials, marketing, specific features you might add).\n\n\nProduct Differentiation: Our product is differentiated by its integrated full-coverage rain curtain, offering superior protection and convenience compared to standard umbrellas or the hassle of combining an umbrella with a raincoat. We aim for better aesthetics and material quality than basic all-in-one solutions.\nBarriers to Entry and Exit:\n\nEntry: Relatively low for basic umbrellas. For our specific design, a design patent could be a barrier. Establishing a brand and distribution channels requires capital and effort. Manufacturing at scale.\nExit: Low, assets can be liquidated.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify how competitive this market is and show evidence:\n\n“The general umbrella market is highly competitive, primarily driven by price for basic models. However, the segment for innovative, value-added umbrellas is less saturated.”\nEvidence (You’ll need to find/create this for the pitch):\n\nShow a slide with images of people struggling with normal umbrellas in wind/rain (social media screenshots, stock photos).\nA simple chart showing the large size of the general umbrella market and a smaller, growing segment for “premium/innovative” weather gear.\nMention the Taobao product as evidence of existing interest in such solutions, but frame yours as an improvement.\nQuote statistics about rainfall in your target geographic areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Cost and Investment Plan (Chapter 21-22) - How to spend 1 million RMB\n\n“If we receive 1 million RMB, we would allocate it as follows:”\n\nStart-up Costs (Approx. 250,000 RMB):\n\nProduct Refinement &amp; Prototyping (100,000 RMB): Based on the sample purchased and further design, create professional prototypes. Test materials for durability, transparency, and ease of use.\nDesign Patents &amp; Legal (50,000 RMB): Secure intellectual property for our unique design features.\nInitial Small-Scale Production Run (100,000 RMB): To have inventory for launch and further testing.\n\n\nMarketing and Branding (Approx. 400,000 RMB):\n\nBrand Identity Development (50,000 RMB): Professional logo, packaging design, brand guidelines.\nDigital Marketing Launch (250,000 RMB): Social media campaigns (targeting students, commuters), influencer collaborations (showcasing the product in real-world scenarios), search engine marketing.\nContent Creation (50,000 RMB): High-quality photos and videos demonstrating the product’s benefits.\nE-commerce Website Development (50,000 RMB): A user-friendly online store.\n\n\nStaffing and Training (Initial Core Team - Approx. 200,000 RMB for 6-12 months runway for key roles):\n\nPart-time/Contract: Product Designer, Marketing Specialist. (Initially, the group members might fill these roles, but investment allows for specialized help).\nCustomer service setup.\n\n\nTechnology and Equipment (Approx. 50,000 RMB):\n\nBasic office software, communication tools.\nInventory management system (basic initially).\n\n\nOther Relevant Areas (Contingency - Approx. 100,000 RMB):\n\nUnforeseen expenses, exploring initial distribution partnerships, further market research.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Development Plan (Chapter 20)\n\nWill your firm aim to expand or stay small?\n\n“Our firm will aim to expand.”\n\n\nJustify your choice:\n\n“The problem our Rain Curtain Umbrella solves is widespread. We believe there’s a significant market opportunity beyond an initial niche. Expansion will allow us to achieve economies of scale in production, reducing costs. We also envision a future product line with variations (e.g., different sizes, styles, kid’s versions, UV protection curtains for sun) and potential for international market entry. Staying small would limit our impact and potential to become a recognized leader in innovative weather protection.”\n\n\n\n6. Strategies to Achieve Goals\n\n“We will use the following key strategies to meet our objectives:”\n\nFocus on Product Innovation and Quality: Continuously refine the Rain Curtain Umbrella based on customer feedback, ensuring superior materials, durability, and user experience. This will be our core differentiator.

Good luck!\n\nProject/Idea Name: Rain Curtain Umbrella (You can refine this later, e.g., “AuraShield Umbrellas,” “Nimbus 360 Canopy”)\n1. The Problem We’re Solving:\n\n“Traditional umbrellas offer inadequate protection against rain, especially when it’s windy or slanting. Users frequently experience getting their shoulders, backpacks, bags, and lower body wet, despite using an umbrella.”\n“This leads to discomfort, potential damage to belongings (like books, electronics), and a generally negative experience during rainy weather commutes or outings.”\n“Current alternatives like full raincoats can be cumbersome for quick trips or not ideal for all situations (e.g., business attire). DIY solutions (like attaching plastic sheets to umbrellas) are often impractical, unaesthetic, and unreliable.”\n“Specific pain point: Individuals carrying items (students with school bags, professionals with briefcases, shoppers) struggle to keep both themselves and their belongings fully dry.”\n\n2. Our Proposed Solution:\n\n“The ‘Rain Curtain Umbrella’ is an enhanced umbrella featuring an integrated, transparent, lightweight curtain that extends downwards from the main canopy.”\n“This curtain provides 360-degree protection, creating a personal ‘bubble’ that shields the user and their immediate belongings (like a backpack or shoulder bag) much more effectively from rain, especially wind-driven rain.”\n“It’s designed to be a convenient, all-in-one solution that is easy to deploy and retract, offering superior protection without the bulk of a full raincoat or the hassle of DIY.”\n\n3. Target Customers / Audience Segments:\n\nPrimary:\n\nUrban Commuters &amp; Students: Individuals (e.g., aged 16-45) who walk or use public transport regularly in varying weather conditions, often carrying bags that need protection. They value practicality and efficiency.\n\n\nSecondary:\n\nParents with Young Children: Those who might be pushing strollers or need to keep an extra hand free while ensuring they and their child stay drier.\nBusiness Professionals: Individuals who need to arrive at meetings looking presentable and want to avoid getting their attire or work bags soaked.\nAnyone seeking enhanced comfort: People who enjoy being outdoors but are frustrated by the limitations of standard umbrellas (e.g., dog walkers, leisure walkers).\n\n\n\n4. Unique Value Proposition (UVP) / Why We’re Different:\n\n“Stay Drier, All Around: Unlike standard umbrellas, the Rain Curtain Umbrella offers significantly enhanced, near full-body protection from rain, especially in windy conditions.”\n“Effortless Convenience: An integrated, ready-to-use solution that’s more practical and reliable than DIY attempts and less cumbersome than carrying separate rain gear for moderate rain.”\n“Maintain Visibility &amp; Comfort: The transparent curtain ensures the user can see their surroundings clearly, and the design aims to be less restrictive than a full raincoat.”\n“Protect Your Belongings: Specifically designed to help shield backpacks, shoulder bags, and other carried items from getting wet.”\n(Aspirational, based on your Taobao find): “We aim to offer a more thoughtfully designed, higher-quality, and aesthetically pleasing version compared to very basic, existing all-in-one concepts.”\n\n5. Key Features (Planned or Envisioned):\n\nIntegrated, retractable transparent rain curtain.\nDurable and lightweight umbrella frame.\nEasy-to-use deployment mechanism for both umbrella and curtain.\nHigh-quality, clear, and resilient curtain material.\nVariety of sizes/styles (future consideration).\nSecure fastening for the curtain when deployed.\n\n6. Existing Alternatives &amp; Our Differentiation:\n\nTraditional Umbrellas: Offer only top-down protection, easily compromised by wind.\nRaincoats/Ponchos: Offer full protection but can be bulky, hot, and inconvenient to put on/take off for short periods.\nDIY Umbrella Modifications: Unreliable, often look makeshift, not durable.\nBasic All-in-One Umbrella/Raincoat Hybrids (like the Taobao find): We differentiate by aiming for superior design, better material quality, improved user experience (e.g., ease of deployment, better aesthetics), and stronger branding. We are not just a utility item, but an enhanced experience.\n\n7. What We Want to Achieve / Next Steps (for Buildpad.io context):\n\n“Validate the core problem and our proposed solution with a wider audience.”\n“Refine the key features and design based on user feedback.”\n“Identify the most promising customer segments and marketing channels.”\n“Explore potential manufacturing and cost structures.”\n“Develop a go-to-market strategy.”\n“Currently, we have conceptualized the idea, identified a basic existing product for reference, and are preparing an initial business pitch. We have purchased a sample of an existing similar product for analysis.”\n\n\nBased on the search results provided, I’ll analyze whether there’s confirmation that traditional umbrellas provide inadequate protection against rain, especially in windy or slanting rain conditions.\nLooking at the evidence from the documents:\nA person who recently traveled to a wet area reported that despite using an umbrella daily, they still get wet. They questioned whether umbrellas are useless or if they simply don’t know how to use them properly.\nSeveral respondents confirmed this experience, noting that you can still get wet with an umbrella, especially if it’s raining heavily or if wind is blowing the rain sideways. The size of the umbrella can also be a factor in how effective it is.\nAnother person explicitly stated, “You get wet even with an umbrella. It doesn’t protect all of you, it’s mostly just for the head.” They mentioned that while using an umbrella protects their hairstyle, they still get rain on their pants and shirt.\nOne person described a common frustration with umbrellas during windy conditions: “Today, I was walking during a heavy rain with winds. But I swear to you, the wind kept blowing in one direction. Despite this, the umbrella kept inverting.” This speaks directly to the problem of umbrella inadequacy in windy conditions.\nAnother user was specifically searching for solutions to a common umbrella problem: how to close their umbrella and get into their car without getting wet. They noted: “Simply closing my umbrella and getting in results in getting wet during the time the umbrella is down. I could get in with my arm out the door and close the umbrella behind me, but then it gets me wet when I bring it into the car.”\nThe frustration with umbrellas in wind is so common that it’s even the subject of humor, with one social media post joking: “when i’m walking to class and the wind flips my umbrella inside out and messes with my vibe so now i have to drop out and kill myself.” A commenter responded suggesting that “Capes… Just sayin’” don’t flip inside out in the wind.\nAnother user specifically asked for recommendations for umbrellas that can withstand “atmospheric rivers and wind” and “won’t turn inside out at the first site of wind,” further confirming this is a common problem.\nRecommendations in response included suggestions to use “A good rain jacket w a hood that stays put is better than an umbrella that you can’t open because of the wind” and specific umbrella brands like “Costco umbrella by ShedRain” and “Blunt umbrella which are modular and repairable.”\nThe evidence clearly confirms that the problem statement accurately describes a real issue that people experience. Multiple independent sources describe the inadequacy of traditional umbrellas in windy conditions, the problem of getting wet despite using an umbrella, and the frustration when umbrellas invert in the wind. The documents also show that people actively seek solutions to these problems and discuss alternatives.\nBased on this research, I can confidently say that your problem statement represents a genuine issue that affects many people. Traditional umbrellas do indeed provide inadequate protection against rain, especially in windy or slanting rain conditions, leading to wet clothing, damaged belongings, and frustrating experiences.\n\n\nEnterprise Project: The 1 Million RMB Business Pitch\nProject: The Rain Curtain Umbrella\n1.

Strategies to Achieve Goals\n\n“We will employ the following key strategies to achieve our business objectives:”\n\nProduct Excellence &amp; Continuous Innovation: Our primary strategy is to deliver a demonstrably superior product. This involves meticulous design, use of high-quality and durable materials, and a commitment to continuous refinement based on customer feedback and ongoing R&amp;D. This will be our core differentiator and the foundation for brand loyalty and premium pricing.\nTargeted Digital-First Marketing &amp; Community Engagement: We will leverage online channels to precisely reach our identified target demographics (urban commuters, students, professionals) with compelling, benefit-driven content. This includes social media marketing, influencer collaborations, and content marketing that showcases the product solving real-world problems. We will also foster an online community to gather feedback, build brand advocacy, and drive word-of-mouth referrals.\nStrategic Partnerships &amp; Multi-Channel Distribution: While initially focusing on direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce to control the brand experience and margins, we will strategically explore partnerships with select online retailers, specialty stores (e.g., travel, outdoor gear, department stores), and potentially B2B opportunities (e.g., corporate gifting, hospitality industry) to expand our reach and accessibility as we scale.\n\n\n\n7. Visual Aid\n\n“Our primary visual aid for the pitch will be a functional prototype of the Rain Curtain Umbrella. We have purchased an existing similar product from Taobao which will serve as an initial physical example to demonstrate the core concept and allow us to highlight our planned improvements in design, materials, and functionality.”\n“This will be supported by a concise PowerPoint presentation featuring:\n\nOur Business Name, Slogan, and (Optional) Logo.\nCompelling visuals illustrating the problem (people struggling with rain).\nClear images or mockups of our envisioned solution (the Rain Curtain Umbrella) highlighting its key features and benefits (e.g., 360° protection, clear view).\nKey data points on market size and problem scale (infographic style).\nA brief overview of our target market segments.\nA summary of our investment ask and allocation plan (if we receive the 1M RMB).\nMinimal text, focusing on strong visuals, charts, and impactful keywords to support the spoken pitch.”\n\n\n(Optional: A physical poster summarizing key points could also be used.)\n\n\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nTraditional umbrellas provide inadequate protection against rain, especially in windy or slanting conditions, causing urban commuters, students, and outdoor pedestrians to get wet, damage their belongings, and experience frustration. Existing alternatives like raincoats or DIY solutions are often inconvenient or impractical, leaving many users dissatisfied.\nPROBLEM SCALE\nApproximately 444 million people worldwide experience inadequate protection from traditional umbrellas in rainy, windy conditions. This problem is most acute in urban centers with high rainfall, major megacities with rainy seasons, and regions facing increasing extreme weather events. Key affected demographics include urban commuters, business professionals, students, outdoor enthusiasts, and parents with young children in rainy regions. This substantial and growing market reflects the widespread need for improved, durable umbrella solutions.\nPROBLEM IMPACT\nInadequate umbrella protection leads to significant and multifaceted impacts on individuals. Financially, it poses a risk of smartphone water damage with repair or replacement costs that can annualize to approximately 12.50-18.75 per person, potentially reaching 87.50-187.50 annually considering multiple exposures. Time-wise, individuals may lose between 40 to 75 minutes per rainy commute due to changing wet clothes, drying off, and dealing with damaged items, totaling around 4.7 to 12.5 hours annually, which equates to substantial lost productivity. Emotionally, being caught in the rain causes discomfort, frustration, increased stress for several hours, reduced focus and productivity, and can negatively affect mood and professional presence. Together, these impacts highlight the considerable financial, practical, and emotional burdens caused by insufficient umbrella protection.\nCURRENT SOLUTIONS\nNo data available\nOPPORTUNITY\nNo data available\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nTraditional umbrellas provide demonstrably inadequate protection against rain, especially in prevalent conditions such as windy or slanting rain. This common failing directly impacts a broad demographic, including daily urban commuters, students navigating campuses, business professionals needing to maintain a presentable appearance, and general outdoor pedestrians. The consequences are tangible: individuals get uncomfortably wet, their valuable belongings (such as electronics, documents, and clothing) suffer water damage, and they experience significant frustration and disruption to their day. While existing alternatives like full raincoats or improvised DIY umbrella modifications exist, they are often perceived as inconvenient, cumbersome, impractical for quick transitions, or aesthetically unappealing, leaving a substantial number of users dissatisfied and searching for a more effective and user-friendly solution.\nwww.reddit.com/r/NiceVancouver/comments/1g82jcg/whats_the_best_brand_of_umbrella_for_these/\ni.redd.it/6ony5pdr98he1.jpeg\nwww.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/5qkp1a/request_how_to_close_my_umbrella_and_get_into_my/\nwww.physicsforums.com/threads/why-do-my-umbrella-keep-flipping-in-one-direction-wind.986665/\nwww.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/w6rzm2/how_do_you_use_an_umbrella/\nPROBLEM SCALE\nThe scale of this problem is globally significant, with an estimated 444 million people worldwide regularly experiencing inadequate protection from their traditional umbrellas, particularly in challenging rainy and windy conditions. This issue is most acute and frequently encountered in:\n\nUrban centers with high annual rainfall: Cities where rain is a common occurrence, forcing daily confrontation with the limitations of standard umbrellas (e.g., New Orleans, Miami, Mumbai, Bergen).\nMajor megacities with distinct rainy seasons: Large metropolitan areas where seasonal monsoons or extended wet periods make effective rain protection essential for a vast population (e.g., Tokyo, Jakarta, São Paulo).\nRegions facing increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events: Coastal areas and other locations susceptible to climate change impacts, where stronger winds and heavier downpours render conventional umbrellas increasingly ineffective.\n\nKey affected demographics who stand to benefit most from an improved solution include:\n\nUrban commuters: Relying on walking or public transport.\nBusiness professionals: Needing to protect attire and work-related items.\nStudents: Carrying books and electronics across campuses.\nOutdoor enthusiasts: Engaging in activities where weather can change rapidly.\nParents with young children: Requiring hands-free convenience and better coverage.\n\nThis substantial and consistently growing market, underscored by increasing urbanization and shifting weather patterns, clearly reflects the widespread and unmet need for more reliable, durable, and comprehensively protective umbrella solutions.\ndataintelo.com/report/umbrellas-market\nwww.zionmarketresearch.com/report/umbrella-market\nwww.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240909160227.htm\nwww.cognitivemarketresearch.com/raincoat-umbrella-clothes-market-report\nwww.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/rainwear-market-report\nwww.researchnester.com/reports/umbrella-market/1919\nwww.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/umbrella-market/\nwww.statista.com/statistics/912263/population-of-urban-agglomerations-worldwide/\nPROBLEM IMPACT\nThe impact of inadequate umbrella protection is multifaceted, imposing considerable financial, practical, and emotional burdens on individuals:\n\nFinancial Impact: The most direct financial risk involves water damage to personal electronics, particularly smartphones and laptops. Repair or replacement costs for smartphones alone can range from 50 to 400 per incident. Considering that approximately 25% of smartphone users have experienced water damage, this translates to an annualized risk cost of approximately 12.50-18.75 per person. For individuals experiencing multiple umbrella failures or damage to more expensive items like laptops or designer clothing, this annual cost can escalate significantly, potentially reaching 87.50-187.50 or more.\nTime Impact: Dealing with the aftermath of getting wet consumes valuable time. Individuals may lose between 40 to 75 minutes per significant rain exposure event. This includes time spent changing wet clothes, drying off, attempting to salvage wet belongings, and potential delays in commute or daily activities. Annually, this can accumulate to 4.7 to 12.5 hours of lost time, which, when translated into lost productivity at average wage rates, represents a further hidden economic cost (e.g., 150-400 annually).\nEmotional &amp; Psychological Impact: Beyond the tangible costs, the emotional toll is substantial. Being caught unprepared in the rain leads to immediate physical discomfort from wet and cold clothing, significant frustration, and heightened stress levels that can persist for several hours. This can negatively affect mood, reduce concentration and productivity for the remainder of the day, and even cause embarrassment or undermine professional presence in work or social settings. The recurring nature of this frustration contributes to a generally negative perception of rainy weather experiences.\n\nCollectively, these impacts underscore the compelling need for a solution that mitigates these daily burdens.\npsychcentral.com/health/can-weather-affect-your-mood\nwww.flowsport.co.nz/blogs/news/feelings-of-discomfort-are-like-being-in-the-rain\nforum.bikeradar.com/discussion/13129947/how-do-you-cycle-commute-in-the-rain\nlifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/15845/how-can-i-dry-my-clothes-quickly-after-rain\nwww.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/water-damage-insurance-claims-statistics.html\nCURRENT SOLUTIONS &amp; THEIR LIMITATIONS\nUsers currently attempt to address the problem of inadequate rain protection through several means, each with notable drawbacks:\n\nTraditional Umbrellas:\n\nLimitation: The primary source of the problem. Standard designs offer limited coverage, are highly susceptible to inverting or breaking in moderate to strong winds, and provide minimal protection from slanting rain, leaving users’ lower bodies, bags, and shoulders exposed.\n\n\nRaincoats and Ponchos:\n\nLimitation: While offering more comprehensive coverage, they can be cumbersome to carry, hot and uncomfortable in humid conditions, inconvenient for short trips or quick transitions (e.g., entering/exiting vehicles or buildings), and may not be considered stylish or professional enough for all situations. They also don’t protect handheld items like a separate bag as effectively as an umbrella aims to.\n\n\nDIY Umbrella Modifications:\n\nLimitation: Attempts to attach plastic sheeting or other materials to existing umbrellas are often makeshift, unreliable, aesthetically unpleasing, and lack durability. They are not a practical long-term solution.\n\n\n“Storm” or Windproof Umbrellas:\n\nLimitation: While more robust against wind, they often still suffer from the same coverage limitations as traditional umbrellas regarding slanting rain and protecting belongings fully. Their primary focus is on structural integrity rather than expanded coverage.\n\n\nBasic All-in-One Umbrella/Body Cover Concepts (e.g., some Taobao findings):\n\nLimitation: Some rudimentary products exist that attempt to combine umbrella and body coverage. However, these are often characterized by basic materials, clunky designs, questionable durability, and a lack of user-centric features or aesthetic appeal. They represent an early attempt but leave significant room for improvement in quality, design, and functionality.\n\n\n\nThe persistence of these limitations across current solutions indicates a clear gap in the market for a product that effectively balances comprehensive protection, convenience, durability, and user experience.\nOPPORTUNITY\nThe widespread dissatisfaction with current rain protection methods, coupled with the significant scale and multifaceted impact of the problem, presents a compelling market opportunity for an innovative and superior solution.\n\nLarge Addressable Market: With an estimated 444 million people globally experiencing the inadequacies of traditional umbrellas, there is a vast pool of potential customers actively seeking better alternatives.\nUnmet Needs: Current solutions fail to adequately address the core user needs for comprehensive protection (especially from wind-driven rain), convenience, durability, and a positive user experience. This gap is the primary driver of the opportunity.\nWillingness to Invest in Quality: Market trends indicate a growing consumer preference for higher-quality, durable goods that provide effective solutions, even at a premium price point. The growth in the “storm umbrella” segment, despite its own limitations, signals this willingness.\nDemand for Convenience: Modern consumers, particularly urban dwellers and busy professionals, highly value convenience. A solution that seamlessly integrates enhanced protection without adding significant bulk or hassle will be highly attractive.\nFavorable Macro Trends: Increasing urbanization means more people are reliant on personal, portable weather protection. Furthermore, the growing frequency of unpredictable and extreme weather events due to climate change amplifies the need for more reliable solutions.\nInnovation Potential: The “Rain Curtain Umbrella” concept, with its integrated, transparent curtain, directly addresses the core failings of traditional umbrellas by offering 360-degree protection. This innovation can create a new product category or significantly disrupt the existing premium umbrella market.\nBranding and Differentiation: There’s an opportunity to build a strong brand around a product that genuinely solves a common frustration, focusing on quality, thoughtful design, and superior performance. This can differentiate the product from generic, low-cost alternatives and basic existing concepts.\n\nThis confluence of a large, underserved market, clear product deficiencies in existing offerings, and favorable consumer and environmental trends creates a fertile ground for the successful introduction and growth of the “Rain Curtain Umbrella.”\n"},"02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/22/Firms'-Cost":{"title":"Firms' Cost","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In preparing goods/services for sale, firms incur a range of costs.

Too much choice: consumers may be overwhelmed and not explore the full range of market offerings, instead sticking to what they know    - Worker welfare: the greater the competition the greater the need to cut costs, often resulting in low wages and poor working environmentsvegetable market is homogenous\nCharacteristics of Monopoly Markets\n\n\nA monopoly is a market structure in which there is a single seller\n\n\nThere are no substitute products\n\n\nThe firm has complete market power and is able to set prices and control output\n\n\nThis allows the firm to maximize profit\n\n\nThere is no long-run erosion of profit levels as competitors are unable to enter the industry\n\n\n\n\nHigh barriers to entry exist\n\n\nOne of the main barriers is the ability of the monopoly to prevent any competition from entering the market\n\nE.g. By purchasing companies who are a potential threat, advertising expenditure to enter\n\n\n\n\n\nMany governments define a monopoly as any firm having more than 25% market share\n\n\nRegulators act to prevent market share increasing beyond this level\n\n\nIt helps to maintain competition within the market\n\n\n\n\nImperfect knowledge\n\n\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of Monopoly Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholderAdvantagesDisadvantagesThe Firm- Large profits generate money for continued investment in technology and product innovation    - Market power enables the firm to increase its global competitiveness    - Economies of scale can increase thereby lowering the average cost    - Price discrimination: the firm can charge consumers different prices based on the different price elasticity of demand for the product e.g. peak (inelastic) and off-peak (elastic) travel on trains- Due to a lack of competition, there is a reduced incentive to be efficient    - Cross subsidization can create inefficiencies    - Monopolies lead to a misallocation of resources as they limit supply in order to increase price    - Due to a lack of competition, innovation sometimes lacks effectivenessEmployees- Large profits often result in higher wages- Having only one supplier in the industry limits the opportunity to change employersConsumers- Product innovation due to the firm’s large profits may result in a better-quality product    - Cross subsidisation can lower prices on some products that the firm provides    - Prices may fall If firms pass on their cost savings to consumers (due to economies of scale) in the form of lower product prices- A lack of competition is likely to result in higher prices as no substitute goods are available    - A lack of competition may result in no product innovation and worse product quality over time    - May experience worse customer service as the incentive to improve it is limited    - Cross subsidisation is likely to increase prices on some products offered by the firmSuppliers- Increased sales volume for some suppliers as they are able to supply products that are distributed nationally or internationally- There is less competition for their products and a monopoly often has the power to dictate what price they will pay to suppliers"},"02_areas/ECON/03Microeconomic-Decision-Makers/Microeconomic-Decision-Makers":{"title":"Microeconomic Decision Makers","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"02_areas/ECON/04Government-and-the-Macroeconomy/24/The-Role-of-the-Government":{"title":"The Role of the Government","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"02_areas/ECON/04Government-and-the-Macroeconomy/25/The-Macroeconomic-Aims-of-the-Government":{"title":"The Macroeconomic Aims of the Government","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"02_areas/ECON/04Government-and-the-Macroeconomy/26/Analysis-of-the-Global-Financial-Crisis-Script":{"title":"Analysis of the Global Financial Crisis Script","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The financial crisis of 2008 was the most severe global economic shock since the Great Depression.

It keeps your voice but adds clear theory links, key data, evaluation, and a brief self-reflection note.\nTitle: 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis: Causes, Macroeconomic Impacts, and Government Responses\n\nEvent Causes (link to theory)\n\n\nOverview: The 2008 crisis began in the U.S. housing market after a credit-fueled boom. Low policy rates in the early 2000s and global savings inflows reduced borrowing costs, boosting aggregate demand (AD) for housing and pushing prices above fundamentals.\nSubprime lending and securitization: High-risk mortgages were bundled into MBS/CDOs and sold globally. Information asymmetry and adverse selection meant investors underestimated default risk. Moral hazard arose because originators earned fees upfront and did not hold the loans.\nLeverage and the shadow banking system: Investment banks and off‑balance‑sheet vehicles used high leverage. With little regulation and thin capital buffers, small losses wiped out equity, triggering fire sales.\nTrigger: When U.S. house prices began to fall (Case‑Shiller national index declined roughly 27% from 2006 peak to 2012 trough), defaults rose, MBS prices plunged, and confidence collapsed. The failure of Lehman Brothers (15 Sept 2008) caused a sudden stop in interbank lending.\nTransmission internationally: Globalized finance spread losses to European banks; world credit conditions tightened, cutting investment and trade.\n\n\nMacroeconomic Impacts (clear indicators + AD/AS link)\n\n\nGDP: U.S. real GDP fell about 4% from peak (2007 Q4) to trough (2009 Q2). Many economies entered recession; world output growth turned negative in 2009.\nUnemployment: U.S. unemployment rose to 10.0% in Oct 2009. UK unemployment peaked near 8%. This is consistent with a leftward shift of AD (fall in C and I) and negative multiplier effects.\nInflation: Disinflation and brief deflation scares in 2009 as spare capacity increased; inflation fell below targets in several advanced economies.\nTrade and investment: Global trade volumes dropped sharply in 2009; firms cut capital spending as credit tightened and expectations worsened.\nFinancial markets: Bank lending and commercial paper markets froze; risk premia surged, raising the cost of borrowing for households and firms.\n\n\nGovernment Interventions and Evaluation\nMonetary policy (U.S. Federal Reserve as example)\n\n\nInterest rate cuts: Federal funds rate reduced to 0–0.25% by Dec 2008 to stimulate AD via lower borrowing costs.\nLender of last resort (LOLR): Emergency facilities provided liquidity to banks, primary dealers, money market funds, and commercial paper issuers—aimed at restoring confidence and preventing credit market failure.\nQuantitative Easing (QE): Large‑scale purchases of Treasuries and MBS lowered long‑term yields, supporting investment and housing through the interest rate and asset price channels.\n\nFiscal policy (stabilization of AD)\n\nTARP (Oct 2008): Treasury injected capital into banks and rescued AIG to stabilize the financial system and restore the credit channel. Although controversial, the net fiscal cost was modest relative to initial authorization.\nARRA (Feb 2009): About $831 billion in spending and tax cuts. Through the government expenditure and tax multipliers, it raised AD to reduce the negative output gap.\n\nRegulatory and supervisory actions\n\nStress tests (2009): Forced banks to recognize losses and raise capital, improving transparency and confidence.\nPost-crisis reforms (brief): Higher capital and liquidity standards, central clearing for derivatives, and ongoing stress testing aimed to reduce systemic risk and moral hazard.\n\nEffectiveness (weighing benefits and limitations)\n\nBenefits: Most economists conclude these policies prevented a second Great Depression. Output and employment outcomes were significantly better than “no-policy” scenarios. Liquidity support thawed credit markets; fiscal stimulus boosted short-run AD.\nCosts/risks: Moral hazard from bailouts (“too big to fail”); perceived inequity (asset price gains benefited wealthier households); political limits constrained fiscal size/duration; prolonged low rates may encourage risk‑taking.\nOverall judgment: Economically effective at the core objective—stabilizing the financial system and supporting recovery—with manageable long‑run fiscal cost, but distributional and incentive concerns remain.\n\n\nLinking back to IGCSE concepts (make these cues visible on the poster)\n\n\nAD/AS diagram: Show leftward AD shift in 2008–09 and rightward shift from policy stimulus.\nMacroeconomic objectives: Growth, low unemployment, low inflation, external stability. Note trade‑offs: stimulus vs. inflation risk; bailouts vs. moral hazard.\nPolicy tools: Monetary (interest rates, QE), fiscal (G and T), supply‑side/regulatory (capital requirements, supervision).\nMultiplier and transmission: Explain how credit conditions amplify AD changes.\n\n\nQuick data box (include on slides/poster with sources)\n\n\nU.S. GDP: −4% peak‑to‑trough (2007 Q4–2009 Q2)\nU.S. unemployment: peak 10.0% (Oct 2009)\nHouse prices: Case‑Shiller national index fell ~27% from 2006 peak to trough\nARRA size: ~$831 bn; Policy rates: 0–0.25% by Dec 2008\n\n\n\nConclusion (30–40 seconds)\nThe crisis reflected excessive leverage, information failures, and regulatory gaps that turned a housing downturn into a systemic shock. Monetary, fiscal, and financial‑stability policies—while imperfect—worked together to restore confidence, support AD, and limit output and employment losses. Future policy must balance stability with incentives to reduce moral hazard and improve the resilience of the financial system.\n\n\nSelf-reflection note (for rubric item 5)\n\n\n\nOur team divided tasks: research (X), data/graphs (Y), script/design (Z). We iterated with peer feedback, improved theory links (AD/AS, multipliers), and added sources. Next time, we would include more comparative international data and interview a local banker to strengthen real‑world relevance.\n\n\nTitle: 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — Causes, Impacts, and Policy Responses\nOpening\nToday I’ll explain the 2008–09 global financial crisis using IGCSE Economics ideas from chapters 24–26: aggregate demand and supply, macro objectives, and policy tools. I’ll cover causes, macroeconomic impacts, government interventions, and an evaluation.\n\nWhat caused the crisis?\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, very low interest rates and global savings inflows made credit cheap. This boosted aggregate demand for housing and pushed prices above fundamentals.\nBanks expanded high‑risk “subprime” mortgages. These loans were bundled into mortgage‑backed securities and CDOs and sold worldwide. Because of information asymmetry and adverse selection, many investors underestimated the true default risk. There was moral hazard too: lenders earned fees up front and didn’t keep the loans.\nThe shadow banking system used high leverage with light regulation. Small price falls could wipe out capital and force fire sales.\nFrom 2006, U.S. house prices began to drop. As defaults rose, the prices of mortgage securities collapsed. Confidence evaporated. When Lehman Brothers failed on 15 September 2008, interbank lending froze and the shock spread globally via integrated financial markets.\n\n\nMacroeconomic impacts\n\n\nAggregate demand shifted left as consumption and investment fell and credit conditions tightened. Negative multiplier effects deepened the downturn.\nReal GDP in the U.S. fell about 4% from 2007 Q4 to 2009 Q2. Many economies experienced recessions; world output growth turned negative in 2009.\nUnemployment rose sharply: the U.S. rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009; the UK peak was around 8%. Spare capacity increased and inflation dropped, with brief deflation fears in 2009.\nTrade volumes and business investment fell steeply. Risk premia and borrowing costs jumped even as policy rates fell, because banks were repairing their balance sheets.\n\n\nGovernment interventions\nMonetary policy\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut its policy rate to 0–0.25% by December 2008 to lower borrowing costs and support AD.\nAs lender of last resort, it created emergency facilities to supply liquidity to banks, primary dealers, money market funds, and the commercial paper market, aiming to unblock credit flows.\nWith short‑term rates at zero, the Fed used Quantitative Easing—large‑scale purchases of government bonds and mortgage securities—to reduce long‑term yields and support housing and investment through the interest rate and asset price channels.\n\nFiscal and financial stabilization\n\nIn October 2008, the U.S. Treasury launched TARP. Instead of slowly buying “toxic assets,” it injected capital directly into banks, rescued AIG, and provided emergency support to the auto industry. Although controversial, the net fiscal cost ended up modest relative to the initial $700 billion authorization.\nIn February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—about $831 billion in spending and tax cuts—raised aggregate demand through the government expenditure and tax multipliers.\nSupervisors ran public “stress tests” in 2009 to force weak banks to raise capital, improving transparency and confidence.\n\n\nEvaluation against macro objectives\n\n\nGrowth and employment: The combination of liquidity support, QE, and fiscal stimulus helped prevent a far deeper output collapse and even higher unemployment. Most economists conclude the response averted a repeat of the Great Depression by stabilizing the financial system and shifting AD back toward potential output.\nPrice stability: Policy acted during disinflation, so inflation stayed low. QE risked higher future inflation, but that did not materialize immediately.\nEquity and incentives: Benefits were uneven—asset price gains largely helped wealthier households. Bailouts may reinforce “too big to fail,” creating moral hazard.\nPublic finances and long‑run risks: Fiscal costs were manageable compared with the potential losses from a systemic collapse, but prolonged low interest rates may encourage risk‑taking and future financial instability.\n\nConclusion\nThe crisis was driven by cheap credit, risky lending, securitization, high leverage, and regulatory gaps that turned a housing downturn into a global shock. Policy makers used monetary, fiscal, and regulatory tools together: rate cuts, emergency lending, quantitative easing, capital injections, stress tests, and fiscal stimulus. While imperfect and politically controversial, these measures were economically effective at the core goal—restoring confidence, supporting aggregate demand, and limiting losses in output and employment—while leaving lessons about distribution, regulation, and moral hazard for the future."},"02_areas/ECON/04Government-and-the-Macroeconomy/26/Analysis-of-the-Global-Financial-Crisis":{"title":"Analysis of the Global Financial Crisis","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"G2 Assessment 1 Group Project 2024-25\n\n\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 was the most severe global economic shock since the Great Depression.

Macroeconomic Impact on the U.S.\nuse simple line charts to show the changes\n\nEconomic Growth (GDP):\n\nWhat happened? Negative economic growth. Real GDP fell -5.1% from late 2007 to mid-2009.\nWhy? A sharp fall in Aggregate Demand (AD) as both Consumer Spending (C) and business Investment (I) collapsed due to the credit crunch and loss of wealth.\n\n\nUnemployment:\n\nWhat happened? A surge in cyclical unemployment. The rate peaked at 10.2% in Oct 2009 (over 7 million jobs lost).\nWhy? As AD fell, firms cut production and laid off workers to reduce costs, leading to widespread unemployment tied to the economic downturn.\n\n\nPrice Stability (Inflation):\n\nWhat happened? The aim of low, stable inflation was missed; the economy experienced deflation (falling prices) in 2009.\nWhy? The severe fall in Aggregate Demand created strong deflationary pressure, as there was too little spending in the economy.\n\n\n\n\n3. Policy Responses to the Recession\nExpansionary Monetary Policy (The Federal Reserve)\n\nGoal: Increase Aggregate Demand by making borrowing cheaper.\nAction: Cut interest rates to near-zero to encourage consumer spending (C) and business investment (I).\nAction: Began Quantitative Easing (QE) to increase the money supply and inject liquidity into frozen credit markets.\n\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy (The U.S. Government)\n\nGoal: Increase Aggregate Demand directly and through multiplier effects.\nAction: Increased Government Spending (G) via the ARRA stimulus package on infrastructure and aid.\nAction: Bank bailouts (TARP) and tax cuts to restore confidence and encourage spending (C).\n\nEvaluation: Did the Policies Work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsConsAverted a full-scale depression.Created a large budget deficit and increased national debt.Stabilized the financial system.Public backlash against “bailouts” created moral hazard concerns.Restored confidence and lowered borrowing costs.The economic recovery was slow and uneven.\nOverall Judgment: The combined expansionary policies were successful in preventing a catastrophe by boosting Aggregate Demand. However, the recovery was slow, and the policies had significant drawbacks, including a massive increase in government debt.\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis (2007–2009)\n1.

Macroeconomic impact on the U.S.\n\n\nReal GDP growth\n\nDeep contraction over the recession. BEA revisions show cumulative real GDP fell about 5.1% from 2007 Q4 to 2009 Q2; the worst quarterly drops were 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1.\nNotable quarters (annualized rates, revised): 2008 Q4 around -8.9%; 2009 Q1 around -6.7%. NBER trough in June 2009, then weak expansion.\nInterpretation: Credit shock and wealth losses caused a sharp drop in consumption, investment, trade, and inventories.\n\n\n\nUnemployment\n\nUnemployment peaked at about 10.0–10.2% in late 2009 (BLS October 2009 report shows 10.2%). Payrolls fell by ~7+ million from Dec 2007 to late 2009.\nLong-term unemployment (27+ weeks) rose sharply; employment-population ratio fell to ~58.5% by Oct 2009.\nInterpretation: Businesses cut jobs rapidly amid collapsing demand, tight credit, and uncertainty.\n\n\n\nInflation (CPI)\n\nHeadline inflation flipped into year-over-year declines in parts of 2009, largely due to energy price collapse; several monthly CPI releases in 2009 show negative 12-month changes.\nCore CPI stayed positive but subdued (~1.8–1.9% YoY in early/mid 2009).\nInterpretation: Demand destruction and energy price plunge brought disinflation/temporary deflation, while core remained modest.\n\n\n\nTrade balance: Global trade fell sharply; strong dollar in late 2008 hurt exports.\n\n\nHousehold wealth: Equity and housing price collapses cut household net worth, deepening the consumption fall.\n\n\nGovernment debt: Federal deficits surged due to automatic stabilizers, rescues, and stimulus.\n\n\n3. Government and Fed responses\n\nMonetary policy (Federal Reserve)\n\nInterest rates: Fed cut the federal funds rate to near zero by Dec 2008.\nLiquidity/credit programs: New facilities to backstop markets and institutions (e.g., Term Auction Facility; support for commercial paper; interventions around Bear Stearns, AIG).\nQuantitative easing: Large-scale asset purchases to lower long-term rates and stabilize mortgage and credit markets.\nEvaluation: Pros—stabilized funding markets, reduced systemic panic, lowered borrowing costs. Cons—unconventional tools were controversial; recovery remained slow; moral hazard concerns.\n\n\nFiscal policy (Federal Government)\n\nTARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program, Oct 2008): Capital injections into banks, AIG support, later housing/auto assistance.\nARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Feb 2009): ~$787B stimulus via tax cuts, unemployment extensions, state aid, and infrastructure.\nEvaluation: Pros—reduced tail risk of financial collapse; boosted demand and confidence; aided labor market stabilization. Cons—public backlash over “bailouts”; uneven housing relief; higher federal debt; recovery slower than typical postwar rebounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crisis originated mainly from the U.S. housing market, where house prices peaked around mid-2006 followed by a sharp rise in mortgage defaults, especially among subprime borrowers who had poor credit and high default risk.\n\n\nLeading up to the crisis, there was excessive risk-taking fueled by a favorable economic environment characterized by strong growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and low interest rates. This encouraged households and investors to borrow imprudently to buy homes and flip properties for short-term profit.\n\n\nBanks and lenders increased risky lending, often without assessing borrowers’ ability to repay loans, because loans were bundled into complex mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold to investors globally. These securities were wrongly rated as low risk.\n\n\nFinancial institutions across the globe including U.S. banks and foreign banks invested heavily in these MBS products, spreading the risk internationally.\n\n\nThe collapse of the housing bubble, and rising mortgage defaults, caused the value of these securities to drop sharply, triggering a cascade of losses in banks, credit institutions, and investors worldwide, leading to a freeze in credit markets.\n\n\nOther contributing systemic factors included excessive leverage, maturity transformation problems, inadequate regulation and supervision, and interconnectedness of financial institutions.\n\n\nThe crisis escalated from a subprime mortgage problem into a worldwide financial system collapse and a severe global recession.\n\n\nRecovery was slow, with lingering high unemployment and cautious lending even after the recession technically ended in 2009. Inflation remained subdued in the years following.\n\n\nFiscal Policy:\n\n\nThe government deployed massive bailout programs, notably the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which allocated $700 billion to stabilize banks and large financial firms by purchasing toxic assets and equity stakes.\n\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included large-scale government spending aimed at preserving existing jobs, creating new employment opportunities, and stimulating economic demand.\n\n\nPros: These fiscal measures helped restore confidence in the banking system, prevented further bankruptcies, and cushioned the recession’s blow to the labor market.\n\n\nCons: The stimulus increased government debt substantially, and critics argue some funds were inefficiently used or exacerbated moral hazard by bailing out risky institutions.\n\n\nMonetary Policy:\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve rapidly cut interest rates to near zero and launched unprecedented quantitative easing programs, purchasing trillions of dollars in government and mortgage-backed securities to inject liquidity.\n\n\nThe Fed also created new lending facilities to provide credit to banks, businesses, and consumers, stabilizing key financial markets.\n\n\nPros: These actions calmed the frozen credit markets, lowered borrowing costs, and supported economic recovery.\n\n\nCons: Quantitative easing raised concerns about future inflation risks and asset bubbles, with uneven benefits across different sectors.\n\n\nOverall Evaluation:\n\n\nThe combined fiscal and monetary responses were largely effective in preventing a deeper Great Depression–style collapse and laid the foundation for recovery.\n\n\nHowever, recovery was slow with prolonged high unemployment, and the policies sparked debates on financial regulation, income inequality, and the role of government intervention.\n\n\nThe crisis spurred reforms improving banking sector resilience but also highlighted challenges in managing systemic risk and moral hazard.\n\n\n\nProject: Analysis of an Economic Event\nGroup Size: 3-4 students in a group\nOutcome: Create a Poster and deliver an in-class presentation (less than 5 minutes).

1600s and in modern times.\nR1, R2, R3 skills are needed.\n9 marks\nSource D: From the Globe Theatre website\nAudiences in Shakespeare’s Time\nBy 1600, London theatres, like the Globe, could take up to 3000 people for the most popular plays. With several theatres offering plays most afternoons, this meant between 10,000 and 20,000 people a week going to London theatres.\nHow did the audience behave?\nSome of the audience went to the theatre to be seen and admired, dressed in their best clothes. But these people were not necessarily well-behaved. Most didn’t sit and watch in silence like today. They clapped the heroes and booed the villains, and cheered the special effects. Thieves were common in the audience and sometimes fights broke out. In 1612, magistrates banned music at the end of plays at the Fortune Theatre, saying the crowd had caused ‘tumults and outrages’ with their dancing.\nWhat effect did the audience have on the success of a play?\nWith such large audiences, plays only had short runs before they were replaced. Between 1594 and 1640 about 700 new plays were written. In the past, and the crowds, these plays often re-told famous stories from myths, the lessons of violence, music and humour always popular (and the meaning was known). At the Swan Theatre if a play, the audience let the actors know. At the Swan Theatre if the audience didn’t like a play, they drowned the actors’ words with drums and whistles. In 1629, a visiting French company was booed and pelted with apples by the audience. This was because the company used women to play female roles, something which shocked the audience. Since it was so involved in the performance of a play, the audience was vital to its success.\nSource E: A newspaper journalist expresses her views on a recent trip to the theatre.\nShould We Put Up With Disruptive Behaviour At The Theatre?\nAudiences are increasingly fed up with bad behaviour in the theatre – and they are taking the law into their own hands.\nMany have applauded the actions of theatre-goer, Kevin Williamson, who reacted to another audience member’s refusal to stop using their phone during the performance by seizing it and tossing it across the theatre. Others have pointed out that this in itself created further disruption, which was disrespectful to the performers.\nIn a perfect world, nobody should have to police anybody else in the theatre. Everybody should know that using mobile phones to text is as rude as talking throughout.\nBut they don’t. There are plenty of people who seem to think that they haven’t actually experienced something unless they have photographed and videoed it – and that extends to their theatre-going.\nI’ve been to shows for under-fives where a substantial number of adults in the audience have spent the entire performance Facebooking merrily away. Theatre managers take no action, but maybe that’s because they are too busy protecting the stage from being stormed by the kids left to roam entirely free by their texting parents.\nThe situation will not improve as long as managers stand idly by. Persistent texters are allowed to type with impunity. Latecomers are admitted to seats in the middle of rows despite notices that say ‘no latecomers’. People are permitted to take lavatory breaks on a whim and are re-admitted when it suits them. And those who think the ‘no photographs’ rule doesn’t apply to them are allowed to get away with it. For as long as such leniency exists, the enjoyment of the vast majority of theatre-goers will be compromised by the rudeness of the minority.\n\nSECTION 2: Diving (Image 2)\nRefer to Source D and Source E. Compare what we learn about the dangers and the joys of diving in these sources?\nYou may refer to both Source E’s image and text within your response.\n(10 marks)\nSource D\nThe dangers of diving\nTwenty years ago, I embarked on a round-the-world trip. But, when I fell in love with scuba diving, I took a job as a cook on a dive boat on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.\nAfter two days based at the diving school, the students would board a boat for a three-day trip. It was me they came to with their worries: ‘Are there sharks on the reef?’; ‘Are they dangerous?’; ‘Is it pitch black on a night dive?’\nThat morning on the boat, two of the instructors were going on an ‘early one’, and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. They said the best time to dive was 6am, when the fish were waking and feeding on the coral, and the sun on the water was dazzling. They were planning a short, deep dive. They were two of the most experienced divers, but also two of the most competitive. I felt slightly out of my comfort zone, so I declined. I regretted it as I watched them sink beneath the surface.\nAfter such a deep dive, they should have resurfaced after 22 minutes. At 45 minutes, the remaining crew and I were anxiously scanning the water. Then somebody noticed that neither of the divers had taken their digital compasses – the instruments needed to find their way.\nAs time went by, my terror grew. We organised rescue helicopters from the mainland, while attempting to keep the potential disaster a secret from the scuba-diving students. But, after 90 minutes we had to cancel their training dive, and the leader was forced to explain the situation.\nIt wasn’t until another hour later that a passenger spotted a tiny flash of silver on the horizon. It was miles from where the divers had gone into the water. The captain went to investigate and, eventually, our divers were picked up, safe and well. Swept away by strong currents on their dive they had been unable to find the boat. The flash of silver was a watch, aimed at the sun to reflect a signal to passing boats.\nOnce back on board, they were quiet and shocked, and, while we all knew there would be a safety review by the dive company, they preferred not to speak. But I saw it in their faces: the terror of having been in the middle of the open water, small dots in a wide expanse of blue. It could have been a tragedy, but was, luckily, just a healthy reminder of the power and unpredictability of the sea and the way a flat, calm surface can mask a wild undercurrent.\nSource E\nThe reef\nThe reef was a maze of beauty and danger. It stretched out for miles, its twisted branches and rocky cracks forming a landscape, which threatened visitors with jagged razor edges and hidden poisonous creatures. But despite all its dangers, the reef was a place of safety and sanctuary for those who knew how to navigate it. Schools of fish shot through the water, their scales shimmering like jewels against the vibrant backdrop of the coral. Crabs and shrimp scuttled across the sand, while starfish clung to the coral with their suctioned feet, adding to the kaleidoscope of colours and textures that made the reef a breathtaking spectacle.\n\nSECTION 3: Natural Disasters (Image 3)\nQuestion 4: Refer to Source D and Source E. Compare what we learn about the effects of natural disasters in these sources.\n10 marks\nSource D\nEffects of Natural Disasters\nThe impact of natural disasters can be absolutely devastating and long lasting.\nWhen the earthquake struck the region, everything changed in an instant. People fled from collapsing buildings, and clouds of dust choked the air. Roads split apart. Fires broke out where gas pipes burst. Survivors stumbled around in shock, trying to find missing family members.\nEmergency services were overwhelmed. Hospitals filled within hours. Those who escaped injury still lost homes, possessions, and, in many cases, livelihoods. Entire communities were left without power or clean water.\nIn the aftermath, disease often spreads quickly in cramped temporary shelters. Children are particularly vulnerable. It can take years to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Many families are never able to return to the lives they once knew.\nThe emotional trauma is equally destructive. The fear, the grief, the sense of loss—it doesn’t vanish when the ground stops shaking.\nSource E\n‘The Wave’ by Morton Rhue (fictional account of a tsunami)\nNobody who lived through that day would ever forget it. We were in the kitchen when the roar began, louder than anything I’d ever heard. Then the water hit. It didn’t come in gentle waves like the sea usually does—it came like a wall, a monster crashing through everything in its path.\nThe house shook, the windows shattered, and we barely had time to scramble onto the roof before it was completely underwater. I remember holding onto the chimney, watching cars float by like toys. The force was unbelievable. It tore trees out of the ground like they were twigs.\nWhen the water finally pulled back, it left behind silence—and destruction. Furniture, animals, broken glass, and twisted metal were everywhere. We found neighbours on rooftops, some injured, some just stunned.\nIt took days before help arrived. The roads were gone. Phones were dead. We were completely cut off. We shared whatever food we had and tried not to cry in front of the younger kids. I think that was the hardest part—trying to be strong when inside we were all falling apart.\n\nSECTION 4: Wolves (Image 4)\nRefer to Source D and Source E. Compare what we learn about people’s attitudes towards wolves in the two sources.\n10 marks\nSource D\nExtract from a factual article\nWolves have long had a complex relationship with humans. In many parts of the world, they have been viewed with suspicion, fear and even hatred. Throughout the Middle Ages, wolves were hunted relentlessly in Europe, believed to be dangerous predators that threatened both livestock and people.\nIn more recent times, these negative views have softened. Conservationists have worked hard to educate the public about the vital role wolves play in ecosystems, particularly as apex predators that help control deer populations and maintain balance in the natural world.\nHowever, not everyone supports the reintroduction of wolves. In areas where wolves have been reintroduced, some farmers have complained of livestock attacks. There is still debate over how to balance wildlife conservation with the needs of local communities.\nSource E\nExtract from a fictional story\nI first saw the wolf just beyond the tree line. Its eyes were bright, alert, and unafraid. We stood frozen, two creatures curious about each other.\nI had grown up hearing stories about wolves—how they’d steal sheep in the night or drag off children who strayed too far from the path. But this wolf didn’t look evil or monstrous. It was beautiful. Proud. Not tame, but not threatening either.\nThe wolf didn’t move until I took a step forward. Then it turned, silent as a shadow, and disappeared into the woods. I stood for a long time, listening to the wind in the trees and wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.\nSince that day, I’ve never feared wolves. I respect them. They are wild and mysterious, but not the villains of the old stories."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Comparison/Untitled-2":{"title":"Untitled 2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Model Paragraph:\nBoth Source D and Source E explore the behaviours of theatre audiences, but they describe very different experiences in the 1600s versus modern times. In Source D, the audience at the Globe Theatre in Shakespeare’s era was lively and very involved in the performance. The text describes how they clapped, booed, and even caused “tumults and outrages” with their cheers, dancing, and sometimes even fights or theft. This level of interaction meant that the audience had a direct impact on the play’s success; if they didn’t enjoy the performance, they would “drown the actors’ words with drums and whistles” or even throw objects like apples. Source D suggests that rowdy or disruptive behaviour from the audience was common and, in some cases, even expected.\nIn contrast, Source E focuses on the modern theatre audience, where the expectation is for people to “sit and watch in silence.” Here, disruptive behaviour is seen as negative and disrespectful, particularly when people use mobile phones, arrive late, or ignore rules about photography. The source shows frustration from regular theatre-goers who feel that their experience is ruined by the rudeness of a few, indicating that the cultural norm today values quiet attention rather than active participation. The journalist complains about “persistent texters” and describes parents allowing children to be noisy, but unlike in the 1600s, these behaviours are condemned, not celebrated.\nIn summary, both sources show that disruptive or lively behaviour occurs in both time periods, but the attitude towards this behaviour has changed. In Shakespeare’s time, loud and active audiences were an essential part of the theatre experience, directly influencing the performance. In modern times, however, any disruption is considered disrespectful, and there is a clear expectation that audiences should be quiet and attentive, showing how societal values regarding theatre etiquette have changed over time."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Comparison/Untitled-3":{"title":"Untitled 3","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"**Here is a model answer for your Source Comparison assessment:\n\nComparison of attitudes towards wolves in Source D and Source E\nBoth Source D and Source E explore people’s attitudes towards wolves, but they do so in different ways and from different perspectives.\nIn Source D, which is a factual article, the attitudes towards wolves are shown to be varied and to have changed over time. The source explains that wolves were “viewed with suspicion, fear and even hatred” in the past, especially in medieval Europe, where they were seen as dangerous predators threatening “livestock and people.” This shows that, historically, people’s attitudes were very negative and based on fear, possibly due to the threat wolves posed to their livelihoods and safety. The writer also notes that wolves were “hunted relentlessly,” further demonstrating the hostility people felt.\nHowever, the article also points out that these negative views have “softened” in more modern times. Conservationists have played a role in educating people about the ecological importance of wolves, raising awareness of their value as “apex predators” that help maintain nature’s balance. Despite this increase in understanding, Source D acknowledges that opinions remain divided. While some support wolf conservation, “some farmers have complained of livestock attacks,” showing that fear and resentment still exist, especially where economic interests are involved. Overall, Source D presents people’s attitudes towards wolves as complex and shaped by changing circumstances and new knowledge.\nIn contrast, Source E is a fictional account that focuses on individual experience. The narrator grew up with the same negative stories about wolves—such as stealing sheep or even attacking children—which reflects the traditional fears mentioned in Source D. However, the narrator’s direct encounter with a wolf leads to a personal change in attitude; instead of seeing the wolf as “evil or monstrous,” the narrator describes it as “beautiful” and “proud,” and comes to feel “respect” rather than fear. The story clearly challenges the old myths and suggests that wolves are “not the villains of the old stories.” The attitude here is more sympathetic and nuanced—the narrator even finds the wolf “not threatening,” showing a shift from inherited fear to a more open-minded and appreciative view.\nIn summary, both sources acknowledge the long-standing fear and suspicion towards wolves, but Source D explores a broad, societal change over time while Source E shows a personal transformation. Source D is concerned with facts and general trends, highlighting both progress and continued divisions, whereas Source E uses a personal encounter to argue that wolves should be respected, not feared. Both suggest that attitudes towards wolves are evolving, but they illustrate this evolution in different ways.\n\nThis answer covers similarities, differences, textual details, and interpretations for a 10-mark AQA comparison.**"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Comparison/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ah, thank you for clarifying!

Source A uses two birds-eye-view images showing the before and after of development in Lagos, with the first image showing crowded roads with crowded streets and short buildings littered on the sides. While the second image shows highways and uniform roads surrounded with districts of tall buildings as far as the eye can see. The camera angles of the images reinforced the development of Lagos, with the first image’s angle positioned in a way that the short buildings blocks a lot of the view of the rest of the city, only showing a small portion of the city, while the second image is very high, showing the wide expanse of the newly expanded city. Source B shows the development by starting off with short, declarative sentences, “A city that’s always changing. A place still being built.”, indicating that Lagos is still developing and it is doing so fast, without stopping. Source B emphasizes the rapid positive change by informing that “Twenty million years ago, Lekki was mostly swamp, but now homes there sell for millions” and “A street you saw six months ago might look different now”, using time followed by the changes to emphasize how much development has happened over the months.\nHowever, Source B is a bit skeptical about the unnatural speed of development and decision making for development, while Source A seems to show it in a positive manner. Source B mentions that “it may be risking careful planning or long-lasting stability”, suggesting that this impulsive or erratical way of city planning and development might be unseen before and never tried before, therefore might lead to problems way down the road and cause more harm than benefits. Source B also gives a specific example of an area of concern, “Eko Atlantic City, built on land taken from the ocean. But I still feel unsure. I keep imagining the sea one day coming back to take it all away”, the use of the author’s own opinion with the personification of the sea coming back to destroy the hard work of the Lagos people paints a vivid picture of the risks that the city may face in the future, raising concerns about the sustainability of the rapid development. On the other hand, Source A’s images show a before and after effect, and the after image does not show anything bad, instead it shows fluffy clouds and clear skies over the more organized and clean city. Overall, Source A presents the development in a positive manner, while Source B commemorates and praises the development, but shows some skepticism and concerns about the development. Source B seems to implore the readers to think or raise awareness of the fact that sometimes if deterministic people go too far they might miss important details.\nSource A presents before as crowded, under developed, messy districts and now…\nSource B shows Lagos wants to improve, lots of shops, able to develop, good economics?\n\nComparison: How Lagos is Presented in Source A and Source B\nSource A: Textual Representation\nSource A presents Lagos as a city of constant transformation and uncertainty. The opening declarative sentence “A city that’s always changing” immediately establishes Lagos as dynamic and unstable. The writer uses present tense throughout, creating immediacy and suggesting this change is ongoing and relentless.\nKey aspects of presentation:\n\nRapid development: The metaphor of houses that “pop up” suggests sudden, almost magical appearance of new buildings\nImpermanence: The contrast between what “you saw just six months ago” and “now” emphasizes the city’s transient nature\nCommercial dynamism: The specific example of shops transforming from “fashion boutique” to “furniture store” shows economic fluidity\nGeographical transformation: The description of land “taken back from the sea” presents Lagos as literally reshaping itself against nature\n\nThe tone becomes increasingly concerned and skeptical toward the end, with phrases like “fast, restless, and never satisfied” suggesting criticism of unchecked growth. The final image of the sea “coming back to take it all away” creates an ominous sense of environmental vulnerability.\nSource B: Visual Representation\nThe two images present contrasting visual perspectives of Lagos:\nTop image: Shows Lagos as a bustling, crowded commercial hub with:\n\nDense crowds suggesting vibrant street life\nTraditional market structures alongside modern buildings\nHuman-scale perspective emphasizing the city’s energy and activity\nBlack and white presentation giving a timeless, documentary quality\n\nBottom image: Presents Lagos as a modern, expansive metropolis with:\n\nAerial perspective showing urban sprawl and development\nModern high-rise buildings suggesting prosperity and growth\nOrderly infrastructure and planned development\nBroader scope emphasizing the city’s scale and ambition\n\nComparative Analysis\nSimilarities:\n\nBoth sources emphasize Lagos’s developmental energy and growth\nBoth suggest a city of contrasts - old and new, traditional and modern\nBoth present Lagos as significant and noteworthy - worthy of documentation\n\nKey Differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspectSource ASource BToneAnxious, uncertain, criticalNeutral, documentary, observationalPerspectivePersonal, experiential (“you saw”)Objective, distancedTime focusTemporal change over months/yearsStatic moments capturedConcernsEnvironmental risks, sustainabilityVisual documentation without judgmentDetail levelSpecific examples (shops, furniture)Broad urban landscapes\nMost significantly, Source A presents Lagos through a narrative of concern about rapid, potentially unsustainable development, while Source B offers visual evidence of Lagos as a functioning, dynamic urban center without explicit commentary on the implications of this development.\nThe text creates emotional engagement through personal observation and worry, while the images provide empirical evidence of Lagos’s urban reality, allowing readers to form their own judgments about the city’s development trajectory.\n\nInferences\nSource A suggests an insider’s perspective - someone living in or frequently visiting Lagos. The use of “you saw” and specific local knowledge (Admiralty Road, Lekki, The Island) implies personal experience and emotional investment in the city’s future. This creates authenticity but also subjective anxiety about change.\nSource B implies an outsider’s documentation - likely journalistic or academic photography intended to objectively record urban conditions. The formal, archival quality suggests these images serve as evidence or illustration rather than personal expression.\nEnvironmental justice concerns can be inferred from Source A’s emphasis on land reclamation and the ominous prediction about the sea returning. This suggests Lagos’s development may be environmentally unsustainable and disproportionately risky for vulnerable populations.\nSource A implies accelerating change - the specific timeframe (“six months ago”, “twenty years ago”) suggests development is outpacing human adaptation. The reference to “swamp” being transformed into million-dollar properties indicates massive environmental manipulation for economic gain.\nSource B captures a moment of transition - the coexistence of traditional market structures with modern buildings suggests Lagos is simultaneously preserving and transforming its urban character.\nSource A’s Dubai comparison implies Lagos is following international development models rather than creating indigenous urban solutions. This suggests globalized urban planning that may not suit local conditions.\nThe environmental vulnerability mentioned (sea reclamation, climate concerns) positions Lagos within global climate change discourse - as both contributor to and victim of environmental challenges.\nBoth sources together suggest Lagos represents broader African urban challenges:\n\nRapid growth outpacing infrastructure\nTension between economic opportunity and environmental sustainability\nGlobal investment models conflicting with local needs\nThe need for development approaches that balance growth with stability\n\n\n\nBoth sources present surfing as a dangerous activity, but they approach this theme in distinctly different ways.\nSource A presents surfing romantically and atmospherically. The writer uses sensory imagery to create an immersive scene: “The air smells a little like salt water, but much more like bonfires, diesel, and weed.” This establishes surfing within a broader cultural context, suggesting it’s part of a lifestyle and community. The danger is presented as alluring and legendary - “some of the world’s biggest waves” and waves that “can reach 100 feet tall.” The language emphasizes the epic scale and prestige of surfing at Mavericks, with phrases like “massive waves” and describing surfers who have “died here.” This romanticizes the risk, presenting it as heroic rather than simply hazardous.\nIn contrast, Source B presents surfing in a practical, safety-focused manner. The danger is presented factually and clinically: “Surfing comes with risks, like any sport.” The tone is instructional rather than atmospheric, using direct warnings like “You could drown if a big wave holds you underwater.” Where Source A glamorizes the danger, Source B systematically lists hazards with clear explanations and safety advice: “stay calm, float with the current, then swim sideways toward the waves and back to shore.”\nThe purposes differ significantly. Source A appears to be creative non-fiction that captures the culture and mystique of big wave surfing, using evocative description like “shadowy people sit quietly in the backs of pickup trucks.” Source B is clearly educational, designed to inform surfers about safety: “not to scare you, but to raise awareness.”\nKey inferences can be drawn from both sources. Source A implies that surfing at this level is exclusive and elite - the reference to “Even skilled, well-known surfers have died here” suggests only experienced professionals attempt these waves. The early morning setting and “waiting for a surf competition to start” infers this is a serious, organized sport rather than casual recreation. The unpredictability described (“Just one shift in wind or tide can ruin everything”) implies that surfers must be completely dedicated and flexible.\nSource B infers that surfing has become more mainstream and accessible, requiring safety education for a broader audience. The phrase “Some may not apply to your local beach” suggests surfing is now practiced widely across different locations and skill levels. The reassuring tone (“surfing is still a safe and healthy activity”) infers there’s public concern about surfing’s dangers that needs addressing.\nThe language choices reflect these different purposes. Source A uses literary techniques like metaphor (“steep, deep underwater rock formation”) and creates suspense through uncertainty (“even then, the schedule can change suddenly”). Source B employs straightforward, accessible language with practical imperatives: “Just stay alert, use good judgment.”\nWhile both sources acknowledge surfing’s inherent dangers, Source A presents it as a thrilling, almost mystical pursuit worth the risk, whereas Source B presents it as a manageable activity where risks can be minimized through knowledge and preparation.\n\n\nAQA Comparison Analysis: How Computing is Presented in Sources A and B\nKey Contrasts in Presentation\nEducational Philosophy\n\nSource A: Presents computing as a comprehensive academic subject requiring systematic curriculum coverage from ages 5-16+, emphasizing theoretical foundations (algorithms, digital data, computer science concepts)\nSource B: Presents computing as practical workplace skills with immediate economic value, focusing on industry applications (programming, software development, gaming industry)\n\nPrimary Appeal and Motivation\n\nSource A: Appeals to educational completeness - “has something for all Key Stages” and expert-designed content, positioning computing as essential curriculum knowledge\nSource B: Appeals to career prospects - “valued in almost all workplaces” and “valuable skill to have when leaving school,” positioning computing as economic investment\n\nApproach to Engagement\n\nSource A: Uses gamification as learning methodology (Dance Mat Typing) to make skill acquisition enjoyable while maintaining educational structure\nSource B: Promotes games as pedagogical tools to improve “exam results” and make lessons “enjoyable and engaging,” treating games as means to academic ends\n\nTemporal Focus\n\nSource A: Long-term educational journey from early childhood through final exams, suggesting computing as part of intellectual development\nSource B: Immediate practical application and future career preparation, emphasizing computing’s economic utility\n\nKey Inferences\nDual Identity of Computing Education\nThese sources reveal computing education’s position at the intersection of traditional academic subjects and vocational training. This reflects broader tensions about whether computing should be taught as theoretical discipline or practical skill set.\nAudience-Driven Messaging\nThe contrasting presentations suggest computing education must simultaneously serve multiple stakeholders: students seeking knowledge, parents wanting curriculum coverage, and society demanding workplace-ready graduates.\nEvolution of Educational Priorities\nThe shift from Source A’s curriculum-focused approach to Source B’s career-focused approach may reflect changing educational priorities in response to technological advancement and economic demands.\nGamification as Universal Strategy\nBoth sources employ gaming elements, suggesting this pedagogical approach transcends different educational philosophies, serving both engagement and skill development across varying contexts.\n\n\n"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/For-AI-Speech":{"title":"For AI Speech","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"(look around, pause)\nImagine this: a student spends more than 70% of their young life in school—collaborating with friends, showing creativity in projects, working hard.\nAnd yet, on exam day, all of that learning is reduced… to a single number on a piece of paper.\nDoes that really sound fair?

Throughout the poem, Hughes chooses to use words such as ‘crashing’, ‘stampeding’, ‘wielded’, ‘flexing’, ‘strained’, ‘flung’, and ‘bent’ to clearly show readers how violent the wind is. This semantic field is reinforced by the consonance used in the fourth stanza, where the wind made a “black-back gull bent like an iron bar slowly”. The consonance of ‘b’, ‘g’, and ‘s’ in this sentence not only mimics the harshness of the wind’s assault on the gull, but also slows the reading pace, allowing readers to feel the strain and pain experienced by the gull in vain. This auditory ugliness, combined with the literal meaning and vivid imagery, evokes a sense of sympathy for the gull while conveying to us the brutal and ferocious force of the wind. This exploration can also reflect Ted Hughe’s personal life, where his troubled marriage with Sylvia Plath was a road of struggles with mental health and eventual suicide. The brutal power of the wind in the poem may symbolize the emotional turmoil and instability in their relationship, where some stuff seemed beyond human control. Through this use of diction and sounds, Hughes effectively presents nature’s violent power.\nMoreover, Hughes also presents the wind as unpredictable by using the structure and form of the poem. Upon first glance, the poem seems to have a regular structure of quatrains throughout the whole poem. But when you read it, there is a lot of enjambment and the structured quatrains now seem not so structured after all. The last sentences of each stanza always bleeds into the next stanza. The flowing of lines across stanzas resemble the wind’s persistence and force, as if even the poem cannot contain it. This uniform but also not so regular structure symbolizes the deceptiveness of nature and its capacity for sudden violence. Through this clever poem structuring, Hughes effectively conveys nature’s unpredictability, reminding us that nature’s power can transcend human understanding, showing us our vulnerability.\n‘Storm on the island’ also similarly presents nature as unpredictable. Heaney uses the simile of the wind being a ‘tame cat turned savage’ to encapsulate nature’s duality: what seemed like to be ‘tame’ and friendly like a cat, out of nowhere, turned ‘savage’ and starts ‘spitting’. This  reflects how nature betrays normal human expectations. Moreover, ‘turned savage’ is enjambed onto the next line, this slows down the pace of reading this sentence and allowing readers to dwell on it abruptness.\nSimilarly, ‘Storm on the Island’ also presents nature as powerful. Seamus Heaney also uses a semantic field and oxymoron to deliver and convey the wind’s power. ‘dives’, ‘strafes’, ‘salvo’, ‘bombarded’ and ‘exploding’ are all words that are related to violence and more specifically, war, to invoke a sense of ferocity and violence. This is also reinforced by the oxymoron ‘exploding comfortably’. The wind is able to ‘explode’ something, juxtaposing a contrast between the words ‘exploding’ and ‘comfortably’, breaking the islander’s sense of safety. By using these literary devices, Heaney undermines any notion of safety, highlighting how nature can obliterate the human defenses both psychologically and physically. This storm and wind can also symbolize the political chaos and instability experienced by Heaney in Ireland during ‘The Troubles’. Written in the mid-20th century, the poem reflects the violent conflict in Ireland. The wind, unpredictable and unrelenting, mirrors the social and political situation at that time, where everyone is harmed by fellow humans. Even far away if you are on an island far from the main land, even if you are not involved, the wind can still fling the spray from the ocean and ‘spit’ on your windows. Using this symbolism, Heaney tries to show how political chaos have the power to reach and affect everyone, even if they don’t know what is going on."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Poetry/The-Road-Not-Taken":{"title":"The Road Not Taken","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Imagery\n“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood” immediately paints a picture of an autumn setting. This use of imagery evokes a sense of the passage of time, setting off and enhancing the theme of choices and their effect after you make them.\nSymbolism\nThe “two roads” in “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood” symbolize life choices, representing how going down a different path might be totally different and the divergent paths that one faces in life. The decision to go down one over the other reflects the significance of the choices one make and how they shape one’s future.\nMood\nThe mood presented in “I shall be telling this with a sigh” is one of reflection and contemplation as the speaker reflects on their choice with a ‘sigh’, whether relief or regret. This contributes to the overall reflective and bittersweet tone of the poem, promoting thinking and reflection of ones choices and their consequences.\ncontrast - complexity of decisions may not be what they initially seem\nJuxtaposition\n“Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same”\nThis line creates a juxtaposition between the initial perception of the two roads as being different and the realization after observing them that they are similar. This highlights the ambiguity, uncertainty, and unpredictability of choices.\nAmbiguity\nThe author reflects at the end and comes up that his choice “has made all the difference”. We do not know whether that difference is good or bad. This reinforces the theme of uncertainty of choices and their consequences.\nFirst Person POV\n“I took the one less traveled by”\nThis makes the poem more personal to the author and intimate with their experience.

In the poems, Hardy disguises some place names as was his habit, although others remain as they were. St. Juliot and Beeny Cliff are real places near Boscastle. Castle Boterel refers to Boscastle itself, while Lyonesse is the name of the mythical land of ancient Cornwall.

The “tropic heat” that “oozed up from the ground” with “sharp odours” creates a sense of alien hostility, while the “snow-clouds of elder-blossom” with their “sweet and giddy suffocation” suggests how the unfamiliar environment assaults his senses. This sensory overload reflects his emotional distress at being lost.\nThe writer then deepens the boy’s isolation through repetition and escalating tension. The phrase “For the first time in my life” is repeated to emphasize the unprecedented nature of his solitude, while the description of being “in a world whose behaviour I could neither predict nor fathom” conveys his profound vulnerability. His primal response of putting back his head and howling demonstrates raw emotional terror, with the simile of the sun hitting him “like a bully” reinforcing his feelings of victimization by his environment.\nThe phrase “daylight nightmare” effectively captures his emotional state, bridging his terrifying experience with the comfort of rescue. The writer presents his sisters’ arrival through transformative imagery - their faces are described as “shields between me and the sky,” positioning them as protectors. The metaphor of them appearing “like genii” with their “broad scoldings and affection” shows how their familiar presence dispels his fear, while their “hands dripping with juice” and faces “smeared with red currants” present a comforting return to the ordinary, childish world.\nThe sisters’ dialogue at the end, with its colloquial “Come down ‘ome,” completes his emotional journey by restoring normalcy and security. Their matter-of-fact offer to “stuff you with currants” transforms his frightening adventure into a simple childhood incident, demonstrating how quickly terror can dissolve into comfort when surrounded by family.\nThrough this progression from disorientation to rescue, the writer effectively conveys not just the boy’s immediate feelings but a deeper truth about childhood - how quickly the world can shift from terrifying to secure, and how the presence of loved ones can transform a “daylight nightmare” into merely another adventure.\n\nfeedback\nThat’s a strong and clear plan — especially for building a structured, conceptual response. Let’s break down how this approach would align with the top-level AOs (Assessment Objectives) for the Oxford AQA International GCSE English Literature (9275), and how you could sharpen it further.\n\n✍️ Your Structure:\nParagraph 1: Discomfort and unfamiliarity\n\nTechnique focus: imagery and simile\n\n🔍 Comment: Excellent place to start — you’re grounding the essay in the initial tone and setting. This allows you to explore:\n\n\nSensory imagery: “tropic heat,” “oozed,” “sharp odours,” “snow-clouds of elder-blossom”\n\n\nSimile: The sun hitting him “like a bully”\n\n\n🧠 AO2 Strength: You’ll score highly if you don’t just name these, but explore their emotional and atmospheric effects. How does the simile intensify his sense of alienation?\n💡 Pro Tip: Connect to AO1 by linking the discomfort to broader themes of childhood vulnerability or the unfamiliar natural world.\n\nParagraph 2: Fear and helplessness\n\nTechnique focus: repetition and oxymoron\n\n🔍 Comment: This is a perfect midpoint. You’re escalating the emotional journey by focusing on:\n\n\nRepetition: “For the first time in my life” (emphasising novelty and isolation)\n\n\nOxymoron: “daylight nightmare” (blending the familiar and the terrifying)\n\n\n🧠 AO2 Strength: These devices show how the writer intensifies emotional conflict — a key Level 6 move.\n💡 Pro Tip: Briefly consider structure — the shift from sensation to psychological overwhelm — to hit all aspects of AO2.\n\nParagraph 3: Relief and safety\n\nTechnique focus: contrast in character description and dialogue\n\n🔍 Comment: This contrast is vital — and using dialogue and character description shows a nuanced engagement with writer’s methods.\n\n\nDialogue like “Come down ‘ome” → natural, grounding, restores safety\n\n\nVisuals of “hands dripping with juice” and “faces smeared with red currants” → tactile, familiar, comforting\n\n\n🧠 AO2 Strength: This paragraph lets you explore how dialogue, action, and metaphor work together to dissolve the nightmare.\n💡 Pro Tip: Comment on narrative focus — how the writer shifts the gaze away from the boy and onto his sisters — this can be read as symbolic of safety: he no longer needs to narrate his distress, they take over.\n\n🎯 Overall Strengths of Your Plan:\n✅ Chronological = natural structure\n✅ Thematic progression = strong AO1 engagement\n✅ Focused on specific writer’s methods = high AO2 potential\n✅ Clear arc of emotional development = lets you explore character and perspective with depth (AO3)\n\n🧠 Stretch Suggestions:\nTo hit Level 6 consistently:\n\n\nIntroduce a moment of alternative interpretation once per paragraph — even if just briefly.\n\nE.g., “The simile ‘like a bully’ could also imply that the environment is not just hostile, but overwhelming in a specifically personal way, reflecting a child’s fear of punishment or abandonment.”\n\n\n\nLink each paragraph to a broader idea about childhood, memory, or family — this helps meet AO1’s call for “themes/ideas/perspectives.”\n\n\n\n🏁 Final Thoughts:\nThis 3-part plan is not just solid — it’s flexible enough for timed writing and it targets all three AOs with clarity. If executed well, it’s easily Level 5 to Level 6 territory, and could score in the 25–30 range with depth and polish.\n\nThat’s a brilliant insight — and very common at this level. You’re clearly thinking at a top-band level, but the challenge is verbalising those ideas quickly and clearly in timed conditions.\nHere’s how to bridge the gap between your sophisticated thinking and exam-time expression:\n\n🔁 1. \nUse Flexible Sentence Starters\nTo get those deeper insights out fast, pre-learn sentence structures you can plug ideas into under pressure.\n🎓 Stretch Sentence Starters:\n\n\n“This suggests not only ___, but also hints at ___.”\n\n\n“The writer could be showing ___ on the surface, yet there is a deeper sense of ___.”\n\n\n“An alternative reading might be that ___.”\n\n\n“This shift in focus from ___ to ___ highlights ___.”\n\n\n“The technique also invites the reader to consider ___.”\n\n\n🧠 Example:\n\n“The oxymoron ‘daylight nightmare’ not only captures the surreal intensity of the boy’s fear, but also hints at how even familiar environments can feel threatening in moments of emotional overwhelm.”\n\nWrite these out with blanks and practice plugging in your ideas during revision. They act like scaffolding for complex ideas.\n\n🧱 2. \nBuild a Short Bank of Ready-Made Phrases\nHave 6–10 “analytical building blocks” you can reuse. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeaUseful PhraseContrast“creates a jarring contrast between ___ and ___”Structure shift“marks a turning point in the emotional tone of the passage”Reader response“guides the reader toward a feeling of ___”Symbolic description“may symbolise ___, reinforcing the theme of ___”Voice and perspective“focuses the narrative lens on ___, which highlights ___”\nUse them as go-to tools to frame your deeper thinking even when you’re under time pressure.\n\n⏱ 3. \nPractice Verbalising Thought → Speech → Writing\nThis sounds weird but saying your analysis out loud before writing helps:\n\n\nPick a sentence (e.g. “like a bully”) and say out loud:\n\n“Okay, this simile compares the sun to a bully, which shows the environment feels threatening, almost personally aggressive, like a bully would be.”\n\n\n\nNow write that exact thing down. You’ll surprise yourself — it’s often easier to speak complex ideas than to write them first. Practise this a few times before your next timed essay.\n\n🧠 4. \nHave an AO2 Toolkit Ready (Not Just Technique Names)\nDon’t just think “simile = check.” Instead, prepare a mental effects menu:\n\n\nSimile → shows unfamiliarity, exaggerates danger, makes abstract emotion visual\n\n\nRepetition → heightens panic, shows obsessive thought, isolates a key idea\n\n\nDialogue → grounds the character, reveals tone, shifts emotional atmosphere\n\n\nNarrative shift → changes reader alignment, builds contrast, creates relief/tension\n\n\nWhen you see a technique, ask: what is this doing to the reader, or to the emotional tone?\n\n✍️ 5. \nFlashwrite With Limits\nPractice writing only three sentences per paragraph:\n\n\nSentence 1: Technique + quote + surface effect\n\n\nSentence 2: Deeper effect or alternative interpretation\n\n\nSentence 3: Link to theme or reader response\n\n\n⏱ Try writing one such mini-paragraph per day. You’ll build speed, confidence, and fluency in turning deep thoughts into crisp analysis.\n\n📘 In Summary:\nYou’re already noticing the right things. The trick is:\n\n\nPre-loading some flexible phrases and structures\n\n\nPractising the translation of thought → words under pressure\n\n\nUsing short, regular drills to build fluency\n\n\nWould it help if I created a printable one-page sheet with sentence frames and analysis templates you can revise from?\n\n\nThe writer uses imagery and precise physical descriptions to paint a picture of a lethal dragon. The dragon is described as having ‘sharp’ white fangs, ‘spikes ran down the creature’s spine from its head to the tip of its tail’, ‘pointed teeth’, ‘triangular head’, and ‘hard, ice blue eyes’. Sharp fangs and spikes running the whole length of this baby dragon’s body gives us an impression of its hard, lethal body features, making readers feel that if you get too close, you can get scraped or cut. The dictions of ‘hard’ and ‘ice blue’ have connotations of being cold, menacing, and a disregard of other living beings. The dragon’s body that it is born with features a menacing and able to cause harm look, indicating how dragons are born lethal.\nThe writer also uses the characters’ actions to describe the dragon. When ‘Eragon shifted slightly’, ‘the dragon’s head snapped around.’, telling us a slight movement would trigger the dragon’s attention and how fast its reaction speed is. The writer uses the word ‘formidable’ to reinforce the lethalness of the dragon, it being still a young and small creature, it still already is a challenge to take on by a grown human. When Eragon sits next to it, he had to ‘s(i)t cautiously’, when the dragon touched him slightly, ‘he jerked back’, showing how Eragon is also alert when the dragon is by him and is scared it might do something to him. By describing the first few interactions of Eragon with the dragon, the writer shows how uneasy it is to sit beside this dangerous creature.\nHowever, the dragon can also be comforting and cute, the writer shows us this by using a simile. The dragon ‘nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat’, comparing the dragon to a domesticated house cat, indicating its gentle and affectionate nature despite its fearsome appearance. The verb ‘nuzzled’ reinforces the dragon’s tenderness of using soft physical touch to seek human attention and affection.\nFurthermore, through contrasting with previous interactions and with juxtaposing the dragon’s characteristics, the writer shows that even though the dragon possesses dangerous physical features, it is capable of showing warmth and affection like a familiar pet. The author juxtaposes threatening features of ‘sharp’ fangs, ‘formidable enemy’ with vulnerable qualities ‘squealing’, ‘awkwardly explored’. The vulnerable qualities relates to small creatures that are innocent, vulnerable, and newly born. Through maintaining the dangerous nature but also revealing the heart warming gentleness and connection with Eragon, the writer crafts a nuanced portrayal of the dragon that behaves and interacts beyond the usual stereotypes of dragons as purely dangerous, suggesting both its wild, dangerous nature, capacity for companionship, and complexity as a creature.\n\nFeedback and shi\n\nPaolini crafts a complex portrayal of the dragon through skillful use of language techniques, moving from precise physical description to behavioral characteristics that challenge traditional dragon stereotypes. The writer initially establishes the dragon’s threatening nature through carefully chosen descriptive language. The physical description combines precise anatomical detail with threatening imagery: “Two diminutive white fangs curved down out of its upper jaw” and “spikes ran down the creature’s spine.” The adjective “sharp” and the imagery of “polished ivory” claws create an impression of lethal potential, while technical terminology like “triangular” head and “serrated” claws lends scientific authority to the description. Particularly effective is the writer’s use of cold imagery in “hard, ice blue eyes,” where the harsh consonants and temperature associations reinforce the dragon’s potentially dangerous nature.\nThe writer’s mastery of syntax and pacing intensifies the tension through careful language manipulation. Short, sharp sentences (“He kept very still”) create moments of suspense, while longer, detailed sentences allow for elaborate description. This rhythmic variation mirrors the dragon’s unpredictable nature. The writer also employs dynamic verbs strategically - “snapped around,” “fixed on him” - to convey the creature’s swift, predatory movements, building a sense of potential threat. The descriptive focus moves purposefully from external to intimate observation, with initial passages emphasizing visual details and physical structure, while later descriptions incorporate touch, movement, and emotional response.\nHowever, Paolini skillfully transitions to reveal the dragon’s gentler aspects through contrasting language choices. The shift begins with sound imagery: the dragon “squealing” and “squeaking,” where the softer sounds suggest vulnerability. A pivotal simile compares its mouth to “a young bird’s,” deliberately evoking images of helplessness rather than threat. This transformation continues through tactile descriptions: “felt like old parchment, velvety and warm,” where the sensory detail creates intimacy and warmth, contrasting sharply with the earlier cold imagery. The writer employs dual characterization through parallel descriptions, maintaining the dragon’s inherent dangerous features (“formidable enemy”) while simultaneously revealing its endearing qualities through behavioral descriptions (“awkwardly explored,” “nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat”).\nThrough this careful orchestration of language techniques - from precise diction to contrasting imagery, from varied syntax to sensory progression - the writer transforms our understanding of the dragon. This sensory progression mirrors Eragon’s growing understanding of the creature, particularly effective in the final description of “hundreds of slender veins” pulsing through the wing membranes, suggesting life, warmth, and vulnerability beneath the fearsome exterior. The description challenges conventional dragon mythology by creating a creature that is simultaneously dangerous and endearing, wild and affectionate, maintaining its fearsome aspects while revealing its capacity for connection and gentleness. The progression from “jerked back” to comfortable physical contact traces the development of trust between dragon and human, ultimately presenting a nuanced portrait where threatening and gentle characteristics coexist.\n\nrevised\n\nPaolini crafts a portrayal of a lethal dragon through the use language techniques, moving from precise physical description to behavioral characteristics.

The nettles are described as “the vanguard of the army,” suggesting an organized assault, while plants are portrayed as “sentinels” guarding their conquered territory. This military metaphor creates an unsettling sense that the garden is being systematically overtaken by hostile forces.\nSecond, the language of forced and unnatural unions creates a disturbing undertone. The rhododendrons have “entered into alien marriage” with “poor, bastard things,” while a lilac has “mated with a copper beech.” The word choice “alien” and “bastard” suggests something unnatural and wrong about these combinations. This is reinforced by the “malevolent ivy” that has “thrown her tendrils” around plants to make them “prisoners,” evoking images of captivity and forced bondage.\nThird, the writer employs words associated with decay and degradation to create an atmosphere of corruption. Plants are described as “vulgar and lanky” with “crumpled heads and listless stems.” The repeated use of words suggesting deformity and deterioration (“twisted,” “entwined,” “sprawled”) creates a sense of the garden’s descent into a grotesque state. The description of the “ugly form like a giant rhubarb” thrusting towards where daffodils once grew creates a particularly sinister image of beautiful things being replaced by monstrous ones.\nThe creepy atmosphere culminates in the narrator’s strange reaction to this scene. Rather than being repelled, they walk “enchanted” through this disturbing landscape, suggesting they too have fallen under the spell of this malevolent transformation. This final detail adds a psychological element to the creepiness, implying that the corruption of the garden might also represent a corruption of the human mind.\n\n\nBurnett presents Mary Lennox as a spoiled, selfish child through a range of descriptions. Mary is described as having a ‘sour expression’, been given ‘her own way in everything’, and ‘tyrannical’. These descriptions create a vivid image of a child who gets everything they want, the diction of ‘tyrannical’ reinforced this idea by comparing the child to a dictator with an iron fist. Furthermore, ‘Mary never remembered seeing anything but her Ayah and the other servants’, possibly suggesting that Mary does not care about the people around her, and only care about her servants that obey her.\nMary Lennox is also described as an isolated child. Mary ‘was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle’, with a father that ‘had always been busy’, and a mother that ‘had not wanted a little girl at all’. The range of descriptions of her familial relations paints a picture of a neglected child that has no attention from her true parents and had been sent away to a big house that might have nothing inside to provide the paternal or maternal needs or figures she requires. Moreover, the repeated use of ‘she was kept out of the way’ suggests that Mary was seen as a mistake or undesired aspect of her parent’s lives, further emphasizing how isolated and neglected she is. The previously mentioned ‘Mary never remembered seeing anything but her Ayah and the other servants’ can also suggest that she does not meet a lot of people that often, therefore resulting in a lack of true human connection and normal friendships. Overall, from these descriptions of Mary’s life and relations, readers can see that Mary is a lonely child, and can emphasize with her isolation and provide one possible reason to why she is spoiled.\nThe author also presents Mary as a deterministic child. When each English teacher ‘went away sooner than the first one’, she still orders more to come to continue learning, showing her mindset and yearn to get what she wants and to learn knowledge. The narrator agrees with this by stating ‘So if Mary had not chosen to want to learn how to read books, she might never have learned her letters at all’, suggesting that Mary is determined to learn how to read, and will not stop until she achieves her goal.\nAreas for Improvement\nMisreading in Final Paragraph: Your interpretation of Mary as “deterministic” misses the text’s meaning. The passage suggests Mary’s education was entirely dependent on her whims - she learned to read only because she happened to want to, not because of determination. The conditional “if Mary had not chosen to want to learn” emphasizes the randomness, not her determination.\nLimited Technical Vocabulary: While your analysis is sound, you could enhance it with more sophisticated literary terminology (narrative perspective, characterization techniques, dramatic irony, etc.).\nSentence Construction: Some sentences are overly long and unclear. For example: “The previously mentioned ‘Mary never remembered seeing anything but her Ayah and the other servants’ can also suggest that she does not meet a lot of people that often, therefore resulting in a lack of true human connection and normal friendships.”\nMissed Opportunities: You could explore:\n\nThe significance of the colonial Indian setting\nHow the narrator’s tone shifts from critical to sympathetic\nThe progressive structure showing Mary’s deterioration over time\nThe irony in her privileged yet neglected position\n\n\nBurnett immediately establishes Mary as profoundly unappealing through stark, unflattering description. The opening assertion that “everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen” creates an almost folkloric sense of universal rejection. The repetitive use of “thin” emphasizes her physical frailty, while the description of her “sour expression” and “yellow” coloring suggests both illness and unpleasantness. This harsh opening creates dramatic impact but also establishes Mary as an underdog worthy of sympathy.\nBurnett systematically deconstructs Mary’s family situation to explain her character defects. Her father is presented as absent and self-absorbed (“always been busy and ill himself”), while her mother is depicted as vain and neglectful (“cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people”). The stark statement that “She had not wanted a little girl at all” reveals the fundamental rejection that has shaped Mary’s personality.\nThe description of her failed education reveals both Mary’s willfulness and her isolation. Multiple governesses abandon her, suggesting her difficult nature, but the phrase “So if Mary had not chosen to want to learn how to read books, she might never have learned her letters at all” demonstrates that her education depends entirely on her whims - highlighting the absence of proper guidance and structure.\nBurnett’s language becomes increasingly sympathetic as the extract progresses. While opening with harsh judgment, phrases like “kept out of sight as much as possible” and “kept out of the way” emphasize Mary’s rejection and abandonment rather than her failings. The final conditional statement about her literacy creates sympathy by showing how her development has been left entirely to chance.\nThe third-person omniscient narrator adopts a tone that is simultaneously critical and explanatory. While the narrator doesn’t excuse Mary’s behavior, they provide crucial context that explains her character flaws. The phrase “It was true, too” confirms the harsh judgment but signals that deeper explanation will follow, creating a balanced perspective that neither condemns nor excuses.\nThe colonial setting adds another layer of dysfunction. Mary’s upbringing by “an Ayah” in India, where servants “always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything,” explains her tyrannical behavior as a product of inappropriate power dynamics rather than inherent evil.\n\nrevised\nBurnett presents Mary Lennox as a profoundly spoiled and tyrannical child whose behavior stems from systematic neglect and inappropriate power dynamics. Mary is described as having a “sour expression” and being “tyrannical and selfish,” with the diction of “tyrannical” comparing the child to a dictator with absolute power. The text reveals that servants “always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything,” creating a child accustomed to unchallenged authority. However, Burnett simultaneously provides sympathetic context through the brutal honesty that “everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen” - the universal rejection implicit in “everybody said” suggests Mary’s unpleasantness is both genuine and pitiable. The repetitive description of her as “thin” and “yellow” emphasizes her physical frailty, making her tyrannical behavior seem more like the desperate control-seeking of a powerless child than genuine malice.\nMary’s isolation forms the emotional core of her characterization, with Burnett systematically revealing the abandonment that has shaped her personality. She “was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle” after experiencing profound parental rejection - her father “had always been busy and ill himself” while her mother “had not wanted a little girl at all.” The repeated phrase “she was kept out of the way” emphasizes how Mary was treated as an unwanted burden rather than a beloved child. Furthermore, “Mary never remembered seeing anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants,” suggesting she lacks meaningful human connections beyond those obligated to serve her. This isolation explains her inability to form normal relationships and her dependence on subservient figures who cannot provide genuine emotional guidance or boundaries.\nThe colonial Indian setting adds crucial context to Mary’s character development, while Burnett’s narrative technique shifts from critical to increasingly sympathetic. The power dynamics of colonial India, where a white child holds authority over adult servants, created an unnatural environment that corrupted Mary’s development from infancy. Her education reflects this dysfunction - multiple English governesses “went away sooner than the first one” because they “disliked her so much,” yet her learning depends entirely on her whims. The conditional statement “So if Mary had not chosen to want to learn how to read books, she might never have learned her letters at all” reveals the randomness of her development rather than determination, emphasizing how her upbringing lacked proper structure or guidance. Through this carefully structured revelation, Burnett transforms initial revulsion into understanding, presenting Mary as a product of colonial privilege and systematic failure rather than inherent wickedness, establishing her as a character whose flaws are comprehensible and potentially redeemable.\n\n\nThe writer uses dynamic verbs and actions to show Bertha’s barely contained physical energy. She “wanted to run instead of walk, to take dancing steps on and off the pavement, to bowl a hoop.” This list of childlike actions creates a sense of spontaneous joy and playfulness, despite her being thirty years old. The contrast between her age and these youthful impulses emphasizes the extraordinary nature of her emotional state.\nThe writer employs an extended metaphor comparing Bertha’s feelings to swallowing the sun: “as though you’d suddenly swallowed a bright piece of that late afternoon sun and it burned in your bosom, sending out a little shower of sparks into every particle.” This imagery of internal light and warmth effectively conveys both the intensity and the all-encompassing nature of her bliss. The metaphor continues throughout the passage with “that bright glowing place” and the description of her as “radiant,” creating a consistent thread of luminous imagery that mirrors her inner joy.\nThrough rhetorical questions like “Oh, is there no way you can express it without being ‘drunk and disorderly’?” and “Why be given a body if you have to keep it shut up in a case like a rare, rare fiddle?”, the writer reveals Bertha’s frustration with social constraints. These questions highlight the tension between her intense emotional experience and society’s expectations of proper behavior, emphasizing how overwhelming her feelings are.\nThe writer contrasts external cold with internal warmth to heighten the sense of Bertha’s inner joy. In the “dusky” and “chilly” dining-room, Bertha removes her coat because she “could not bear the tight clasp of it another moment.” This physical discomfort with constraint symbolizes her emotional state bursting beyond normal boundaries. The contrast between the cold air on her arms and the “bright glowing place” in her bosom emphasizes the intensity of her internal feelings.\nThe climactic moment with the mirror creates a powerful image of Bertha’s transformed state. The writer presents her hesitation (“She hardly dared to look”) followed by the revelation of seeing herself as “radiant, with smiling, trembly lips, with big, dark eyes and an air of listening, waiting for something… divine to happen.” This description combines physical appearance with emotional anticipation, suggesting Bertha sees herself as someone on the cusp of transcendent experience.\nThe writer varies sentence structure to mirror Bertha’s emotional state. Short, exclamatory phrases convey her bursts of feeling, while longer, flowing sentences with multiple clauses capture the overwhelming nature of her bliss. The use of ellipses (“waiting for something… divine to happen… that she knew must happen… infallibly”) creates a sense of breathless anticipation that mirrors Bertha’s emotional state.\n\n\nThe writer presents Charlie’s love for chocolate through a series of vivid contrasts and carefully crafted descriptions that emphasize both his desperate desire and his patient appreciation for the rare treat. The passage begins by establishing the stark contrast between Charlie’s meager daily diet of “cabbage and cabbage soup” and his longing for chocolate, immediately highlighting how precious and significant chocolate is to him.\nThe writer uses sensory imagery and physical actions to show the intensity of Charlie’s desire. When passing shop windows, he would “stop and stare and press his nose against the glass, his mouth watering like mad.” This visceral description of his physical reaction demonstrates how chocolate affects him on a fundamental level. The phrase “pure torture” emphasizes the emotional pain of seeing other children “munching them greedily,” creating a poignant picture of his deprivation.\nThe writer reveals the depth of Charlie’s love through his ritualistic treatment of his annual birthday chocolate. His careful placement of it in “a small wooden box” and treating it “as though it were a bar of solid gold” elevates the chocolate from mere candy to something sacred. The detailed description of how he makes the chocolate last - taking “tiny” nibbles and letting “the lovely sweet taste spread out slowly over his tongue” - shows both his self-discipline and his ability to find immense pleasure in even the smallest amount.\nThrough carefully chosen diction, the writer builds the emotional significance of chocolate in Charlie’s life. Words like “desperately,” “longed,” and “tortured” emphasize the intensity of his feelings, while the phrase “marvelous birthday mornings” suggests how this rare treat transforms ordinary moments into magical occasions. The writer also creates dramatic tension by hinting at “the one awful thing that tortured little Charlie… more than anything else,” building to the revelation of the chocolate factory’s proximity to his home.\n\n\nThe thought provoking opening statement with direct address “There are times in your life when something happens after which you’re never the same.” immediately draws the reader into the text and makes them wonder about this statement. The use of “never the same” with direct address creates a sense of intimacy and urgency, suggesting that the following events will be significant and transformative, connecting to both the reader’s life and perhaps the character in the story that is to follow.\nThe sentence of “To anybody else it would have been obvious - accidents hovering like hawks in the air” also intrigues the reader. This makes readers wonder why the narrator is not aware of the accidents, and why they are described as “hovering like hawks in the air.” The simile suggests a sense of danger and foreboding, creating an ominous tone that sets the stage for the events to come.\nThe suspense is further reinforced with the use of short sentences throughout the opening. “Rain still fell in a thin mist. The roads shone.”, “She claimed she was his daughter”, “When he did, he raised it to his face”, these sentences create an atmosphere of tension and anticipation for what is to come. The use of short sentences also creates a sense of urgency, as if the events are unfolding quickly, in the present and also in the flashbacks of the past. and the reader must keep up.\n\nAnalysis: “The Snow Kimono” Opening - Creating Interest, Place, and Character\nHow the Writer Interests the Reader\nIntriguing Opening Statement\nHenshaw immediately hooks the reader with the philosophical observation about life-changing moments: “There are times in your life when something happens after which you’re never the same.” This universal truth creates instant engagement as readers reflect on their own transformative experiences.\nMystery and Suspense\nThe writer creates compelling questions that drive reader interest:\n\nWhat is this “extraordinary claim” from the unknown woman?\nWhy does she claim to be Auguste’s daughter?\nWhat will Auguste do with this revelation?\n\nDramatic Revelation Structure\nThe narrative builds tension through delayed revelation - we learn about the letter first, then the claim, and finally the photograph that confirms the truth. This creates a satisfying “reveal” that maintains reader engagement.\nCreating a Sense of Place\nAtmospheric Weather Description\nHenshaw establishes mood through meteorological details: “it was dusk. The streetlamps were lit. Rain still fell in a thin mist. The roads shone.” This creates a noir-like atmosphere suggesting uncertainty and change.\nSpecific Geographical Anchoring\nThe precise location “rue St Antoine” and time “Paris: July 1989” immediately establish setting, giving readers clear spatial and temporal coordinates.\nSensory Environmental Details\nThe writer uses tactile imagery (“wet pavement”) and visual details (“accidents hovering like hawks in the air”) to create an immersive urban landscape that feels both beautiful and ominous.\nArchitectural Context\nReferences to “apartment building” and “foyer” establish the domestic, middle-class Parisian setting, grounding the character in a specific social context.\nCreating a Sense of Character\nPhysical Characterization\nAuguste is established through concrete details: “in his coat, his umbrella unfurled above his head” - presenting him as methodical and prepared, suggesting an orderly personality.\nBehavioral Patterns\nHis routine of “get his evening paper” and careful re-reading of the letter reveals someone who is habitual, thoughtful, and perhaps cautious in decision-making.\nEmotional State Through Action\nThe writer shows Auguste’s internal conflict through physical actions - standing in the “cool, empty foyer” repeatedly reading the letter demonstrates his shock and need to process this revelation.\nMoment of Recognition\nThe climactic moment “One look into the young woman’s eyes and he knew that it was true” reveals Auguste as someone who trusts his instincts and can recognize truth when confronted with it.\nPsychological Depth\nThe narrative structure - moving from the general philosophical statement to Auguste’s specific situation - suggests he’s experiencing exactly the kind of life-changing moment described in the opening, creating psychological coherence.\nLiterary Techniques Employed\nNarrative Structure: The text moves from universal to particular, creating thematic resonance\nSymbolism: The rain and dusk suggest transition and uncertainty\nForeshadowing: The opening statement prepares readers for Auguste’s transformation\nSelective Detail: The photograph detail is strategically delayed for maximum impact\nFree Indirect Discourse: We access Auguste’s thoughts and perceptions directly\nThe opening successfully establishes an atmospheric Parisian setting while introducing Auguste as a methodical man facing an unexpected revelation that will fundamentally alter his understanding of his life. The combination of philosophical weight, urban atmosphere, and personal drama creates compelling reader engagement."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Argue/Tourism-Footprints":{"title":"Tourism Footprints","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"43/50\nAlmost no spelling or grammar mistakes.\nCommunicated in a sophisticated way with discriminating selection and development of detail; sophisticated adaptation of form for purpose; creative vocabulary choices and phrasing; fully engaging readers\nSophisticated manipulation of sentence\nCreatively structured with sophisticated paragraphing for effect\nSpells a wide range of complex and irregular words correctly; occasional lapses may occur\nFeedback\nThoughtful and developed consideration\nStrong hook\nStrong imagery\nExamples, triplets, statistics, punctuation.\nMore use of punctuation for clarity and effect.\nDevelop focus on counter arguments to improve\nAs tourists flock to picturesque cities and natural wonders, what do they leave behind? Much like normal walking, people leave behind a ton of footprints – ones that both can both contribute \nto the local economy and disrupt local culture and environments. While tourism can boost the global economy, if its growth gets left unchecked, it will trample on the very places it seeks to celebrate, leading to environmental degradation, cultural dilution, and overcrowding.\nVenice is a top-rate tourist city. For those who have been there, the experience is like a serene dream. However, most tourists do not look back at what they are leaving behind. It’s only when they come back after their first visit, do they see the crowded cards, polluted waterways and compromised cultures. At its peak season, Verice offers 120,000 tourists a ‘vacation away from morals’, that is almost half the amount of its residents! This is a clear case of overtourism, where 80% of tourists go to 10% of the world’s places. Because of this, many tourist destinations are victims of their own popularity. In the case of Venice, not only does it lead to congestion, pollution and degradation, it also leads to Venice being viewed as a big theme park rather than a city. Traditional homes might be replaced by souvenir shops and luxury hotels, eroding away at the city’s culture and turning once authentic places into tourist traps. Venice is losing its culture and being transformed into a superficial tourist commodity rather than a place that can host millions and millions of authentic, nostalgic, and lifelong memories for its residents.\nSupporters for tourism claim that because the tourism industry amounts to 7.6% of the global GOP, it is beneficial for the world while providing relaxation for people. However, can a percentage of the global GDP fix the irreversible damage on our Earth? In 2019, the United Nations concluded that 5% of the global CO2 emissions and 22% of transport emissions were from tourism. Carbon emissions lead to climate change, which affects us all. We see that right now with the increased amount of hurricanes and the flooding of the Sahara Desert. Most people fly to the places they want to tour. Instead, have you ever wanted to go on a cruise ship? To feel the waves as the afternoon breeze gently sweeps your face? Certainly, the experience may be nice, but each trip on a cruise ship emits 1.2 - 9 tors of CO2. Considering even transatlantic flights produce less than 1 ton of CO2, that is a lot for a short ride on a long boat. If you somehow don’t care about climate change, think about the effects of CO2 on the very places you visit. The Great Barrier Reef’s corals are bleaching due to the warmer Ocean; ski resorts are facing shorter seasons to operate because of the dwindling snowfall. It is my considered opinion that the long-term damage to the environment far outweighs the temporary economic boosts.\nUltimately, the harms of tourism exist and we are starting to acknowledge that. Most tourist attractions haven’t been implementing mitigations or solutions, but some are starting to, Effective management, ecotourism and community-based tourism can make tourism more sustainable and friendlier to the environment and culture. Ecotourism is a form of tourism but with responsible travel and prioritization to visit natural sceneries with an aim to conserve that local culture and environment. Places like Kenya National Park are implementing community-based tourism, where all the revenue goes back into balancing and managing the tourists’ footprints. Due to global travel restrictions during the pandemic, the crowds disappeared and cities finally saw the footprints left by tourism. Venice started introducing visitor fees to reduce the amount of visitors and renovate Infrastructure; Amsterdam imposed a ban on cruise ships to reduce their carbon footprint.\nTourism’s damages to the environment and local people are undoubtedly undeniable. But this road to climate change and commodified cities can change if we participate and promote practices such as ecotourism, educate others, urge policy makers and reflect on our footprints. Just ask yourself this next time you travel: are you visiting to appreciate or to exploit?"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Argue/Tourism-is-harmful-to-the-environment-and-local-people.-Argue.":{"title":"Tourism is harmful to the environment and local people. Argue.","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Writing to argue\nYou may wish to include:\n\nhow tourism can have positive and negative effects on people and the environment\nhow tourism is an important industry\nhow tourism requires effective management, or it can become unsustainable\n\n\nResearch\nCons\n\nTourism, a significant contributor to the global economy, treads a fine line between exploitation and preservation. As travelers seek out the world’s wonders, they inevitably leave footprints - some beneficial, others detrimental. This article unpacks the complex relationship between tourism, the environment, and climate change, exploring the balance we must achieve for a sustainable future.\nTourism - one of the world’s largest industries, worth 7.6% of global GDP every year\nit can lead to a greater appreciation for nature and conservation, as tourists explore pristine beaches, lush forests, and scenic landscapes. This appreciation can translate into increased funding for national parks, wildlife conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage sites. For example, the revenue generated by the millions of tourists visiting Australia’s Great Barrier Reef also helps fundconservation efforts to protect this unique ecosystem.\n Mass tourism - where the number of tourists outpaces an area’s capacity - can damage ecosystems, disrupt or harm local wildlife, and lead to pollution. Venice, for example, has seen its canals crowded with boats and its historic streets thronged with visitors, leading to accelerated wear on its historic sites and increased pollution in its waters. Barcelona. It is one of the most important tourist destinations in Spain. Famous for its architecture, beaches, gastronomy, and culture. Mass tourism has driven locals out of the real estate market, as the amount of housing available for rent has been significantly reduced. To regulate this problem, actions have been taken such as the regulation of tourist accommodations, the prohibition of hotel construction, taxes on tourism and a limitation on the number of visitors. Venice. This Italian city, characterized by its canals, architecture, and history, has suffered from tourist overcrowding for years. Congestion, water pollution, erosion of buildings due to the entry of large boats, loss of identity, and price increases. To regulate this congestion, Venice has implemented city entrance fees, zone restrictions, the promotion of responsible tourism and the limitation of cruise ship entry.\nVenice has many nicknames: the ‘Queen of the Adriatic’, the ‘Floating City’ and ‘La Serenissima’ – the most serene. But as anyone who has been to Venice knows, on a typical day it can feel anything but serene. The city is notoriously mobbed with tourists. Up to 120,000 people visit Venice each day in peak season, but it has only 55,000 permanent residents. It is a phenomenon known as “overtourism”, where too many people visit the same place at the same time.Overtourism is a big problem, with 80% of the world’s tourists only going to 10% of the world’s destinations, according to the start-up consultancy Murmuration. Venice is probably the most notorious example, but other European cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam, Dubrovnik and Prague are also badly affected. The problem does not just make life unpleasant for residents and visits less enjoyable for tourists, it also puts significant strain on the environment and is hurting the climate. So many people flying into the same place degrades local ecosystems and natural defences against the effects of climate change. This in turn is causing worries that these oversaturated cities are going to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. The Covid-19 pandemic, which saw tourism to Venice suddenly stop completely, gave tourism operators a chance to pause and think. While the city stood eerily deserted, and businesses had to worry about how they would make ends meet, some also started to think – what if we didn’t go back to overtourism after this? Maggiori and a group of other tourism operators in the Veneto region decided to launch the ‘Slow Flow’ concept, organised visits around the rivers that feed the Venetian lagoon, by bike and boat. This can draw tourists out of Venice. It can also make for a more authentic experience.\nThe UN’s World Tourism Organization and the International Transport Forum concluded in 2019 that 5% of global emissions – and 22% of global transport emissions – are from transport-related international and domestic tourism. Overtourism’s worst offender is cruise ship tourism, which in 2016 emitted 24–30 million tonnes (t) of CO₂, with per passenger emissions ranging from 1.2–9t of CO₂ per trip. By comparison, a transatlantic flight emits a bit less than one tonne of CO2 per passenger, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. That means taking a cruise emits up to nine times more carbon than flying across the Atlantic.\npopular trekking trails in Nepal have experienced littering, resulting in environmental degradation.\nThe carbon footprint of tourism is another critical concern. Air travel, a significant component of global tourism, contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore climate change. The aviation sector contributes around 2% of annual global carbon dioxide emissions. A single long-haul flight can emit as much carbon dioxide as many people produce in a whole year.\nPopular destinations like the Maldives face the threat of rising sea levels, while natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef are endangered by coral bleaching due to warmer oceans. Additionally, ski resorts are increasingly struggling with shorter seasons due to dwindling snowfall. This reciprocal relationship between tourism and climate change highlights the urgent need for sustainable practices within the industry.\nOne of the most significant negative impacts of tourism is the degradation of natural environments. Tourist hotspots, particularly those in ecologically sensitive areas, frequently undergo habitat destruction due to infrastructure development. For example, the construction of hotels, resorts, roads, and other tourism facilities can result in deforestation, alteration of land, depletion of natural resources, and disruption to local ecosystems. In places like Bali, once-idyllic beaches are now flanked by sprawling resorts, affecting marine life and leading to significant erosion of the shoreline.\nthe influx of tourists surpasses the local waste management capacity, leading to pollution. For example, Mount Everest, often referred to as the “world’s highest garbage dump” is littered with oxygen cylinders, plastic waste, and even camping equipment discarded by climbers. Such uncontrolled waste not only spoils the landscape but can also contaminate local water sources, impacting both human and wildlife populations.\nNoise and light pollution are additional concerns in areas with heavy tourist traffic. The constant hum of boats, vehicles, and human activity can disturb wildlife (including vulnerable and endangered species), affecting their natural behaviors and breeding patterns. Sea turtles, for example, which rely on the moonlight to find their way from the beach to the ocean, can be disoriented by the bright lights from beachfront properties, making their survival even more precarious.\nPros\n numerous regions across the globe, tourism is the primary source of income, playing an instrumental role in sustaining economies and driving development. For countries with limited industrial or agricultural potential, the allure of their natural or cultural heritage can become their most lucrative asset.\nKenya. The allure of the ‘Big Five’ - lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros - and the vast, mesmerizing landscapes have drawn tourists in droves. Recognizing the economic potential, the Kenyan government has taken proactive steps to safeguard these natural assets. National parks and reserves, which now cover a significant portion of the country, not only protect the iconic wildlife but also generate substantial revenue. The revenue accrued from entrance fees, safari tours, and accommodation often goes back into conservation efforts, ensuring a sustainable cycle. Moreover, the value attached to these animals as tourist attractions inadvertently offers them a shield against poaching, as their value alive exceeds their value in body parts.\n\nsolutions?\nIt’s important to strike a balance. While tourism can be a tool for positive change, it needs to be managed with care, foresight, and a genuine commitment to sustainability. Only then can the potential benefits be harnessed without compromising the delicate ecosystems that make these destinations so special in the first place.\nTourism requires effective management to become sustainable; however, without such management, it often becomes harmful to both the environment and local communities. This dependency on careful oversight means that, in its unmanaged or mismanaged forms - which are common - tourism is inherently unsustainable and damaging.\n\\\n\nEco-tourism\nEco-tourism, a growing segment within the travel industry, emphasizes responsible travel to natural areas that conserve the environment, sustain the well-being of local people, and involve understanding and education. This form of tourism encourages minimal impact on the environment while providing economic benefits to local communities. For example, destinations like Costa Rica have successfully marketed themselves as eco-friendly hotspots, where tourists can enjoy the natural beauty while contributing to conservation efforts.\nConservation and community-based tourism\nCommunity-based tourism (CBT) focuses on empowering local communities by involving them directly in the tourism industry. This model ensures that the economic benefits of tourism are distributed fairly and that cultural and environmental integrity is maintained. By fostering a deeper connection between tourists and local cultures, CBT enhances the travel experience while promoting conservation and sustainable development. In places like Bhutan, where tourism is heavily regulated, visitors pay a sustainable development fee that contributes to the country’s conservation and cultural preservation efforts.\n\nCity taxes have become increasingly popular, with Barcelona increasing its nightly levy in April 2023 — which was originally introduced in 2012 and varies depending on the type of accommodation — and Venice expects to charge day-trippers a €5 fee from 2024.\nIn Amsterdam this summer, the city council voted to ban cruise ships, while the mayor, Femke Halsema, commissioned a campaign of discouragement, asking young British men who planned to have a ‘vacation from morals’ to stay away. In Rome, sitting at popular sites, such as the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, has been restricted by the authorities.\nAnd in Kenya’s Maasai Mara, meanwhile, the Narok County governor has introduced on-the-spot fines for off-roading. He also plans to double nightly park fees in peak season.\ncall to action\neducate yourself and others\nTravel Light\neco-tourism\nreduce waste\nreduce footprint\nbe energy conscious\navoid hotspots\nThe future of tourism depends on the collective efforts of all stakeholders - governments, businesses, communities, and travelers. Policymakers must implement regulations that incentivize sustainable practices, such as carbon taxes on flights and stricter environmental standards for tourism operators. Businesses in the tourism industry must commit to sustainability, not just as a marketing strategy, but as a core operational principle. \nLocal communities should be empowered to manage tourism in ways that benefit them economically while preserving their cultural and natural heritage. Travelers, too, must embrace a mindset of responsibility, understanding that every journey has an impact and making choices that minimize harm to the environment.\nOne of these is the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (GCET), a set of general principles intended to guide tourism development stakeholders, such as governments, communities, industry, and tourists. Its purpose is to maximize the benefits for the sector and reduce its negative impact on the environment. This organization has been recognized by the United Nations since 2001.\nThe path forward for the tourism industry is clear: embrace environmental sustainability or face the long-term consequences of environmental degradation and climate change. By investing in green infrastructure and promoting responsible travel practices, the industry can lead the way in creating a future where tourism and the environment coexist in harmony.\nfostering environmental and cultural awareness and respect, and providing positive and memorable experiences for visitors.

Example: Venice’s canals and pollution from heavy tourist traffic.\n• Pollution from Transport: Tourism transport is responsible for 5% of global emissions, with cruise ships emitting up to nine times more carbon than a transatlantic flight.\n• Carbon Footprint: Aviation emissions significantly contribute to climate change, with long-haul flights producing annual emissions equal to a typical person’s yearly carbon footprint.\n• DAFOREST Techniques:\n• Facts &amp; Statistics: “5% of global emissions stem from tourism-related transport,” to highlight the scale of environmental damage.\n• Imagery: Describe visuals like “polluted waterways and crowded city streets.”\nBody Paragraph 2: Impact on Local Communities\n• Topic Sentence:\n• “The social costs of tourism extend beyond the environment, disrupting local economies and cultures.”\n• Key Points:\n• Overtourism: Cities like Venice and Barcelona face ‘overtourism,’ where visitors outnumber residents, raising prices, reducing housing, and affecting locals’ quality of life.\n• Cultural Erosion: Local customs and heritage risk losing authenticity, replaced by superficial tourist attractions.\n• Economic Displacement: Locals pushed out of housing markets as real estate prices surge to accommodate tourists.\n• Counter-Argument: Tourism can fund local economies and conservation (use Kenya as an example).\n• DAFOREST Techniques:\n• Examples: Real-world examples like Venice’s daily crowds of 120,000 compared to 55,000 residents.\n• Alliteration: Phrases like “crowded canals and compromised cultures.”\nBody Paragraph 3: Solutions and Sustainable Tourism\n• Topic Sentence:\n• “For tourism to benefit rather than harm, effective management and sustainable practices are essential.”\n• Key Points:\n• Eco-Tourism: Countries like Costa Rica promote eco-friendly travel that benefits both the environment and the local economy.\n• Community-Based Tourism (CBT): Models like Kenya’s national parks, which reinvest tourist revenue into conservation efforts, ensuring long-term sustainability.\n• Regulation Efforts: Highlight examples like Venice’s visitor fees and Amsterdam’s cruise ship bans.\n• Call to Action: Encourage tourists to adopt responsible practices, such as reducing waste, opting for eco-tourism, and respecting local customs.\n• DAFOREST Techniques:\n• Direct Address: Speak to the reader directly with a call to action.\n• Statistics: Mention specific figures for fees or eco-tourism’s growth as a sector.\nConclusion\n• Restate Thesis:\n• “Tourism’s potential for positive change is undeniable, yet without careful management, its harms often outweigh its benefits.”\n• Summarize Key Points: Briefly touch on the environmental and social costs of unmanaged tourism.\n• Concluding Thought:\n• “The future of tourism lies in sustainable practices; without them, both the destinations we cherish and the communities we visit will pay the price.”\n• Rhetorical Techniques:\n• Emotive Language: Urge readers to think about the long-term impact on beloved destinations.\n• Powerful Statement: “By embracing eco-tourism and respecting local cultures, we ensure tourism serves the planet, not just profits.”\nUseful Sentences to Include\n\nIntroduction:\n\n• “Tourism, though a powerful economic driver, leaves a mark that stretches far beyond economic gains.”\n\nBody Paragraphs:\n\n• “Each flight taken, each cruise embarked upon, adds a little more carbon to our already warming atmosphere.”\n• “In cities like Barcelona, where tourism booms, housing options shrink for locals, leaving them priced out of their own neighborhoods.”\n\nConclusion:\n\n• “True sustainability requires not just changes from governments and businesses, but also choices by travelers themselves.”\nDAFOREST Devices to Remember\n\n\nDirect Address: Talk to readers to make them feel involved in the issue.\n\n\nAlliteration: Use catchy phrases like “polluted paradise,” “crowded canals,” or “congested cities.”\n\n\nFacts &amp; Statistics: Integrate statistics such as “Tourism accounts for 22% of transport emissions globally.”\n\n\nRhetorical Questions: Pose questions like “Is the cost of a perfect photo worth the environmental damage?”\n\n\nWith this structure and these points, your essay will present a balanced, convincing argument that uses strong examples and rhetorical techniques.

They said the view would get better up here, but the scenery was a foreboding blur. Inside, the air tasted of toner dust and mothballed secrets. You’d survived two weeks in this mausoleum of billable hours, yet your cubicle still reeked of the last occupant.\nThe assignment arrived at dawn, slipped under your door in an envelope swollen with humidity. Case 16-08. No instructions, only a Post-it: Bayer Estate. 3 PM. Do not speak unless spoken to. You’d heard the name in whispers from the vents —the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.” You look around. You hear a suit being adjusted, a mug being gripped, and then a gentle sip.\nThe hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. Your car choked to death. Silence fills the car, broken only by you tightening your tie. You are left in the grey haze.\nThe mansion wasn’t architecture—it was a tumor. A shadow against the storm. Limestone walls bulged as if something pulsed beneath, ivy strangling the cracks like sutures. Gargoyles perched above the door, their mouths agape in silent screams, rainwater pooling in their hollow eyes. You counted six before the door creaked open.\nBayer stood framed in the threshold, in a fresh suit. His skin hung too tight over the bones, as if starched. When you shook his hand, the texture shocked you—not flesh, but cured leather, the kind used to bind forbidden ledgers.\nYou hear him rasp, telling you to follow him. The walls swallowed light. Dust sheets draped furniture into ghostly shapes, and the floorboards groaned. You are lead through halls with portraits of stern-faced men as their eyes follow your steps. You passed a half-open door.\nDon’t look.\nYou looked.\nThe laboratory stank of formaldehyde and rot. Shelves sagged under jars of amber and cyan liquid, each housing horrors: rats, mutated, alive, dead, their bodies split open to reveal coiled viscera; a fetus floating mid-transformation, half-rodent, half-infant. On the floor, umbrellas lay splayed like skinned bats, their canopies translucent—membrane, you realized, human epidermis stretched over wire ribs. You swallow, your throat is dry. A centrifuge hummed in the corner, spinning vials of murky fluid.\nYou continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. My. Bayer goes to sit behind a mahogany desk, sleek, rectangular, the only piece of furniture that seemed to be up kept.\nYou are slid a file towards you by him.\n“Disappear this. Permanently.”\nThe pages were blank.\nNo—not blank. You tilted them toward the light and saw the indentations, the ghost of text pressed into the paper by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: Senna Voss, 34, exposure event.\n“My competitor’s research,”\n“And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” You detect that his voice softened.\n“Your firm excels at… cleanup. Bill it as document review. I will handle the rest afterwards.”\nYou see his eyes glance behind you, into the lab, you try to not realize.\nHis gaze pins me, like a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing, squishing you, and forcing you to comply and stay still. Your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth.\nTwo weeks earlier, they’d shown you the shredder room. “Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,” Hargrove had smirked, patting the machine like a beloved hound. Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings, her rosary swinging like a grandfather clock. Eddie’s cart creaking, his limp, his fall from the ladder, his hymn. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a guillotine, straightening a framed photo of himself shaking hands with a senator. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade ago. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed. You find yourself in a place where you don’t think you will ever be in, but it does not feel totally different here in this estate or at the firm.\n“Your cubicle is here. This is your in and out box, you will do the work in your in box and hand them in in your out box or directly to firm partners. You will do what you are told to. You will shred if asked to shred. You will come in after hours, overtime is not paid. You will not answer your phone if it rings past 6pm, let it roll to voicemail.”\nThe office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat.\nDown the hall, Miles slumped in his chair. His highlighter’s tip wobbled, then followed the upper part of the body, the highlighter slipped, but it brought his hand down with it, streaking yellow across the desk. His eyes did not waver though, it stayed fixed on his screen, as if it drained his face pale. Fixed. You hear a highlighter being dropped onto the floor. He then slowly, started turning clockwise, head followed by shoulder. What was he turning for. You observer that the turn lasted for 4 seconds, there was nothing behind him. He turned, his body sagged. His desk held a Christmas basket, it was February, a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.”  A specter from the ’80s benzene case.\nThat was orientation. She left you there, her voice trailing off: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”\n“Well?” Bayer’s jaw unhinges slightly, too wide for a human smile. He leans forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk.\nYou reached for your pen.\nThe lights died.\nWhen they sputtered back on, Bayer was gone. Two doors materialized in the far wall, both ajar. You chose the left.\nThe hill’s air now reeked of burnt sugar. Your car started instantly, the radio whispering static. As you reversed, the mansion’s windows flashed—figures pressed against the glass, their palms leaving smears. One resembled Lena Voss’s employee badge photo. Another, Eddie.\nThe road unspooled into the city’s glow. In the rearview, your reflection wavered—eyes hollow, hair streaked white. The file sat beside you, its pages now visible:\nLena Voss v. Bayer Chemical.\nCause of death: acute exposure to Compound 16-08. Symptoms: epidermal shedding, ocular hemorrhage, vocal cord liquefaction.\nRecommended action: settlement via non-disclosure. Client requests all biological remains be given to him, for bury.\nOutside your cubicle, a shadow coalesced. Tall, slender, its edges bleeding into the dark. You didn’t turn. You know better now.\nThe firm had many teeth. You are simply the latest.\nRain lashed the windows as you typed, the keys clattering like bones. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, hungry again.\nYou don’t hear, but feel the whisper now. Good job. Welcome to Alamont &amp; Bergmann, do your job now.\n1. Literary Devices (16/25)\nStrengths:\n\nVivid metaphors (“mausoleum of billable hours,” “the mansion was a tumor”) and grotesque imagery (umbrellas as “skinned bats,” mutated specimens) effectively evoke dread.\nSymbolism (blank pages with ghost text, “the Gardener”) hints at hidden corruption, aligning with Gothic themes of secrecy.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nOveruse of strained metaphors: Some comparisons (e.g., “asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud”) feel repetitive rather than impactful.\nMixed imagery: The lab’s “human epidermis umbrellas” borders on sensationalism, risking reader immersion.\nUnderdeveloped motifs: The recurring “ledger” and “2015 typo” lack clear symbolic payoff, leaving the theme of guilt incomplete.\n\n\n2. Use of Gothic Genre (18/25)\nStrengths:\n\nAtmosphere: Strongly establishes a claustrophobic, decaying world (toner dust, mothballed secrets, “limestone walls bulged”).\nTropes: Effective use of Gothic staples: reclusive aristocrat, haunted estate, grotesque experiments, and moral decay.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nClichés: Gargoyles with “hollow eyes” and portraits with “following eyes” lack originality.\nPacing: The abrupt shift to flashbacks (Hargrove, Clara) disrupts tension. Prioritize slow-burn unease over disjointed reveals.\nPlot coherence: The protagonist’s role (“Disappear this. Permanently.”) and connection to Senna Voss are underexplored, weakening narrative stakes.\n\n\n3. Punctuation Variety (12/20)\nStrengths:\n\nEffective use of em dashes and fragments (“Don’t look. You looked.”) to heighten tension.\nColons and semicolons (“Case 16-08. No instructions, only a Post-it: Bayer Estate. 3 PM.”) create a brisk, clinical tone.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nComma splices: “You swallow, your throat is dry” should be revised to a period or semicolon.\nInconsistent tense: Shifts between past and present (e.g., “You are lead” → “led”; “His gaze pins me” → “pinned”) disrupt flow.\nOveruse of hyphens: “half-rodent, half-infant” works, but “mothballed-secrets” (hyphen needed) is missing punctuation.\n\n\n4. Sentence Structure (13/20)\nStrengths:\n\nVaried sentence lengths build rhythm (e.g., short, punchy phrases like “Silence fills the car” contrast with longer descriptions).\nIntentional fragments (“A name: Senna Voss, 34, exposure event.”) enhance mystery.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPassive voice: “You are slid a file” → “He slides a file” would sharpen immediacy.\nAwkward phrasing: “You are lead through halls…” (tense error) and “the ink seemed to bleed” (mixed metaphor).\nConvoluted syntax: “His gaze pins me, like a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing, squishing you…” confuses perspective (me/you).\n\n\n5. Reader Response (15/20)\nStrengths:\n\nImmersion: The oppressive atmosphere and sensory details (“reeked of the last occupant,” “formaldehyde and rot”) successfully unsettle the reader.\nAmbiguity: The unresolved ending (“a place where you don’t think you will ever be”) suits Gothic uncertainty.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nEmotional disconnect: The protagonist’s internal conflict (e.g., guilt over Senna Voss) is told, not shown, reducing empathy.\nConfusion: Flashbacks (Eddie’s fall, Clara’s rosary) feel tangential without clear ties to the main plot.\n\n\nSummary:\nThis story demonstrates a strong grasp of Gothic aesthetics and mood but suffers from structural and technical inconsistencies. The imagery is visceral but occasionally overwrought, and the plot’s ambiguity crosses into confusion. Tighten narrative focus, refine punctuation, and clarify character motivations to elevate cohesion and impact.\nActionable Feedback:\n\nSimplify metaphors; prioritize precision over extravagance.\nFix tense shifts and punctuation errors to maintain immersion.\nFlesh out Senna Voss/the ledger subplot to deepen thematic resonance.\nReplace clichéd Gothic tropes with fresher, more nuanced horrors.\n"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Imagine/Alamont-and-Bergmann/Revised":{"title":"Revised","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"You’d heard the name in whispers from the vents —the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash.

Your car choked to death. Silence fills the car, broken only by you tightening your tie. You are left in the grey haze.\n\nBayer loomed in the threshold, his suit not merely fresh but impossibly pristine, as though stitched from the fabric of midnight itself. His skin stretched over his bones like damp parchment, so taut it threatened to tear, hinting at the unnatural vitality squirming beneath. When you grasped his hand, it repelled you—not with the warmth of flesh, but with the chill of ancient leather, the kind that binds tomes of forbidden lore, dry as dust and smooth as a gravestone.\nHis voice slithered forth, a rasp from bloodless lips: “Follow.” The word lingered, oppressive as a funeral pall. As you obeyed, the walls seemed to breathe, inhaling light and hope, exhaling a cold that gnawed at your marrow. Dust sheets shrouded the furniture, but these were no mere coverings—they were tattered cerements, veiling shapes that bulged and writhed, grotesque silhouettes of things better left unseen. The floorboards sighed beneath your feet, each creak a labored exhalation from the house’s living heart.\nPortraits lined the shadowed halls, their stern-faced subjects glaring down with eyes that didn’t merely follow—they pierced, they hungered. As you passed, their expressions twisted, sternness melting into malevolent sneers, lips curling as if tasting your fear. Ahead, a door hung ajar, its gap a yawning maw that whispered temptation.\nDon’t look.\nYou couldn’t resist.\nThe laboratory assaulted your senses with a miasma of formaldehyde, rot, and a cloying sweetness—like fruit festering in a crypt. Shelves groaned under the weight of jars, their contents suspended in fluids of amber, cyan, and nameless shades. Within, abominations writhed: rats, flayed and split, their viscera coiling with unnatural life; a fetus trapped in perpetual flux, its form flickering between rodent and infant, an eternal unborn horror. On the floor, what you took for umbrellas lay splayed—not fabric, but skin, human epidermis stretched taut over wire frames, translucent membranes threaded with veins that pulsed faintly, as though still tethered to life. Your throat tightened, bile rising as the truth sank in.\nIn the corner, a centrifuge droned, its hum a grotesque mimicry of a heartbeat, spinning vials of liquid so murky it devoured light. The air thickened, pressing against you like a sentient force, and the house itself seemed to watch—its walls, its portraits, its very essence—judging, craving, consuming.\n\nHis gaze impales you, a collector’s pin piercing a butterfly’s fragile wing, crushing your spirit beneath its unyielding weight, forcing you to stillness, to submission. Your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth, dry as ash, as if the air itself has withered it to dust.\nTwo weeks prior, they ushered you into the shredder room—a crypt of secrets. Hargrove’s smirk twisted like a reaper’s scythe as he rasped, “Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,” his hand caressing the machine as though it were a ravenous beast, its jaws gnashing for flesh, not just paper. The air hung thick with the stench of scorched ink and something fouler—decay, perhaps, or the slow festering of consciences long buried.\n…\nAnd there, in the ledger, your name—scrawled in 2015, a decade before your arrival, the ink bleeding like a fresh wound. “Typo,” Clara muttered, but her voice trembled, and the page seemed to pulse. You stood in a place you never imagined, yet the estate and the firm mirrored each other—twin labyrinths of corruption, their roots entwined in shadow.\n“Your cubicle is here,” she commanded, her voice a whip’s crack. “This is your in-box, your out-box. You will labor over what is given, deliver it to the partners. You will obey. You will shred when commanded. You will toil after dusk—overtime earns no coin. You will not answer the phone past 6 PM—let it drift to the tomb of voicemail.” The office sprawled before you, a decaying garden of cubicles, their walls peeling like sloughing bark, the vents exhaling a low, guttural hum—the building’s breath, heavy with the rot of trapped souls.\nDown the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, a wilted husk. His highlighter trembled, then dragged his hand downward, streaking yellow across the desk like a smear of jaundice. His eyes remained fixed, unblinking, as if the screen leeched the life from his pallid face. Then came the soft thud—the highlighter slipping to the carpet. Slowly, he began to turn—clockwise, head guiding shoulder, a mechanical twist, as though marionette strings jerked him toward the void. For four endless seconds, his gaze swept the empty air behind him, seeking nothing. There was nothing. His frame sagged further, collapsing inward. On his desk, a Christmas basket moldered—it was February—a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.” A relic of the ’80s benzene case, when the firm severed its last thread of virtue.\nThat was your orientation. Her voice faded into the gloom: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”\nNow, in Bayer’s office, his jaw unhinges, stretching too wide for mortal flesh, a grotesque blossom of malice. He leans forward, his shadow unfurling, a creeping vine that devours the desk, the room, the very air. The walls tighten, the estate and firm fusing into one suffocating maw, and you are no longer merely pinned—you are planted, rooted in this garden of despair, awaiting the Gardener’s pruning blade.\n\nBack at your cubicle, a shadow pools—tall, slender, bleeding into the dark. Don’t turn. You know better.\nThe firm had many teeth, and you are simply the latest to be sharpened. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, its hunger for secrets never sated—a beast always ready to devour the truth.\nYou don’t hear, but feel the whisper now, a cold breath against your soul: “Good job. Welcome to Alamont &amp; Bergmann. You’ve proven your worth. Now, keep climbing.”\nThe corporate ladder stretches before you, each rung slick with the grease of compromised ethics. You’ve taken your first step by shredding that file, by burying the firm’s sins in its shadows. The path back is lost in the fog of your ambition, and the view from here is already tainted by the weight of your choice.\nThe shredder’s growl becomes a lullaby, soothing you into the numbness of complicity.\nAnd as the rain continues to lash the windows, you’ve made your choice."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Imagine/Alamont-and-Bergmann/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"You’ve clawed your way into this job—six figures, a colonial office tower, a prestigious firm steeped in shadows.

Partners murmur his title with trembling reverence, their eyes darting to the shadows. You glance around—the office’s crumbling facades close in, shadows shifting as if alive.

Welcome aboard. You’re a legal assistant now, fresh meat for the billable grind. That’s your desk, third cubicle from the window—frosted glass, ergonomic chair, a monitor that hums faintly when you boot it up. The office gleams: polished steel, white walls, LED lights that buzz like a hive if you listen too long.  Everyday, the air will feel thick by 5 p.m. You’ll get used to it. Or you won’t.\nHere’s the drill: clock in by 7 a.m. You will be tracked. Don’t give them ammo for your review. Your will come in 50 hours a week, minimum, but aim for 60 if you want a bonus. You will not be paid for overtime. You will keep your calendar public. You will not pick up the phone if it rings after 6 p.m., let it roll to voicemail. The voice on the other end isn’t HR, and it’s not your problem. Yet.\nThat’s Clara’s cube next to yours. She’s been here six years, no law degree, just a knack for sniffing out weak spots in deposition transcripts. She’s good—too good, maybe. She won’t advance any further than this though Last month, she flagged a plaintiff’s tax filings that killed a $12 million suit. “Creative discovery,” she called it, but her hands shook when she handed me the printout. She keeps a rosary taped under her desk drawer. Doesn’t touch it anymore. If she offers you coffee, say no—it’s lukewarm and bitter.\nOver there’s the mailroom. **That’s Eddie sorting briefs, hunched over a cart stacked with FedEx envelopes. Thirty-two years here. He hums hymns while he works, low and mournful, like something you’d hear over a grave. **Don’t ask about his limp. Non-disclosure agreement. **\nThis glass office is Miles Tanner’s. Junior partner, thirty-four, already thinning up top. He billed 3,200 hours last year—eighty a week, no holidays. Lost his fiancée over it; He’ll flash you a smile, all teeth, but his eyes stay flat, like he’s sizing you up for a deposition. **** You will do what he asks when he asks, you will shred if he asks you to shred. ****\nUpstairs is the senior suite. That’s where Victor Hargrove holds court. Armani suit, a walking American Psycho reboot. He’s the kind of guy who’d kill you with a pen and bill the client for the cleanup. Last week, he spent three hours berating a first-year associate over a misplaced comma in a brief—voice calm, eyes gleaming. He’s got a corner office with a view of the skyline, blackout shades always half-drawn. You will see that the view gets better up from here.\nThe firm’s not old, not really. The building’s LEED-certified, retrofitted in 2018—motion-sensor lights, recycled carpet, the works. But it feels heavy, doesn’t it? Like the walls are watching, tallying your hours, your typos, your bathroom breaks. The vents are breathing and the Christmas baskets are watching. Won the case, lost two rivers. The client’s still with us—sends a Christmas basket every year, stuffed with truffles and a card that says, “To loyalty.” Hargrove keeps it on his desk like a trophy. You will feel someone watching, some chain-rattling specter, weight of deals signed in blood, clients who don’t care who gets crushed as long as the motions are filed on time.\nYour first task is simple. See that black ledger on the third shelf? Log this entry: Case 87-12, February 21, 2025, your initials. It’s a pro bono file, technically, but no one talks about it. Don’t ask why—just write the date and sign. Quick, now—Miles is watching from his perch.\nWait. You’re flipping back, aren’t you? Saw something. Your name, there, ten years ago—2015. Same initials, same block print. Typo, probably. Happens when you’re tired, rushing to meet a deadline. The ledger’s old, sure, but not that old—rebound every decade, fresh paper. Still, it’s odd. I’d laugh it off, but Clara’s staring at you now, her pen frozen mid-sentence. Eddie’s humming louder. Ignore it. Close the book. Move on.\nAfter a while here, you hear the real ghosts, whispering through wired transfers and NDAs, they will haunt you…\nThat’s the civil war here: not screaming matches, but papercuts. A paralegal hoards a key exhibit, stalling a junior’s deadline. A mailroom guy “loses” discovery docs to settle a grudge. Clara’s after Miles’s office; Miles is eyeing Hargrove’s throne. Hargrove just watches, amused, like a vulture circling a battlefield. You? You’re cannon fodder till you prove otherwise.\nSo pace yourself. Too fast, and they’ll bury you in motions to draft—Hargrove loves a workhorse. Too slow, and you’re out, replaced by next week’s hire. Watch the ladder, but don’t climb blind. Eddie’s trapped, Clara’s fraying, Miles is fading, and Hargrove’s a psychopath with a corner office. The firm’s not crumbling—not yet—but it’s rotting from the inside, one billable hour at a time. That’s my desk over there. I’ve been here twelve years, too long to leave, too short to matter. Finish that entry. The clock’s ticking.\n\ndraft two\nRain lashes the windows today, February 24, 2025, a gray curtain blurring the skyline beyond Kessler, Hargrove &amp; Tate’s glass tower. The drops drum against the panes like fingers tapping an impatient rhythm, and the wind howls low, a moan that seeps through the seals. I sit at my desk, third cubicle from the window, the same one they gave me three days ago on orientation. The file in front of me—Case 19-45—stinks: a partner’s signature on the dotted line. My pen hovers over the page, and I can’t shake the memory of that first day, the way the air felt too thick, the way the firm’s ghosts whispered louder than I knew.\nI nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge’s gavel mid-ruling. She walked me past the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high with FedEx envelopes, and his hymn floated up—“dust to dust”—a dirge that clung to the walls. His shadow stretched long, bent at the knee where it shouldn’t, and I wondered then if the firm had snapped him like a twig underfoot.\nClara’s cube came next. Her fingers danced over the keyboard, unearthing dirt from a plaintiff’s 1099s, a smirk tugging her lips as she typed. But her hands trembled, spilling coffee onto a blotter stained with older stains. She offered me a cup later, the mug warm but the brew cold, and I saw the shadows pooling under her eyes—ghosts of cases she’d bent till they broke. Down the hall, Miles Tanner’s glass office glowed like a lantern in fog. He leaned back in his chair, tie loose, grinning. His reflection in the glass looked thinner, fading, a man dissolving into his own ambition.\nThen the senior suite, upstairs. Victor Hargrove’s door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine’s edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief’s misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm’s gothic prince: a Bateman born of boardrooms, thriving on the kill. I glimpsed his desk—a Christmas basket, truffles spilling out, a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.” The chemical client’s ghost, I’d learn later, a specter from the ’80s benzene case.\nThe building wasn’t old—not really. But it breathed, didn’t it? The vents sighed like a dying man’s rattle, the walls loomed close, tallying every keystroke. There was a ladder, rungs slick with sweat and ink of misdeeds, I already felt it then, the ladder rising before me. Eddie toiled at its base, a gargoyle chained to his cart, humming hymns to ward off the inevitable. Clara clawed upward, her long nails leaving gouges in Miles’s shadow—he stumbled mid-step, his hours a noose tightening with every late night. Hargrove perched at the peak, a raven feasting on the carrion of lesser men, his throne unassailable yet trembling under the client’s unseen hand. You think its real, the same ladder was everywhere in the firm.\n“Your first task,” she said, handing me a black ledger, its leather cool as a crypt slab. “Case 87-12, February 21, 2025. Date it, initial it, third shelf.” And there—ten years back, 2015—my name stared up, initials mirrored in block print. My breath caught; the pen slipped. “Typo,” she said, too quick, but Eddie’s hymn swelled, Clara’s chair squeaked still. You shrugged it off, hell, it was 6 figures anyways, and just a coincidence.\nYou finished your orientation. She left me there, her voice trailing off: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”\nWhispers and shadows. The ladder swayed, rungs cracking, and I stood at the bottom, staring up at a spire lost in fog.\nThe ghosts are louder, their whispers curling through the vents: Sign it. Bury it. Bill it. I see Eddie’s cart rattling past, his dreams buried within the documents; Clara’s rosary swinging, like a grandfather clock; Miles’s grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove’s laugh echoes down, sharp as a blade, and the ledger’s shadow stretches long, my name carved in its depths. The firm’s not crumbling.\n\nthird draft\nRain streaked the windows like tears on a mourner’s face, blurring the skyline beyond Kessler, Hargrove &amp; Tate’s glass tower. The sense of foreboding that clung to the air. The wind’s mournful cry echoing the despair gnawing at me. Three days ago, I’d walked into this office with a crisp keycard and a stomach full of ambition. Now, the weight of Case 19-45 sat on my desk, its pages heavy with compromise: a client’s tax evasion buried in shell companies, a partner’s signature sealing the lie. My pen hovered, trembling under its sheer heaviness.\nFifth floor, east wing, paralegal row. My desk waited, chair angled just so, monitor humming awake like it’d been expecting me. Clara sat nearby, shoulders tense, eyes fixed on a deposition transcript. Her fingers struck the keys with furious intensity, the scratching sound echoing in the quiet office. She didn’t glance my way, but I noticed the rosary beads wrapped around her wrist, the cross swaying with each movement—a ward against some unseen evil or a plea for forgiveness. Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen with a worried frown. Her voice was weary even from afar, but there was steel in her gaze despite its cracks.\nThe senior paralegal led me through the motions, her voice flat as a courtroom transcript. “Clock in by 7:45,” she said, nodding to the keycard scanner blinking red on the wall. “Partners track the logs. Billable target’s 1,800 hours—40 a week if you want a pulse come bonus season.” I nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge’s gavel. She walked me past the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high with FedEx envelopes, and he hummed a mournful tune—“dust to dust”—a dirge that clung to the walls. His limp was more pronounced today, and I remembered the rumors: a brilliant lawyer, fallen from grace, his career shattered by a single mistake. Now, he was a ghost haunting the halls, a cautionary tale. As he passed, he caught my eye and gave a small, bitter smile, his fingers drumming on the cart’s handle—a nervous habit, perhaps, or a remnant of the man he’d been.\nDown the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, tie loose, eyes bloodshot. He stared at his screen, fingers stained with highlighter ink. “I can’t do this anymore,” he muttered as I passed. “The client’s guilty, and we’re supposed to make it go away. But at what cost?” His words hung in the air, a challenge to the firm’s ethics, and I felt them settle in my chest like a stone. Later, over coffee in the break room, he leaned in, his voice low. “I used to think this was the dream, you know? Big firm, big cases. But now? I’m drowning.” He rubbed his eyes, and I noticed the tremor in his hands, the weight of his disillusionment.\nThen, the senior suite. Victor Hargrove’s door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine’s edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief’s misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm’s gothic prince: a predator born of boardrooms, thriving on the kill. His desk held a Christmas basket, truffles spilling out, a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.” The chemical client’s ghost, I’d learn later, a specter from the ’80s benzene case, still feeding the firm’s veins with dirty gold.\nThe office was a labyrinth of cubicles, each a tiny prison cell where dreams went to die. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly glow on the workers’ faces. The air was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and broken promises, a constant reminder of the compromises made in the name of success. Though the building was new—LEED-certified, retrofitted, all sharp edges and recycled air—it breathed, didn’t it? The vents shuddered with each gust, exhaling a stale chill that brushed my skin like a sigh. The Kessler legacy hung thick: profit carved from flesh, a cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts. The once-pristine carpets were now stained with coffee spills, the walls marred by scuffs and scratches, each mark a testament to the firm’s moral decay.\nAs I turned back to my desk, I caught a glimpse of movement in the window’s reflection—a tall, shadowy figure standing in my cubicle’s doorway. But when I spun around, there was nothing. My heart raced, and I wondered if the stress was finally getting to me. Yet, the presence lingered, a whisper at the edge of my mind, watching. Later, in the break room, I felt it again—a cold draft, a flicker in the corner of my vision. I turned, but the room was empty, save for the hum of the vending machine. The shadow appeared at odd moments: in the elevator, its reflection in the polished steel; in the hallway, a fleeting glimpse as I passed a darkened office. Each time, it vanished when I looked directly, leaving only a chill and a sense of being watched.\n“Your first task,” the senior paralegal said, handing me a black binder, its leather cool as a crypt slab. “Case 87-12, February 21, 2025. Date it, initial it, third shelf.” I opened it, and a faint scent of damp earth wafted up, like something long buried. The pages were yellowed, the ink faded, but the dates were impossible—cases from decades ago, names I didn’t recognize. I shut it quickly, filed it, but the shadow in my periphery deepened, and Eddie’s hymn swelled, a warning.\nThat was orientation. She left me there, her voice trailing off: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.” I didn’t see it then—the war beneath the surface. Clara slipped a memo to Hargrove, cc’ing Miles’s latest flub—a motion filed late, a client’s ire stoked. Miles retaliated, hoarding a key exhibit till Clara’s deadline bled out. Eddie “misplaced” a junior’s discovery packet, his limp heavier that day, a grudge settled in silence. The ladder swayed, rungs cracking under their quiet sieges, and I stood at the bottom, staring up at a spire lost in fog.\nNow, three days later, the rain hammered on. Case 19-45 sat open: a client’s shell game, millions shuffled offshore, Hargrove’s scrawl green-lighting it. My pen trembled over the non-disclosure, ink pooling like blood. The shadow flickered again, closer now, and I felt its gaze—cold, insistent. I saw Eddie’s cart rattle past, a hearse for his dreams; Clara’s rosary swinging, a noose she wouldn’t wear; Miles’s grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove’s laugh echoed down, sharp as a blade, and the binder’s weight tugged like a summons from below.\nThen, the assignment came: destroy the evidence for Case 19-45. A single document, a loose thread that could unravel the client’s lies. The partners made it clear—shred it, and the case goes away. My career climbs another rung. But as I reached for the shredder, the shadow solidified, its form almost tangible, a silent accusation. I thought of Clara, working late to support her family; of Eddie, his dreams shattered by the firm’s ruthlessness; of Miles, his conscience eroded by daily compromises. And I knew I couldn’t do it.\nWith a steady hand, I picked up the document and walked to Hargrove’s office. The shadow followed, a whisper of approval or warning—I couldn’t tell. Hargrove looked up, his smile thinning. “Problem?” he asked, voice like ice. I laid the document on his desk. “This stays,” I said. “I won’t bury it.”\nHis eyes narrowed, but I turned and walked out, the shadow dissolving behind me. The rain had stopped, and a sliver of sunlight broke through the clouds. I took a deep breath, the air fresh and clean. Behind me, the glass tower loomed, but it no longer felt like a prison. I had made my choice, and though the path ahead was uncertain, I knew it was the right one. The ghosts of Kessler, Hargrove &amp; Tate would haunt me no more.\n\nAs an IGCSE English teacher, I’ll evaluate this gothic story based on two criteria: how well it embodies the gothic genre and its overall quality as a narrative. I’ll assign scores out of 100 for each and provide specific suggestions for improvement, focusing on areas where the story could “show” rather than “tell.”\n\n1. How Gothic Is This Story? (Marked out of 100)\nScore: 85/100\nThis story strongly captures many elements of gothic literature, creating a compelling atmosphere and exploring dark themes, though there’s room to deepen its gothic roots.\n\n\nAtmosphere and Setting:\nThe story excels at establishing a melancholic and ominous tone, a cornerstone of gothic literature. Descriptions like “Rain streaked the windows like tears on a mourner’s face” and “the sense of foreboding that clung to the air” immediately set a mood of dread. The office, portrayed as a “labyrinth of cubicles” and “tiny prison cells,” feels oppressive, while the building’s personification (“it breathed, didn’t it?”) adds a gothic sense of unease. However, the modern corporate setting lacks some traditional gothic imagery, such as decaying castles or crypts. While the twist of a glass tower works creatively, emphasizing its “moral decay” visually (e.g., cracks in the facade or flickering lights) could align it more closely with the genre.\n\n\nSupernatural or Inexplicable Events:\nThe shadowy figure that appears and vanishes is a classic gothic trope, generating mystery and tension. Its fleeting presence in the elevator, hallway, and break room effectively unnerves the reader. However, its role feels somewhat detached from the main plot—the moral dilemma over Case 19-45. Tying the shadow more explicitly to the firm’s corrupt past or the protagonist’s guilt would make it a stronger gothic element.\n\n\nThemes of Moral Decay and Psychological Turmoil:\nThe story shines here, a key strength of gothic literature. The firm’s unethical practices, the protagonist’s struggle with signing the document, and the compromised lives of Clara, Eddie, and Miles reflect moral decay and inner conflict. The “cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts” beautifully encapsulates this theme, blending gothic imagery with corporate critique.\n\n\nGothic Archetypes and Motifs:\nVictor Hargrove fits the gothic antagonist mold—a “predator born of boardrooms” with a cruel laugh and commanding presence. The shadow figure hints at a supernatural entity, but the story could lean more into archetypes like entrapment or madness to fully embrace the genre.\n\n\nWhy 85?\nThe story nails atmosphere, moral decay, and unease, but the supernatural element isn’t fully integrated, and the modern setting misses some traditional gothic markers. With tighter connections and richer imagery, it could feel even more gothic.\n\n2. Overall Story Quality (Marked out of 100)\nScore: 80/100\nThis is a well-crafted narrative with evocative prose and solid character depth, though it has areas where subtlety and pacing could be improved.\n\n\nProse and Imagery:\nThe writing is vivid and rich, with standout phrases like “the chemical client’s ghost” and “a cathedral of greed with stained-glass contracts.” These enhance the gothic tone and thematic depth. However, some descriptions, like “its pages heavy with compromise,” feel slightly overwritten. Streamlining these could sharpen the narrative’s impact.\n\n\nCharacter Development:\nThe protagonist’s moral journey is compelling, and supporting characters—Clara with her rosary, Eddie with his limp, Miles with his disillusionment—add layers to the story. Their struggles humanize the firm’s corruption. Yet, Miles’s despair (“I can’t do this anymore”) is stated rather than shown, weakening its effect. Subtle actions (e.g., trembling hands or a vacant stare) could convey this more powerfully.\n\n\nPlot and Pacing:\nThe tension builds well, culminating in the protagonist’s refusal to shred the evidence—a satisfying climax. The resolution, with sunlight breaking through, offers hope without feeling forced. However, the shift from indecision to action feels rushed. A deeper moment of reflection or a specific trigger could make the decision more earned.\n\n\nThemes and Message:\nThe exploration of integrity versus ambition in a corrupt system is thought-provoking and well-executed. The shadow figure’s ambiguity (conscience or specter?) adds intrigue, but its unclear role slightly dilutes the thematic cohesion. Linking it more directly to the firm’s sins or the protagonist’s choice would strengthen the message.\n\n\nWhy 80?\nThe story is engaging and well-written, but it occasionally tells instead of shows, and the pacing could be refined. Fully integrating the shadow and polishing the prose would elevate it further.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement\nHere are targeted ways to enhance the story, particularly by showing rather than telling:\n\n\nIntegrate the Supernatural More Seamlessly:\n\nCurrent Issue: The shadow figure feels peripheral to the plot.\nFix: Connect it to the firm’s dark history or the protagonist’s dilemma. For example, have it appear more intensely as the protagonist nears the shredder, perhaps whispering indistinct words tied to past cases (e.g., “benzene” or “guilty”). This makes it a gothic symbol of reckoning, not just a mysterious presence.\nExample Revision: Instead of “the shadow solidified, its form almost tangible, a silent accusation,” try: “The shadow loomed closer, its edges sharpening as I gripped the document, and a faint rasp—like a dying breath—echoed from the vents.”\n\n\n\nShow, Don’t Tell Character Emotions:\n\nCurrent Issue: Miles’s disillusionment is directly stated (“I can’t do this anymore”).\nFix: Replace dialogue with actions or imagery. Show his breaking point through physical cues or environment.\nExample Revision: Change “I can’t do this anymore,” he muttered, to “Miles’s highlighter slipped from his hand, streaking yellow across the desk, his eyes fixed on nothing as the screen’s glow drained his face pale.”\n\n\n\nEnhance Gothic Imagery in the Setting:\n\nCurrent Issue: The modern office lacks some gothic decay.\nFix: Add visual hints of moral rot to the pristine tower. Describe worn edges, eerie sounds, or a sense of the building “watching.”\nExample Revision: Expand “The office was a labyrinth of cubicles” to “The office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat.”\n\n\n\nDeepen the Protagonist’s Decision:\n\nCurrent Issue: The choice to defy Hargrove feels abrupt.\nFix: Build to it with a trigger or reflection. Perhaps the protagonist finds an old memo implicating the firm in harm, or recalls Eddie’s bitter smile, pushing them to act.\nExample Revision: Before “With a steady hand, I picked up the document,” add: “I glanced at Eddie’s cart rattling past, its wheels groaning like a plea, and the shadow flickered—closer, colder. The words of an old case file flashed in my mind: ‘Lives lost, profits gained.’ My pen stilled.”\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is a strong gothic story that weaves atmosphere, moral conflict, and vivid imagery into a modern corporate nightmare. It earns 85/100 for its gothic qualities, with a few tweaks needed to fully root it in the genre. As a narrative, it scores 80/100, offering a compelling read that could shine brighter with more subtlety and integration. By showing rather than telling and deepening its gothic elements, it could become an even more haunting tale. Well done!\n\ndraft with new plot line and assessment prompt\nThe Ledger\nRain fell in sheets as I crest the hill, February 24, 2025. The engine coughs, sputters, dies. Silence fills the car, broken only by me tightening my tie. I turn the key—nothing. The headlights flicker, then fade, leaving me in a gray haze. The mansion looms ahead, a shadow against the storm, its spires jagged as broken bones ( good but move it). Kessler, Hargrove &amp; Tate’s client, Mr. French, he is not french, waits inside. He summoned me here, urgent, no details—just an address and a time. I grab my briefcase, step out, and start the climb.\nThe path twists upward, slick with mud. My shoes sink, the hill’s air cold against my skin. The mansion’s facade sharpens: stone gargoyles perch on the eaves, their eyes hollow, mouths stretched wide. Ivy clings to the walls, tendrils thick as veins. I reach the door—black oak, brass knocker shaped like a ram’s skull—and it opens before I touch it. A butler, thin as a shadow, nods. “Mr. Vellum is expecting you.”\nHe leads me through halls draped in darkness, portraits of stern-faced men glaring from the walls, their eyes following my steps. We pass rooms, doors ajar—beyond one, a flicker of light, a sharp smell of formaldehyde and something sweeter, like decay. The butler pauses. “The laboratory, sir. Mr. Vellum’s… research.” I glance inside: glass jars line the shelves, each holding a shape—limbs, organs, suspended in amber liquid. On a table, an umbrella lies open, its canopy stitched from pale, translucent material that gleams wetly. Human skin, I realize. Beside it, a beaker bubbles, water swirling in a vortex, sand suspended in its center, defying gravity. Another jar holds grains of sand, shifting as if alive. I swallow, my throat dry.\nThe butler clears his throat. “This way, sir.” We continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. Inside, Mr. Vellum sits behind a mahogany desk, his face sharp, eyes gleaming like polished coins. “You’re late,” he says, voice smooth as oil. “But no matter. We have business.”\nHe slides a file across the desk—Case 19-45. “This needs to disappear. Permanently. Your firm’s handled such things before.” His gaze pins me, **a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing. “The contents are… sensitive. A competitor’s formula, acquired through unconventional means. And there’s another matter. My associate, exposed to the chemicals—she’s gone now. If this surfaces, we lose millions. You understand?”\nI nod, but my mind reels back—three days ago, orientation at Kessler, Hargrove &amp; Tate. The senior paralegal’s voice, flat as a deposition transcript: “Billable target’s 1,800 hours. Partners track the keycard logs.” Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings, her hands trembling. Eddie’s cart creaking, his hymn a dirge for his dreams. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a blade. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade before I’d applied. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed. (more)\nBack in Vellum’s office, the air thickens. “You’ll handle it?” he asks, leaning forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk. I see the lab again, the umbrella’s pale canopy, the water swirling, the sand shifting in its jar. Ghosts of the firm’s past whisper through the vents: Sign it. Bury it. Bill it. My pen hovers over the non-disclosure (????), the words blurring. “Yes,” I say, the syllable heavy as a stone.\nThe lights flicker, die. Darkness floods the room, thick as ink. Vellum’s voice cuts through: “Choose wisely.” When the lights return, he’s gone. Two doors stand before me, identical, both ajar. I pick the left, step through—and find myself outside, the rain now a drizzle, the hill’s air warm. My car waits, engine purring, headlights piercing the mist. I slide in, grip the wheel, and glance back. The mansion is gone, swallowed by fog, as if it never was.\nI drive away, the road unfurling like a lie. In the rearview mirror, something shifts—a shadow in the backseat, or perhaps just my reflection, hollow-eyed, forever changed. The ledger’s weight lingers, my name etched in its pages, and I wonder if I’ve buried the file or merely entombed myself deeper in the firm’s crypt. The rain resumes, harder now, drumming on the roof, and I press the gas, fleeing toward a dawn that may never come.\nTO LOYALTY"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Imagine/Alamont-and-Bergmann/Welcome-Second-Draft":{"title":"Welcome Second Draft","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"keep at like 1300-1500 words i guess\nYou find yourself in a place where you don’t think you will ever be in, but it does not feel totally unfamiliar.

You observe that he looks old, but stand straight, rigid, with purpose. You shake hands with him, his rough, patched hands gripping. firmly against your flimsy ones.

Dead rats, smelly rats, bulging rats, shrunk rats, lumped rats, alive rats, angry rats. You swallow, your throat dry.\nYou continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. My. Bayer goes to sit behind a mahogany desk, sleek, rectangular, the only piece of furniture that seemed to be up kept.\nHis face sharp, he slides a file across the desk—Case 16-08. “This needs to disappear.

The senior paralegal’s voice, flat as a deposition transcript: “Billable target’s 1,800 hours. Partners track the logs.” Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings. Eddie’s cart creaking, his hymn. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a blade. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade ago. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed.\n“Your cubicle is here. This is your in and out box, you will do the work in your in box and hand them in in your out box or directly to firm partners. You will do what you are told to. You will shred if asked to shred. You will come in after hours, overtime is not paid. You will not answer your phone if it rings past 6pm, let it roll to voicemail.”\nI nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge’s gavel.\nWe saw the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high, and he hummed a mournful tune. His limp was more pronounced today, he was respected, but he had fallen from a ladder. As he passed, he caught my eye and gave a small, bitter smile, his fingers drumming on the cart’s handle.\nThe office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat.\nClara sat nearby, shoulders tense, eyes fixed on a deposition transcript. Her fingers struck the keys with furious intensity, the scratching sound echoing in the quiet office. She didn’t glance my way, but I noticed the rosary beads wrapped around her wrist, the cross swaying with each movement. Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen with a worried frown. Her voice was weary even from afar, but there was steel in her gaze despite its cracks.\nDown the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, tie loose. His highlighter’s tip wobbled, then followed the upper part of the body, the highlighter slipped, but it brought his hand down with it, streaking yellow across the desk. His eyes did not waver though, it stayed fixed on his screen, as if it drained his face pale. Fixed. You hear a highlighter being dropped onto the floor. He then slowly, started turning clockwise, head followed by shoulder. What was he turning for. You observer that the turn lasted for 4 seconds, there was nothing behind him. He turned, his body sagged.\nThen, the senior suite. Victor Hargrove’s door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine’s edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief’s misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm’s predator. His desk held a Christmas basket, it was February, a card pinned beneath: “To loyalty.”  A specter from the ’80s benzene case, still lingering and welcomed here after half a century.\nAs you turned back to your desk, you caught a glimpse of movement in the window’s reflection—a tall, shadowy figure standing in your cubicle’s doorway. But when you spun around, there was nothing. Yet, the presence lingered, a whisper at the edge of your mind, watching. A cold draft, a flicker in the corner of your vision. Eddie’s hymn swelled.\nThat was orientation. She left you there, her voice trailing off: “Pace yourself. The clock’s ticking.”\nYou look at the document, your task two weeks later, today. It had no useful information, the file’s edges were rounded and creased though, suggesting it was full before.\nThe shadow loomed closer, its edges sharpening as I gripped the document, and a faint rasp—like a dying breath—echoed from the vents.\nBack in Bayers’s office, the air thickens. “You’ll handle it?” he asks, leaning forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk. I see the lab again, the umbrella’s pale canopy, the water swirling, the sand shifting in its jar. You remember what the shadow said, Sign it, bury it, bill it, and like hypnosis, your pen hovers, the words blurring. “Yes,” you say, the syllable spoken as light as a feather.\nThe lights flicker, die. Darkness floods the room, thick as ink. Bayer’s voice cuts through: “Choose wisely.” When the lights return, he’s gone. Two doors stand before me, identical, both ajar. You pick the left door and step through—and find myself outside, the two doors lead to the same spot. The rain starts to drizzle, the hill’s air warm. My car waits, engine purring, headlights piercing the mist. I slide in, grip the wheel, and glance back. Fog arose. You drive away, the road unfurling like a lie.\nIn the rearview mirror, something shifts—a shadow in the backseat, or perhaps just my reflection, hollow-eyed, forever changed.  The rain resumes, harder now, drumming on the roof, and I press the gas, fleeing toward a dawn that may never come.\nYou remember seeing Eddie’s cart rattling past, his dreams buried within the documents; Clara’s rosary swinging, like a grandfather clock; Miles’s grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove’s laugh echoes down, sharp as a tool, and the ledger’s shadow stretches long, your name carved in its depths.\nThat was fast, and short, you think. You don’t hear, but feel the whisper now. Good job. Welcome to Alamont &amp; Bergmann, do your job now."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/Writing/to-Imagine/Alamont-and-Bergmann/Welcome-Third-Draft":{"title":"Welcome Third Draft","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The rain smeared Alamont &amp; Bergmann’s tower into a watercolor of dread, its windows streaked like the veins of some leviathan rising from the city’s underbelly.

You’d heard the name in whispers—the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash-filled suitcases. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.”\nThe Descent\nThe hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. When your car choked to death at the base, you understood why associates vanished after these visits. No Ubers in purgatory.\nThe mansion wasn’t architecture—it was a tumor. Limestone walls bulged as if something pulsed beneath, ivy strangling the cracks like sutures. Gargoyles perched above the door, their mouths agape in silent screams, rainwater pooling in their hollow eyes. You counted six before the door creaked open.\nBayer stood framed in the threshold, a cadaver in a three-piece suit. His skin hung too tight over the bones, as if starched. When you shook his hand, the texture shocked you—not flesh, but cured leather, the kind used to bind forbidden ledgers.\n“Follow,” he rasped, turning without checking if you obeyed.\nThe foyer swallowed light. Dust sheets draped furniture into ghostly shapes, and the floorboards groaned like old gallows. Portraits lined the walls—Bayer ancestors with eyes blackened by time, their stares needling your spine. You passed a half-open door.\nDon’t look.\nYou looked.\nThe laboratory stank of formaldehyde and rotting pears. Shelves sagged under jars of amber liquid, each housing horrors: rats with human teeth, their bodies split open to reveal coiled viscera; a fetus floating mid-transformation, half-rodent, half-infant. On the floor, umbrellas lay splayed like skinned bats, their canopies translucent—membrane, you realized, stomach lurching. Human epidermis stretched over wire ribs.\nBayer didn’t pause. “A hobby,” he said, as a centrifuge hummed in the corner, spinning vials of murky fluid.\nThe Transaction\nHis office was a sarcophagus. The mahogany desk gleamed under a single pendant light, its surface barren except for a rotary phone and a jar of peppermints that might’ve been decades old. He slid the file toward you.\n“Disappear this. Permanently.”\nThe pages were blank.\nNo—not blank. You tilted them toward the light and saw the indentations, the ghost of text pressed into the paper by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: Lena Voss, 34, exposure event.\n“My competitor’s research,” Bayer said, fingers steepled. “And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” His voice softened, a scalpel sheathed in velvet. “Your firm excels at… cleanup. Bill it as document review.”\nYour tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth. Two weeks earlier, they’d shown you the shredder room—industrial-grade, capable of pulverizing cement. “Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,” Hargrove had smirked, patting the machine like a beloved hound.\n\nThe Firm’s Teeth\nMemories bled into the present:\nClara at 2 AM, hunched over discovery documents, her rosary beads click-clacking like a deathwatch beetle. “They promoted Miles after the Brighton case,” she’d muttered, highlighter trembling over a deposition. “He found the loophole. The family couldn’t sue after… the accident.”\nEddie the mail clerk, limping past your desk, his cart overflowing with envelopes stamped CONFIDENTIAL. He’d paused, fixing you with milky eyes. “Watch the clocks here. They run backward sometimes.”\nHargrove’s laugh sawing through the floorboards, his office a glass-walled vault. “We’re not butchers,” he’d told you during orientation, straightening a framed photo of himself shaking hands with a senator. “We’re surgeons. Society needs its tumors cut out.”\nNow, in Bayer’s tomb, the shadows thickened. The pendant light flickered.\n“Well?” Bayer’s jaw unhinged slightly, too wide for a human smile.\nYou reached for your pen. The firm’s motto throbbed in your skull: Sign it, bill it, bury it.\nThe lights died.\n\nThe Choice\nWhen they sputtered back on, Bayer was gone. Two doors materialized in the far wall, both ajar. Through the left—moonlight, rain, your idling car. Through the right—a corridor lined with more doors, each numbered 16-08.\nYou chose the left.\nThe hill’s air now reeked of burnt sugar. Your car started instantly, the radio whispering static. As you reversed, the mansion’s windows flashed—figures pressed against the glass, their palms leaving smears. One resembled Lena Voss’s employee badge photo. Another, Eddie.\nThe road unspooled into the city’s glow. In the rearview, your reflection wavered—eyes hollow, hair streaked white. The file sat beside you, its pages now visible:\nLena Voss v. Bayer Chemical.\nCause of death: acute exposure to Compound 16-08. Symptoms: epidermal shedding, ocular hemorrhage, vocal cord liquefaction.\nRecommended action: settlement via non-disclosure. Client requests all biological remains incinerated.\nBeneath, a sticky note in Hargrove’s jagged script: “Burn after reading. Welcome to the team.”\n\nEpilogue: The Clocktower\nBack at Alamont &amp; Bergmann, the night shift toiled under flickering fluorescents. Clara’s rosary beads were gone, her wrist ringed with fresh burns. Eddie’s cart now carried a jar of peppermints.\nYou shredded Lena’s file, the machine screaming like a living thing.\nAt 3:33 AM, your phone buzzed—a client alert. Case 16-08 closed. 15.0 billable hours logged.\nOutside your cubicle, a shadow coalesced. Tall, slender, its edges bleeding into the dark. You didn’t turn. You knew better now.\nThe firm had many teeth. You were simply the latest.\nRain lashed the windows as you typed, the keys clattering like bones. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, hungry again.\n\ntwo\nTHE LEDGER’S WHISPER\n(A Gothic Revision)\nThe rain bled down Alamont &amp; Bergmann’s tower, warping the skyline into a watercolor of dread. Your new cubicle smelled of lemon polish and decay—two weeks in this sepulcher of billable hours, yet the air still carried the iron tang of something long entombed. Across the window, a rivulet traced the path of a tear down darkened glass.\nSix figures. That’s what they’d promised. Enough to choke your student loans into silence. You hadn’t asked why the previous associate’s name was scrubbed from the doorplate, nor why the ledger in HR bore your signature dated 2015—ten years before you’d stumbled into this interview. “Scrivener’s error,” the administrator had smiled, nail tapping the smudged ink. Her reflection in the window that day had shown no one behind her desk.\n\nThe Summons\nThe partner’s voice still claws at your spine: “Mr. Bayer’s estate. 4PM. Do try not to disappoint us.” Colleagues raised their heads as you stood—a jury of specters in pinstripes. Clara’s rosary beads clicked like counting bones. Eddie’s mail cart creaked a dirge. None wished you luck.\nRain died as your company sedan coughed itself still beneath the hill. The mansion above floated on a miasma of mist, its limestone façade pockmarked like an acid-eaten skull. Ivy slithered across the walls, glistening. Halfway up the path, your polished Oxfords sank into the earth as if the ground itself resisted your approach. Above the door, a gargoyle’s chiseled scream watched you through hollow eyes.\nThe knob turned before your touch.\n“Punctual.” Mr. Bayer stood framed in the threshold, his grip crushing your fingers to chalk. “We value that here.” His laboratory stank of formaldehyde and burnt sugar. Through an ajar door, glass jars bubbled—one held a rat mid-transformation, fur replaced by glistening scales. Another contained what might have been a human tongue floating in ambergris. You counted seventeen open umbrellas on the floor, their canopies stretched taut like preserved skin.\nHis study swallowed sound. The mahogany desk gleamed with oiled malevolence as he slid Case 16-08 toward you. “A competitor’s formula. My former associate…overly curious. You’ll find her objections withdrawn.” His smile revealed teeth filed to points. “Alamont’s usual methods should suffice.”\nThe file weighed nothing. It burned nothing. Yet your palms blistered.\n\nThe Firm’s Teeth\nOrientation returned to you then—the way Hargrove had materialized behind your chair, breath reeking of single malt and sealed settlements. “That ledger binds you,” he’d whispered. “We all sign twice here—once in ink, once in blood.”\nYou’d laughed nervously until noticing Miles across the hall. The junior partner sat frozen before his monitor, highlighter trembling in a hand gone translucent. His head swiveled 180 degrees with the creak of overstressed vertebrae, mouthing “Run” before snapping back to his deposition.\nNow, in Bayer’s choking silence, you understood. The formula in your hands wasn’t corporate espionage—it was alchemy. The rats in jars weren’t experiments. They were witnesses.\nThe lights died.\nWhen they flickered back, two doors stood where Bayer had been. From the left came Clara’s rosary clatter. From the right, Eddie’s hymn. Your pen moved without consent, the signature blooming on the document like an infection.\n\nThe Road From the Hill\nYour car waited obediently, engine purring. The rearview mirror showed only fog until mile three—then the silhouette emerged. Not Bayer. Not Hargrove. A thing with too many joints folded into the backseat, its breath frosting glass.\n“Well negotiated,” it rasped. The voice held Clara’s grief and Miles’s broken laugh. “Shall we discuss your billing quota?”\nRain hammered the windshield as Alamont’s tower reappeared—a monolith growing teeth against the storm. Eddie stood in the lobby, his mail cart overflowing with sealed urns. He nodded as you passed, humming a hymn you now recognized as a requiem.\nAt your desk, the ledger lay open. Your 2015 signature glistened fresh, below it a new entry: Case 16-08 - Disposition: Permanent Silence. Client Satisfaction: 94%. Associate Compliance: Verified.\nThe shadow in your cubicle doorway applauded softly.\n\nKey Revisions:\n\nTemporal Anchors\n\n\n\nLedger’s 2015 signature framed as supernatural contract rather than error\n\n\nClient’s “formula” tied to alchemical transformation of witnesses\n\n\n\nCompressed Symbolism\n\n\n\nBayer’s lab distilled to essential horrors (transmuted rats, skin umbrellas)\n\n\nMerged orientation flashbacks with present dread during mansion sequence\n\n\n\nHeightened Stakes\n\n\n\nCompliance directly linked to physical metamorphosis (Miles’s turning, translucent skin)\n\n\nFirm’s true product revealed as “silence” commodified\n\n\n\nAmbiguous Antagonist\n\n\n\nThe shadow/shape-shifting entity represents collective corruption\n\n\nFinal compliance percentage hints at grading system with lethal consequences\n\n\n\nGothic Motifs\n\n\n\nRecurrent water imagery (tears, rain, preservative fluids) mirror moral erosion\n\n\nArchitecture as antagonist (firm’s tower, mansion’s hungry hill)\n\n\nWord count: 1470.

Priestley skillfully constructs a sense of mystery and intrigue from the very beginning of the play, setting the stage for the dramatic revelations to come. Set in 1912, the play begins with the seemingly happy and celebratory Birling family dinner, but from the opening scenes, there are subtle hints that all is not as it seems. Written in 1945, the play reflects Priestley’s interest in social responsibility and moral reckoning, with the mysterious Inspector Goole acting as the catalyst for the family’s downfall. Priestley builds a sense of mystery in the opening scenes through the use of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, and the sudden and enigmatic arrival of the Inspector. This essay will explore how Priestley uses these techniques to create suspense and anticipation, drawing the audience into the unfolding mystery.\nThe play opens with the Birling family and Gerald Croft enjoying a celebratory dinner in honor of Sheila and Gerald’s engagement. On the surface, everything appears perfect, with Mr. Birling confidently discussing the bright future ahead for both his family and his business. However, Priestley introduces dramatic irony to create a sense of unease and hint at the underlying tension. Mr. Birling’s confident assertions about the impossibility of war and the unsinkable nature of the Titanic are knowingly false to the audience, who, in 1945, are well aware of the catastrophic events that followed in the years after 1912. This use of dramatic irony immediately suggests that Mr. Birling’s worldview is flawed, creating a sense that something is about to disrupt the family’s complacent happiness. The tension between the appearance of harmony and the audience’s knowledge that these predictions are wrong begins to build the mystery, as we are left wondering what will happen to challenge the Birling family’s seemingly perfect world.\nPriestley also builds mystery through the use of foreshadowing in the early scenes, particularly in the subtle tensions between the characters. Sheila’s playful teasing of Gerald about his absence the previous summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—introduces an undercurrent of suspicion. Although the family seems happy, there are hints that all is not as harmonious as it appears. Sheila’s suspicions about Gerald, coupled with Eric’s awkward behavior and heavy drinking, suggest that there are secrets waiting to be uncovered. Priestley plants these small seeds of doubt to build a sense of anticipation in the audience. These moments of tension create a feeling that something is being concealed, and the audience is left wondering what lies beneath the surface. This sense of hidden truths is crucial to the play’s development, as the Inspector’s later revelations will expose the moral failings of each character.\nThe mystery in the opening scenes is heightened by the sudden and unexplained arrival of Inspector Goole. His arrival is marked by a shift in the atmosphere; Priestley’s stage directions describe him as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness.” This description contrasts with the earlier lighthearted and celebratory mood, signaling to the audience that the Inspector brings with him a serious and unsettling presence. Priestley uses timing to build suspense, as the Inspector’s arrival interrupts Mr. Birling’s speech about individual responsibility, immediately challenging the values the family holds dear. The Inspector’s cryptic behavior and methodical questioning add to the sense of mystery—he appears to know more than he lets on, and his inquiries seem to suggest that the Birlings are connected to a much larger and darker story than they realize. His authority, combined with his vague and unsettling manner, builds tension as the audience is drawn into the mystery of who Inspector Goole really is and what he has come to reveal.\nIn the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley builds a strong sense of mystery through the use of dramatic irony, foreshadowing, and the sudden arrival of the enigmatic Inspector Goole. The contrast between the family’s superficial celebration and the underlying tension in their relationships hints at hidden secrets, while the Inspector’s presence immediately disrupts their comfortable world. Priestley uses these techniques to create suspense and anticipation, drawing the audience into the mystery of the Birlings’ connection to Eva Smith’s tragic death. This early sense of mystery is central to the play’s structure, as it sets the stage for the moral reckoning and dramatic revelations that will follow, reinforcing the play’s broader themes of responsibility, guilt, and the consequences of unchecked privilege."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-introduce-the-theme-of-responsibility-in-the-early":{"title":"How does Priestley introduce the theme of responsibility in the early","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley uses the theme of responsibility to critique the social attitudes of Edwardian Britain, particularly the upper classes’ lack of concern for the welfare of others. The play, set in 1912, reflects the rigid class structures of the time, but Priestley wrote it in 1945, following the devastation of two world wars and the rise of socialist ideals. In the early part of the play, Priestley begins to introduce the theme of responsibility by contrasting the selfish individualism of Mr. Birling with the growing moral awareness of characters like Sheila and Eric. Through dialogue, characterisation, and the dramatic entrance of Inspector Goole, Priestley gradually builds the audience’s awareness of how personal actions can have far-reaching consequences, especially for the vulnerable in society. This essay will explore how Priestley introduces the theme of responsibility, focusing on Mr. Birling’s rejection of it, the Inspector’s arrival, and the seeds of self-awareness planted in the younger generation.\nIn the early scenes of the play, Mr. Birling’s speeches reveal his staunch rejection of social responsibility. As a prosperous businessman, he embodies capitalist individualism, believing that success is the result of personal effort and that the well-being of others is not his concern. He famously declares, “A man has to mind his own business and look after himself and his own.” Priestley uses rhetoric here to emphasize Birling’s selfish worldview, which prioritizes profit and personal success over collective well-being. This statement is crucial in establishing the central conflict of the play: the clash between individualism and social responsibility. Mr. Birling’s disdain for the idea of collective responsibility is also reflected in his dismissive attitude towards the potential for social unrest, as he confidently dismisses the possibility of strikes and war. Through Birling’s character, Priestley critiques the capitalist class, who, in their pursuit of profit, ignore the consequences of their actions on the working class. Birling’s rejection of responsibility contrasts sharply with the moral message that Priestley will later deliver through the Inspector, foreshadowing the confrontation between the two worldviews.\nThe theme of responsibility takes on a new dimension with the arrival of Inspector Goole. His entrance, described in the stage directions as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness,” marks a dramatic shift in tone. The Inspector’s role is to challenge the characters’ views on responsibility, particularly those of Mr. Birling. One of the first things the Inspector says is, “what happened to her may have determined what happened to her afterwards,” introducing the idea that actions are interconnected and that individual choices can have significant consequences for others. Priestley uses dialogue to emphasize the Inspector’s moral authority, positioning him as a vehicle for Priestley’s own socialist beliefs about collective responsibility. The Inspector’s interrogation style is deliberate and methodical, forcing the Birlings to confront the impact of their actions on Eva Smith. His questioning exposes how each family member contributed to Eva’s downfall, reinforcing the play’s central message that everyone bears some responsibility for the well-being of others. Priestley’s use of the Inspector as a moral figure challenges the audience to reflect on their own responsibilities in society, aligning with the play’s broader critique of individualism and selfishness.\nWhile Mr. Birling stubbornly rejects any notion of responsibility, Priestley begins to plant seeds of self-awareness in the younger generation, particularly Sheila and Eric. Sheila’s response to the news of Eva Smith’s death shows a stark contrast to her father’s indifference. She immediately expresses guilt for her role in Eva’s firing, saying, “But these girls aren’t cheap labour—they’re people.” Priestley uses characterisation here to present Sheila as a more empathetic and socially aware figure, reflecting the younger generation’s potential to embrace social responsibility. Eric, too, shows signs of discomfort, though his guilt and unease are initially expressed through awkward behavior rather than direct statements. The growing divide between the younger and older generations foreshadows the conflict that will unfold as the play progresses. Priestley uses this generational conflict to suggest that hope for a more responsible society lies with the younger generation, who are more open to acknowledging their moral obligations to others. This idea resonates with the post-war audience, who were grappling with the need for social change and collective responsibility in the wake of the destruction caused by two world wars.\nIn the early part of An Inspector Calls, Priestley introduces the theme of responsibility through the contrasting attitudes of the characters and the arrival of Inspector Goole. Mr. Birling’s rejection of responsibility reflects the selfish individualism of the capitalist class, while the Inspector’s questioning challenges this worldview by emphasizing the interconnectedness of human actions and their consequences. The seeds of self-awareness planted in Sheila and Eric suggest that the younger generation has the potential to embrace social responsibility, offering hope for a more compassionate and just society.

Set in 1912, a time of rigid class distinctions and capitalist dominance, the play critiques the complacency and selfishness of the upper classes. Written in 1945, following two world wars and the rise of socialism, the play reflects Priestley’s desire for social change. In the opening scenes, Priestley introduces the Birling family as a unit defined by hierarchy, self-interest, and generational conflict. Through their interactions, Priestley sets the stage for a critique of the power dynamics and moral complacency that characterize both the family and the wider society they represent. This essay will explore how Priestley presents the Birling family dynamics, focusing on the authority of Mr. Birling, the passivity of Mrs. Birling, and the tension between the younger and older generations.\nAt the start of the play, Mr. Birling is presented as the dominant figure in the family, reflecting the patriarchal nature of upper-class society at the time. His speeches are long and authoritative, with him often speaking over or for the other family members, especially Sheila and Eric. For example, when discussing the engagement with Gerald, he emphasizes how this marriage benefits his business and social standing, stating, “your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me.” Here, Priestley uses dialogue to emphasize Mr. Birling’s view of relationships as transactional, where personal connections serve to reinforce business alliances. His need to assert control is evident in his monologues about the future, where he confidently dismisses the possibility of war and social unrest. Through dramatic irony, the audience knows that Mr. Birling’s predictions are wrong, which undermines his authority and exposes his ignorance. His dominance within the family reflects a broader critique of capitalist patriarchy, where wealth and status are prioritized over emotional or moral considerations. This dynamic sets the tone for the family’s relationships, where Mr. Birling’s views often go unchallenged—at least at first.\nMrs. Birling’s role in the family dynamics is characterized by passivity and complicity. She supports and upholds her husband’s authority, reinforcing the traditional gender roles expected of women in upper-class society. Mrs. Birling’s silence during Mr. Birling’s lengthy speeches in the opening scenes suggests her acceptance of her secondary role, which is reflective of the patriarchal expectations of the time. However, when she does speak, she reveals her own sense of superiority and entitlement, particularly regarding social class. For instance, she chastises Sheila for not behaving like “the daughter of a good customer,” highlighting her concern with appearances and status. Priestley uses characterisation to portray Mrs. Birling as a woman whose identity is deeply tied to the family’s social position, and who, like her husband, is blind to the struggles of the working class. Her passive role in the family dynamics reflects the broader theme of class privilege, where her moral complacency allows her to ignore the consequences of her actions, particularly towards Eva Smith. This complicity aligns her with her husband’s worldview, creating a unified front of upper-class entitlement.\nOne of the key dynamics within the Birling family is the tension between the younger and older generations, particularly between Mr. and Mrs. Birling and their children, Sheila and Eric. Early in the play, this tension is subtle but significant, foreshadowing the conflicts that will emerge later. While Sheila initially appears to conform to her parents’ expectations, there are hints that she is more self-aware and open to change. For example, she expresses guilt over her treatment of Eva Smith, saying, “But these girls aren’t cheap labor—they’re people.” Priestley uses dialogue here to highlight the differences in perspective between Sheila and her parents, with Sheila showing an emerging social conscience that contrasts with her parents’ indifference. Eric, too, is presented as uneasy, though less vocal than Sheila in the opening scenes. His drinking and awkward behavior suggest deeper issues with the family’s values, hinting at his dissatisfaction with his parents’ worldview. This generational divide reflects one of the play’s central themes—the possibility of social change—as the younger generation begins to question the values of their parents and the society they represent. Priestley uses this tension to suggest that hope for a more just and responsible society lies with the younger generation, who are more open to self-reflection and change.\nIn the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents the Birling family dynamics as hierarchical and defined by self-interest, with Mr. Birling assuming a dominant role and Mrs. Birling complicit in upholding traditional gender and class structures. The tension between the younger and older generations foreshadows the moral reckoning that will unfold throughout the play, as Sheila and Eric begin to challenge their parents’ complacency. Through these dynamics, Priestley critiques the rigid class divisions and patriarchal authority that characterized Edwardian society, while also suggesting that the potential for social change lies with the younger generation. In both the context of 1945 and in modern times, Priestley’s portrayal of the Birling family remains a powerful reflection on the need for collective responsibility and social reform."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-present-the-theme-of-generational-conflict-between-Sheila-and-her-parents-in-the-early-scenes":{"title":"How does Priestley present the theme of generational conflict between Sheila and her parents in the early scenes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley explores the theme of generational conflict to highlight the differing values and attitudes between the younger and older generations. Set in 1912, but written in 1945, the play reflects Priestley’s desire for social change and critiques the rigid class divisions and capitalist ideologies of the early 20th century. The older generation, represented by Mr. and Mrs. Birling, is shown to be entrenched in self-interest, status, and individualism, while the younger generation, particularly Sheila, begins to challenge these traditional values. Priestley uses the tension between Sheila and her parents in the early scenes to reveal this conflict, illustrating how the younger generation is more open to change and self-reflection. This essay will explore how Priestley presents this theme through Sheila’s growing moral awareness, her rejection of her parents’ capitalist attitudes, and the subtle but growing tension in her interactions with them.\nIn the early scenes, Priestley presents Sheila as a character who is beginning to develop a social conscience, contrasting sharply with her parents’ self-interest. After learning about the sacking of Eva Smith, Sheila shows immediate remorse and empathy, saying, “But these girls aren’t cheap labour—they’re people.” Here, Priestley uses dialogue to highlight the emerging conflict between Sheila and her parents. Sheila’s words demonstrate her ability to see the humanity in Eva, while her father, Mr. Birling, views Eva and other workers purely in terms of profit. Mr. Birling’s earlier assertion that “a man has to mind his own business and look after himself” encapsulates the older generation’s capitalist mindset, which prioritizes wealth and power over social responsibility. Priestley uses this contrast to emphasize the growing division between Sheila and her parents. Sheila’s moral awakening, shown in her guilt and empathy, marks her as a member of the younger generation who is capable of change, while her parents remain entrenched in their capitalist values. This tension reflects the broader theme of generational conflict, with Priestley suggesting that the future lies with the younger generation’s ability to embrace social responsibility.\nAs the play progresses, Sheila’s rejection of her parents’ attitudes becomes more explicit, particularly in her interactions with Mr. Birling. While Mr. Birling celebrates the engagement as a business alliance with Gerald’s family, Sheila’s focus is on the emotional and moral aspects of their relationship. Sheila’s rejection of her father’s materialistic worldview is evident when she questions Gerald’s behavior during the summer, hinting at her awareness of deeper issues in their relationship beyond the superficial aspects Mr. Birling values. Priestley uses characterisation to contrast Sheila’s growing independence with Mr. Birling’s rigid views. Sheila’s willingness to challenge both her father and Gerald reflects her desire for authenticity and honesty, as opposed to the transactional nature of relationships that her parents promote. This conflict underscores the generational divide, with Sheila representing the possibility of moving beyond the class-based, capitalist structures that her parents embody. Through Sheila, Priestley critiques the older generation’s blind faith in capitalism and suggests that the younger generation has the potential to adopt a more compassionate and responsible worldview.\nPriestley also introduces generational conflict between Sheila and her mother, Mrs. Birling, though in the early scenes, this tension is subtler than with Mr. Birling. Mrs. Birling is portrayed as a staunch defender of class divisions and social hierarchy, particularly in her dismissive attitude toward Eva Smith. When discussing Eva, Mrs. Birling refers to her as “a girl of that class,” emphasizing her belief that people of lower status are undeserving of help or compassion. Sheila, on the other hand, begins to distance herself from her mother’s attitudes, questioning her judgment and showing signs of empathy for Eva. The use of dramatic tension between the two women foreshadows the larger conflict that will develop as the Inspector’s questioning continues. Sheila’s moral growth contrasts sharply with Mrs. Birling’s rigid adherence to class distinctions, creating a generational divide that reflects the broader societal changes that Priestley advocates for. This conflict also highlights the theme of social responsibility, as Sheila begins to embrace the Inspector’s message of collective accountability, while her mother remains blind to her own culpability. Priestley uses this tension to underscore the need for change and progress, which he sees as being driven by the younger generation.\nIn the early scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents the theme of generational conflict primarily through the character of Sheila, whose growing moral awareness and empathy set her apart from her parents’ self-interest and capitalist attitudes. Sheila’s rejection of her father’s materialism and her developing sense of responsibility for others create a clear divide between the younger and older generations. The tension between Sheila and Mrs. Birling, though subtler at first, also reflects this generational divide, with Sheila beginning to challenge the class prejudices her mother holds dear. Through this conflict, Priestley critiques the complacency and moral failings of the older generation and suggests that the hope for a more just and compassionate society lies with the younger generation. This message, which resonated strongly in the post-war context of 1945, remains relevant today as society continues to grapple with issues of inequality, responsibility, and social change."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-use-dramatic-irony-to-present-Mr.-Birling’s-views-at-the-start-of-the-play":{"title":"How does Priestley use dramatic irony to present Mr. Birling’s views at the start of the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley sets his play in 1912, a pivotal moment in history, just before the Titanic sank and World War I began. This period was marked by rigid class structures, the dominance of capitalist ideologies, and stark social inequality. Written in 1945, after World War II, the play reflects Priestley’s socialist beliefs and critiques the attitudes of the upper class in Edwardian society. One of the ways Priestley conveys his social and political message is through the character of Mr. Birling, a self-assured businessman whose confidence in his views is exposed as flawed through the use of dramatic irony. Through Mr. Birling’s erroneous predictions and overconfidence, Priestley critiques capitalist individualism, arrogance, and the refusal to accept social responsibility. This essay will explore how Priestley uses dramatic irony to present Mr. Birling as a misguided and ignorant character, ultimately highlighting the dangers of such views.\nIn Act 1, Mr. Birling confidently dismisses the possibility of war, proclaiming, “The Germans don’t want war. Nobody wants war.” Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here is immediately evident, as the audience, living in the aftermath of two world wars, knows that Birling’s assertion is disastrously wrong. This technique exposes Birling’s ignorance and overconfidence in his understanding of global affairs. Priestley uses this irony to mock Birling’s blind faith in capitalist progress and to critique figures of authority who, like Birling, are overly confident in their flawed beliefs. Birling’s complacency in the face of looming disaster serves as a critique of the upper class, who, in their wealth and comfort, are disconnected from the realities of the world. This also connects to one of the play’s central themes—social responsibility—as Birling’s refusal to foresee war mirrors his refusal to acknowledge his own responsibility for others, a critique Priestley uses to highlight the moral failings of the capitalist class.\nMr. Birling’s infamous declaration that the Titanic is “unsinkable, absolutely unsinkable” is one of the most potent examples of dramatic irony in the play. The audience, with the benefit of hindsight, knows that the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage, making Birling’s statement not only wrong but tragically ironic. Priestley uses symbolism here, with the Titanic representing capitalist hubris—the belief that human achievement, particularly technological and economic progress, is infallible. Birling’s faith in the Titanic mirrors his faith in capitalism and the social order, both of which Priestley suggests are flawed and destined for collapse. The dramatic irony here serves to undermine Birling’s authority, casting doubt on his other views, particularly his rejection of the need for social change. By linking Birling’s confidence in the Titanic to his broader worldview, Priestley critiques the arrogance of the ruling class and their failure to recognize the need for greater social responsibility and equality, which resonates with both the play’s 1945 audience and modern audiences today.\nAnother example of dramatic irony is found in Mr. Birling’s dismissal of the idea that the world is on the brink of change. He states, “We’re in for a time of steadily increasing prosperity,” and confidently predicts that strikes and social unrest are unlikely. Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here reflects the audience’s awareness that the period following 1912 was marked by not only war but also significant social change, including the rise of labor movements and the eventual decline of rigid class structures. By presenting Birling as utterly blind to these changes, Priestley critiques his refusal to acknowledge the social inequalities and injustices that are soon to lead to major upheavals. This connects to the play’s broader theme of social responsibility, as Birling’s refusal to accept the possibility of change mirrors his failure to see the necessity of improving conditions for the working class. Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here highlights the dangers of ignorance and complacency among the upper classes. Birling’s blindness to the inevitable social shifts reflects his lack of empathy and understanding for the struggles of the working class, represented by characters like Eva Smith. Priestley uses this to underscore the play’s central message: the need for social responsibility and collective action. By showing how Birling’s predictions about prosperity and stability are proven wrong, Priestley critiques the arrogance of those in power who believe that the status quo will last indefinitely, while ignoring the growing demands for social justice.\nThrough the use of dramatic irony, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of capitalist arrogance and ignorance, whose flawed views reflect the broader failures of the ruling class in Edwardian society. By having Birling confidently make statements that the audience knows to be false, Priestley exposes the limitations of capitalist individualism and the dangers of dismissing social responsibility. Mr. Birling’s misguided confidence serves as a warning about the consequences of ignoring social change and the needs of the working class. Priestley’s message is as relevant today as it was in 1945: progress and prosperity are not sustainable unless society is built on fairness, empathy, and collective responsibility."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-is-the-theme-of-social-class-introduced-in-the-opening-scenes-of-the-play":{"title":"How is the theme of social class introduced in the opening scenes of the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley explores the deep divisions within Edwardian society, focusing on social class, inequality, and responsibility. Set in 1912, a time of rigid social hierarchy and entrenched class distinctions, the play critiques the complacency and moral failings of the upper classes. Written in 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, Priestley’s play reflects his socialist ideals and calls for a more just and equal society. In the opening scenes, the theme of social class is introduced through the interactions and attitudes of the Birling family and Gerald Croft, as well as the setting and tone of the play. Priestley uses these elements to reveal the deep-seated class prejudice and the entitlement of the upper class, while also foreshadowing the central conflict between individualism and social responsibility. This essay will explore how Priestley introduces the theme of social class in the early scenes through the characters’ language, the symbolism of the setting, and the underlying tensions between the upper and lower classes.\nFrom the outset, Priestley presents the Birling family and Gerald Croft as symbols of upper-class privilege and entitlement. Mr. Birling is a prosperous businessman, and the family’s wealth and status are made clear through their lifestyle. The description of the family home as “substantial and heavily comfortable, but not cosy or homelike” reflects the Birlings’ social position—focused on material success rather than emotional warmth or genuine connection. Priestley’s use of stage directions here is crucial, as the setting itself becomes a reflection of the family’s social standing. The lavish surroundings reinforce the Birlings’ detachment from the struggles of the working class, who are represented by characters like Eva Smith. The comfortable environment also suggests the Birlings’ sense of security and superiority, believing their wealth protects them from any societal challenges. This sense of entitlement is directly linked to the play’s theme of social class, as Priestley critiques the complacency and self-satisfaction of the upper classes, who view their status as both deserved and unassailable.\nMr. Birling’s speeches in the opening scenes provide a clear representation of his capitalist ideology and class prejudice. He speaks with pride about his rise in society, stating, “I speak as a hard-headed businessman,” and boasts about the success of his company. Birling’s obsession with profit and his dismissive attitude toward the working class are evident when he justifies firing Eva Smith for asking for a raise, arguing that if he had given in, “they’d soon be asking for the earth.” This reflects Birling’s belief that the lower classes are not entitled to any more than they are given, and that social progress or equality is a threat to his business. Priestley uses rhetoric here to reveal Birling’s complete disregard for the welfare of his workers, positioning him as a representative of the capitalist class. Birling’s views reinforce the stark class divisions in Edwardian society, where the wealthy few held power over the many. This links to the play’s broader critique of the upper class and their failure to take responsibility for the welfare of others. Priestley’s portrayal of Birling serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked capitalism and the moral bankruptcy of those who prioritize profit over people.\nGerald Croft’s engagement to Sheila Birling introduces another aspect of the theme of social class: the role of marriage in reinforcing class divisions. Gerald, the son of a wealthy industrialist, represents an even higher social class than the Birlings. Mr. Birling is eager to align his family with the Crofts through the marriage, describing the engagement as a “business deal” that will strengthen ties between their companies. This emphasis on the economic benefits of the marriage rather than genuine love reflects the way the upper class uses marriage to consolidate wealth and power. Priestley uses dialogue between the characters to highlight the transactional nature of such relationships, revealing how the upper classes maintain their privileged positions by marrying within their own social circle. Gerald’s higher social standing also creates tension within the Birling family, as Sheila’s excitement about the engagement is tempered by her suspicion of Gerald’s behavior, which later reveals his affair with Eva Smith. This affair further underscores the exploitation of the working class by the upper class, as Gerald’s actions show a disregard for Eva’s wellbeing. Priestley’s critique of class is thus woven into the personal dynamics of the characters, illustrating how social divisions permeate all aspects of life.\nIn the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley introduces the theme of social class through the portrayal of the Birling family and Gerald Croft, their attitudes towards wealth and status, and their interactions with each other. The setting, dialogue, and characterisation all serve to highlight the stark divisions between the upper and lower classes, as well as the complacency and entitlement of the wealthy. Priestley uses these early scenes to establish the social context of the play, setting the stage for the Inspector’s interrogation, which will challenge the characters’ views on class and responsibility. Through his critique of class privilege, Priestley calls for a more equal and compassionate society, a message that resonates as much today as it did in 1945."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/In-what-ways-does-Priestley-explore-the-theme-of-gender-roles-in-the-early-part-of-the-play":{"title":"In what ways does Priestley explore the theme of gender roles in the early part of the play?","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley critiques the rigid gender roles that were entrenched in Edwardian society in 1912, the period in which the play is set. Although the play was written in 1945, when ideas about women’s rights were beginning to shift, the gender norms of the early 20th century were still highly restrictive. Priestley uses the characters of Sheila Birling, Mrs. Birling, and Gerald Croft to explore how women were expected to adhere to passive, submissive roles, while men were afforded power, authority, and independence. Through these characters and their interactions, Priestley critiques the unequal treatment of women in both domestic and social spheres, while also suggesting the possibility of change through Sheila’s growing independence. This essay will explore how Priestley presents gender roles in the early part of the play, focusing on the patriarchal control exercised by men, the limited roles of women, and the subtle challenges to these traditional gender expectations.\nIn the opening scenes, Priestley presents a clear hierarchy of power within the Birling family, with men holding authority and women expected to remain submissive. Mr. Birling is portrayed as the dominant figure in the household, making lengthy speeches and directing conversations. His wife and daughter remain largely silent during his monologues, a reflection of the expectation that women should defer to male authority. For example, Mr. Birling dismisses Sheila’s early attempts to engage in conversation, addressing her with condescending remarks, such as “Nothing to do with you, Sheila. Run along.” Priestley’s use of dialogue here reveals Mr. Birling’s patronizing attitude toward his daughter, reinforcing the notion that women are excluded from serious matters. This reflects the broader societal belief that men were the decision-makers and providers, while women were relegated to domestic roles. Priestley critiques this patriarchal structure, exposing how it limits women’s voices and autonomy, even within their own families.\nThe theme of gender roles is also explored through the expectations placed on women, particularly Sheila and Mrs. Birling, in their social and familial roles. Sheila, as the young fiancée, is expected to conform to traditional ideas of femininity—passive, obedient, and concerned with appearances. She is initially portrayed as being focused on material things, as seen when she gushes over her engagement ring, saying, “Now I really feel engaged!” Priestley uses characterisation here to show how Sheila has been conditioned to value superficial markers of success and happiness, reflecting the limited scope of ambition allowed to women in Edwardian society. Similarly, Mrs. Birling’s role is defined by her position as the matriarch, whose primary concerns are maintaining the family’s reputation and upholding social propriety. She advises Sheila to “get used to” Gerald’s absences, implying that it is a wife’s duty to tolerate her husband’s behavior without question. Through Mrs. Birling’s advice, Priestley reveals the social expectation that women should prioritize their husbands’ comfort and maintain appearances, regardless of personal dissatisfaction. These expectations highlight the limited opportunities for women to assert independence or challenge their prescribed roles.\nWhile Priestley initially presents Sheila as conforming to traditional gender roles, there are early signs that she will challenge these expectations as the play progresses. Even before the Inspector’s arrival, Sheila’s suspicion of Gerald’s behavior suggests that she is beginning to question the dynamics of their relationship. Her playful teasing about Gerald’s absence over the summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—hints at her discomfort with his secrecy, indicating that she is not entirely passive or unquestioning. Priestley’s use of foreshadowing here is important, as it signals Sheila’s potential for growth and rebellion against the gender norms that confine her. As the play continues, Sheila’s transformation becomes more apparent, but even in the early scenes, her perceptiveness and willingness to speak out against injustice set her apart from the traditional, passive female role. Priestley uses Sheila’s character to suggest that younger women, in particular, may be more open to challenging the status quo and advocating for change, aligning with the broader theme of generational conflict and social reform.\nIn the early part of An Inspector Calls, Priestley explores the theme of gender roles through the patriarchal control exerted by men like Mr. Birling, the restrictive social expectations placed on women like Sheila and Mrs. Birling, and the subtle challenges to these traditional roles. While women are expected to remain submissive and focused on domestic concerns, Priestley introduces early hints that Sheila, in particular, may break free from these constraints. Through his critique of the unequal treatment of women, Priestley exposes the limitations of Edwardian gender norms and suggests the potential for change, a message that resonated with audiences in 1945 and continues to hold relevance in modern discussions of gender equality. Sheila’s emerging independence foreshadows the broader social changes that Priestley advocates for, as the play’s moral lessons about responsibility and justice are closely tied to the rejection of outdated gender roles."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The main character is a central character who acts as the audience surrogate—we experience the story through their eyes.

Priestley uses the common name ‘John Smith’ to symbolize the universality of the suffering of the working classes, largely forgotten and neglected by the wealthy.\nexploitation\n“renton”\nArguably, the name “Renton” is dervived from the verb “to rent”, a euphemism for prostitution in the early 20th Century. Priestley uses this change in name to mark Eva being forced to change her approach to surviving in a hostile society. She can no longer survive by working hard and therefore she must go against her own moral principles to survive, engaging in prostitution\n“young and fresh and charming and altogether out of place down there”.\nThe adjective “fresh” bears connotations of desire and fertility, demonstrating that Gerald views her with sexual intent from the start, describing her like food, an example of misogynistic objectification.

Furthermore, he recalls her telling him she had a job that she had to “leave after a strike” and “said something about the shop too”.

Priestley introduces Inspector Goole as a pivotal character who disrupts the complacent world of the Birling family. The play, set in 1912, reflects the rigid class divisions and capitalist ideologies of the time, but it was written in 1945, when the world was recovering from the devastations of two world wars. Through the Inspector, Priestley presents a moral critique of the upper classes and their refusal to accept responsibility for the welfare of others. The Inspector’s arrival marks a turning point in the play, as he challenges the Birlings’ views and forces them to confront their actions. This essay will explore the initial impressions of the Inspector, focusing on his authoritative presence, his moral purpose, and his role as a social conscience. These impressions relate to the play’s broader themes of social responsibility and justice, offering a critique of capitalist society that resonates with both contemporary and modern audiences.\nFrom the moment the Inspector arrives, Priestley establishes him as an authoritative and commanding figure. His entrance is described as “creating an impression of massiveness, solidity, and purposefulness.” The use of stage directions here is key in conveying his physical presence and the sense that he is not easily intimidated or swayed by the Birlings’ social status. This contrasts sharply with the initially relaxed and celebratory atmosphere of the Birling family dinner, immediately suggesting that the Inspector represents a serious force. His calm, methodical questioning style furthers this impression of control, as he refuses to be rushed or distracted by Mr. Birling’s attempts to assert his authority. The effect of this authoritative presence is to unsettle the characters and the audience alike, suggesting that the Inspector has come not just to investigate a crime, but to reveal uncomfortable truths about the Birlings’ moral failures. His authoritative nature positions him as a figure of moral judgment, aligning him with the play’s broader critique of those in power who seek to avoid responsibility.\nThe Inspector’s dialogue is immediately marked by a clear sense of moral purpose. Unlike Mr. Birling, who speaks in terms of business, profits, and individual success, the Inspector’s language emphasizes collective responsibility and the consequences of neglecting others. One of the first things he says is that “what happened to her may have determined what happened to her afterwards.” This use of repetition highlights the Inspector’s belief in the interconnectedness of actions and consequences, introducing the theme of cause and effect that underpins the entire play. The Inspector’s moral stance is further emphasized when he reminds the Birlings, “We are members of one body,” stressing the idea of shared responsibility. This concept directly opposes Mr. Birling’s earlier speech about individualism. By presenting the Inspector as a moral figure, Priestley uses him as a vehicle to deliver the play’s central message about the need for social responsibility. This is particularly significant in the historical context of the play, written in the aftermath of World War II, when many were questioning the values of individualism and the role of collective action in rebuilding society.\nOne of the most significant initial impressions of the Inspector is that he functions as a social conscience for the characters. His interrogative style, asking pointed and direct questions, forces each member of the Birling family to confront their own involvement in the chain of events leading to Eva Smith’s death. The Inspector’s role is not merely to uncover facts but to encourage self-reflection and moral accountability. His refusal to accept evasions or excuses from the Birlings, such as when Mr. Birling tries to justify firing Eva, is a deliberate attempt to strip away their rationalizations and make them face the impact of their actions. The effect of this technique is to place the audience in a position where they too must consider their own responsibility to others. Priestley uses the Inspector’s character to challenge both the Birlings and the audience to reflect on their role in society, making him a powerful representation of the play’s social critique. In a modern context, this theme remains relevant as issues of inequality, corporate responsibility, and social justice continue to be debated.\nIn An Inspector Calls, the initial impressions of the Inspector are of a powerful, morally driven figure who serves as both a literal and symbolic force in the play. His authoritative presence unsettles the complacency of the Birlings, his language emphasizes the importance of collective responsibility, and his questioning style acts as a social conscience, challenging the characters and the audience to reflect on their actions. Priestley uses the Inspector to communicate his central message: that a just and compassionate society requires individuals to accept responsibility for each other. This message remains as relevant today as it was in 1945, as the world continues to grapple with issues of inequality, social justice, and the moral responsibilities of the powerful. Through the character of the Inspector, Priestley calls for a society built on empathy and collective responsibility, offering a timeless critique of capitalist individualism."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-do-we-learn-about-the-relationship-between-Sheila-and-Gerald-early-in-the-play":{"title":"What do we learn about the relationship between Sheila and Gerald early in the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In the early part of An Inspector Calls, we learn several key details about the relationship between Sheila and Gerald, which reveal both their affection for each other and underlying tensions. Priestley uses their interactions to explore themes of trust, class expectations, and gender dynamics within upper-class Edwardian society.\nAt the beginning of the play, Sheila and Gerald are celebrating their engagement, and there is a sense of excitement and joy. Sheila expresses her happiness, exclaiming, “I think it’s perfect. Now I really feel engaged.” This shows that Sheila is initially delighted about the future she envisions with Gerald. Priestley presents the couple’s relationship as one that appears loving and happy on the surface, with Sheila thrilled about the engagement and Gerald seemingly proud of the match. However, this celebration also emphasizes societal expectations, as their engagement brings together two wealthy, influential families, suggesting the marriage may also serve a social purpose beyond personal affection.\nDespite the outward appearance of happiness, there are early hints of tension and suspicion between Sheila and Gerald. Sheila teases Gerald about his absence during the previous summer, saying, “Except for all last summer, when you never came near me.” Though Sheila’s comment is framed as playful, it reveals her underlying doubts about Gerald’s fidelity. Priestley introduces this tension to foreshadow later revelations about Gerald’s affair with Daisy Renton (Eva Smith). The cracks in their relationship, even in this early stage, suggest that their engagement is not built on complete trust, highlighting the theme of secrecy and deceit that runs throughout the play.\nThe early interactions between Sheila and Gerald also reflect the gender expectations of the time. Gerald, as a man, holds more power in the relationship, with Sheila initially appearing to adopt a submissive role. For example, Sheila eagerly accepts Gerald’s engagement ring and responds with excitement and gratitude, conforming to the traditional role of a woman in Edwardian society. However, Sheila’s growing suspicion about Gerald’s behavior suggests that she is not entirely content with this dynamic. Priestley uses this tension to critique the unequal gender roles of the period, as Sheila’s eventual confrontation with Gerald later in the play will reveal her desire for honesty and equality in their relationship.\nIn the early part of An Inspector Calls, we learn that Sheila and Gerald’s relationship is outwardly affectionate, but there are underlying tensions and a lack of complete trust. Priestley uses their relationship to explore themes of social expectations, secrecy, and the gender dynamics of the time. While their engagement seems to symbolize a happy union, the early hints of suspicion set the stage for the deeper conflicts and revelations that will unfold as the play progresses."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-initial-clues-does-Priestley-provide-about-the-Inspector’s-role-in-the-opening-of-the-play":{"title":"What initial clues does Priestley provide about the Inspector’s role in the opening of the play?","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley introduces Inspector Goole as a central figure whose purpose extends beyond a traditional police investigation. From his first appearance, Priestley subtly signals that the Inspector is more than a mere detective—he represents a moral force, intent on exposing the moral failings of the Birling family and holding them accountable for their actions. Set in 1912, the play critiques the class inequalities and moral complacency of the Edwardian era, and the Inspector serves as the vehicle for this critique. Priestley uses clues such as the Inspector’s timing, his authoritative presence, and the tone of his questioning to indicate that his role is not just to gather facts, but to act as a moral judge, forcing the characters to confront their own guilt. This essay will explore the initial clues that Priestley provides about the Inspector’s true role, focusing on his entrance, his methodical questioning, and his symbolic presence.\nOne of the first clues about the Inspector’s role comes with the timing of his entrance. Priestley carefully orchestrates his arrival to coincide with a moment when Mr. Birling is delivering a speech about individual responsibility and capitalist values. Mr. Birling dismisses the idea of social responsibility, proclaiming, “A man has to make his own way—has to look after himself—and his family too, of course.” Just as he finishes this assertion, the doorbell rings, signaling the Inspector’s arrival. This timing is not coincidental; it is a deliberate interruption of Birling’s capitalist rhetoric. Priestley uses dramatic timing to suggest that the Inspector’s purpose is to challenge Birling’s worldview and introduce a more socially responsible perspective. The Inspector’s entrance is thus a symbolic one, marking the moment when the family’s comfortable illusions will begin to unravel. His arrival at this specific moment signals that his role is to question not only the characters’ actions but also their moral beliefs.\nAnother early clue about the Inspector’s role lies in the way Priestley describes his physical presence. The stage directions describe him as creating “an impression of massiveness, solidity and purposefulness.” Despite not being physically imposing, the Inspector exudes authority and control, unsettling the characters from the moment he arrives. Priestley’s use of stage directions emphasizes the Inspector’s otherworldly or symbolic nature, suggesting that he is more than just a detective following procedure. His calm but firm demeanor contrasts with the Birlings’ initial sense of security, as he quickly establishes dominance in the room. This shift in power dynamics hints that the Inspector is there to hold the family accountable for more than just their involvement in a single event. His purpose seems to be to probe deeper into their consciences and force them to confront their moral failings. This authoritative presence sets the tone for the rest of the play, where the Inspector’s role as a moral judge becomes increasingly clear.\nThe Inspector’s methodical and purposeful questioning also provides early clues about his role. Unlike a typical investigator, who might focus solely on the facts of the case, the Inspector’s questions seem designed to reveal the moral culpability of each character. For example, when he asks Mr. Birling about his decision to fire Eva Smith, he does not focus on the legality of the action but rather on its ethical implications. The Inspector states, “What happened to her then may have determined what happened to her afterwards,” emphasizing the chain of consequences that led to Eva’s death. Priestley uses dialogue here to highlight the Inspector’s focus on cause and effect, suggesting that he is more interested in exposing the characters’ collective responsibility than in assigning individual blame for specific actions. The tone of his questioning, which is calm but insistent, creates an atmosphere of moral scrutiny, where the characters are forced to reflect on the broader impact of their actions. This early emphasis on moral responsibility, rather than legal guilt, signals that the Inspector’s role is to deliver a moral judgment on the Birlings and Gerald, rather than merely solve a crime.\nIn the opening scenes of An Inspector Calls, Priestley provides several key clues about the Inspector’s true role, signaling that he is more than a conventional detective. His timely entrance, authoritative presence, and morally focused questioning all suggest that he serves as a symbolic force, intent on exposing the moral failings of the Birling family and forcing them to confront their collective responsibility. The Inspector’s role as a moral judge becomes increasingly clear as the play progresses, but Priestley’s careful construction of the character’s entrance and early interactions sets the stage for this revelation. Through the Inspector, Priestley critiques the capitalist and individualistic values of the upper class, emphasizing the importance of social responsibility—a message that resonates as strongly today as it did when the play was written."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-role-does-Sheila-play-in-the-early-tension-between-the-characters-before-the-Inspector’s-arrival":{"title":"What role does Sheila play in the early tension between the characters before the Inspector’s arrival?","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, Sheila Birling plays a significant role in creating and highlighting the early tension between characters, even before the arrival of Inspector Goole. Set in 1912, the play explores the dynamics of a wealthy Edwardian family, revealing underlying cracks in their relationships that mirror broader societal tensions. Sheila, as the younger and more emotionally perceptive member of the Birling family, acts as a catalyst for some of the early unease, questioning the assumptions and behaviors of her parents and fiancé, Gerald. Priestley uses Sheila’s interactions with the other characters to reveal hidden conflicts and foreshadow the moral awakening that will unfold throughout the play. This essay will explore how Sheila contributes to the early tension, focusing on her interactions with Gerald, her strained relationship with her parents, and her role in exposing the superficiality of their celebration.\nOne of the earliest sources of tension is between Sheila and her fiancé, Gerald Croft. While the family celebrates their engagement, Sheila’s playful remarks about Gerald’s absence the previous summer reveal underlying doubts about his honesty. She lightly teases him, saying, “Except for all last summer, when you never came near me,” which Priestley uses as a hint of mistrust. Although delivered in a seemingly light-hearted manner, this remark introduces an element of suspicion and foreshadows Gerald’s later confession about his affair with Eva Smith. Priestley uses dramatic irony here, as the audience senses that there is more to Gerald’s story than he is willing to admit, even though Sheila initially appears to brush off her concerns. Sheila’s unease with Gerald creates an undercurrent of tension that disrupts the otherwise celebratory mood, suggesting that their relationship is built on superficial harmony rather than genuine trust. Priestley uses this tension to expose the fragility of upper-class relationships, which are often based more on appearances than emotional honesty.\nSheila’s interactions with her parents, particularly Mr. Birling, also contribute to the early tension in the play. While Mr. Birling dominates the conversation with long speeches about business, capitalism, and self-reliance, Sheila’s discomfort with his views becomes apparent. She does not openly challenge her father at this stage, but her discomfort is subtly conveyed through body language and tone. For instance, when Mr. Birling makes dismissive comments about social change and workers’ rights, Sheila’s reaction suggests that she is less comfortable with these views than her parents. This contrast creates a quiet tension between the generations, with Sheila representing a more compassionate and open-minded perspective, though she has yet to fully articulate it. Priestley uses this generational tension to introduce one of the play’s central themes: the possibility of social change. Sheila’s emerging moral awareness stands in contrast to her parents’ complacency, creating a sense of underlying conflict that will later come to the forefront as the Inspector’s revelations unfold.\nFinally, Sheila plays a key role in exposing the superficial nature of the Birling family’s celebration. While the evening is meant to be a joyous occasion marking her engagement to Gerald, Sheila’s perceptiveness disrupts the illusion of harmony. Her suspicions about Gerald’s behavior, as well as her subtle discomfort with her father’s pompous speeches, reveal that the family’s outward appearance of success and happiness is built on shaky foundations. Priestley uses dialogue to highlight Sheila’s role as a character who sees beyond the surface. For instance, her teasing of Gerald may seem trivial, but it hints at deeper insecurities and foreshadows the moral reckoning to come. Sheila’s ability to sense the underlying issues in her relationships with Gerald and her parents suggests that she is more attuned to the emotional reality of the situation than the others, who are focused on maintaining appearances. This early tension, driven by Sheila’s perceptiveness, sets the stage for the unraveling of the family’s superficial values once the Inspector arrives.\nIn the early scenes of An Inspector Calls, Sheila plays a crucial role in introducing tension between the characters, even before the Inspector’s arrival. Her strained relationship with Gerald, marked by suspicion and mistrust, foreshadows the later revelations of infidelity, while her discomfort with her parents’ capitalist values hints at the generational divide that will become more pronounced as the play progresses. Sheila’s role in exposing the superficiality of the family’s celebration reflects her emerging moral awareness, positioning her as a key figure in Priestley’s critique of the upper class’s focus on appearances and self-interest. Through Sheila, Priestley introduces the cracks in the Birling family’s relationships, which will be further exposed and deepened by the Inspector’s investigation into their collective responsibility for the tragedy of Eva Smith."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-Mrs-Birlings-attitude-towards-Eva-Smith-early-parts":{"title":"how does Priestley present Mrs Birlings attitude towards Eva Smith early parts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"An Inspector Calls, written by J.B. Priestley in 1945, is set in 1912, a period marked by rigid class divisions, entrenched capitalist ideologies, and little regard for social responsibility. The play critiques the moral failings of the upper classes, focusing on their lack of empathy toward the working class. Priestley’s socialist beliefs, shaped by the social changes that occurred after World War II, are evident in his condemnation of characters like Mrs. Birling, who represents the entrenched privilege and moral blindness of the upper class. Through the character of Mrs. Birling, Priestley illustrates the disdainful and dismissive attitudes the upper class had towards the lower class, as exemplified by her treatment of Eva Smith. This essay will explore how Priestley presents Mrs. Birling’s attitude toward Eva Smith in the early parts of the play, focusing on her lack of empathy, her sense of superiority, and her refusal to take responsibility. These attitudes are used to critique the wider social inequalities of the time and to highlight the need for social change.\nIn the early scenes of the play, Mrs. Birling is portrayed as a woman who lacks empathy for those of a lower social class, particularly Eva Smith. Her attitude is immediately apparent when the Inspector begins his inquiry, as she quickly dismisses the plight of Eva Smith, who represents the struggling working class. Mrs. Birling refers to Eva as “a girl of that class” in a tone that suggests disdain and distance. Priestley uses derogatory language here to reveal Mrs. Birling’s deep-seated prejudice and lack of concern for the struggles faced by the working class. The phrase “that class” dehumanizes Eva and reduces her identity to her social status, emphasizing the emotional and moral detachment of Mrs. Birling. This lack of empathy is central to Priestley’s critique of the upper classes, who, like Mrs. Birling, are disconnected from the suffering caused by their actions. This also connects to the play’s broader theme of social responsibility, as Mrs. Birling’s indifference to Eva’s plight reflects her unwillingness to acknowledge any sense of obligation to those less fortunate.\nMrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is also shaped by her overwhelming sense of superiority, both in terms of class and morality. As a member of the upper class, she views herself as inherently better than those below her, which is evident in her refusal to treat Eva Smith with any compassion or understanding. When discussing the charity committee she heads, Mrs. Birling reveals her belief that only those she deems “deserving” should be helped. She is particularly offended by Eva’s use of the name “Mrs. Birling” when seeking assistance, describing it as “a piece of gross impertinence.” Priestley’s use of dramatic irony here is important, as the audience can see the absurdity of Mrs. Birling’s indignation; the very thing that outrages her is a trivial detail, yet she allows it to justify her refusal to help a desperate young woman. This sense of superiority not only reflects the class divisions of Edwardian society but also illustrates how the upper classes maintained their power by dehumanizing and belittling the lower classes. Priestley uses characterisation to depict Mrs. Birling as a representative of the ruling elite, who views those beneath her as undeserving of respect or support. This attitude ties into the play’s larger theme of social inequality—Mrs. Birling’s refusal to help Eva shows her belief that individuals of higher status are not only socially but morally superior. This sense of entitlement prevents Mrs. Birling from seeing Eva as an individual deserving of basic dignity, which highlights the disconnect between the wealthy and the working class in early 20th-century Britain. Priestley critiques this attitude, using Mrs. Birling’s arrogance to emphasize the destructive nature of class-based prejudice and the need for social reform.\nAnother key aspect of Mrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is her absolute refusal to accept any responsibility for her actions. When the Inspector questions her about her role in denying help to Eva, Mrs. Birling is quick to defend herself, saying, “I did nothing I’m ashamed of.” Priestley uses repetition of Mrs. Birling’s defensive statements to highlight her deep sense of self-righteousness and her inability to reflect on the consequences of her actions. Her refusal to admit fault demonstrates her belief that her social status places her beyond moral scrutiny. This lack of accountability is crucial to Priestley’s critique of the upper class, who, in his view, exploit and harm the working class while refusing to acknowledge the impact of their actions. Mrs. Birling’s insistence that she is blameless, even after learning of Eva’s tragic fate, reinforces the play’s exploration of collective responsibility—the idea that society must work together to protect its most vulnerable members. Mrs. Birling’s failure to take responsibility is a clear illustration of the moral failings of the upper class, and Priestley uses her character to advocate for greater social responsibility and reform.\nIn the early parts of An Inspector Calls, Mrs. Birling’s attitude towards Eva Smith is characterized by a lack of empathy, a strong sense of superiority, and a refusal to accept responsibility. Priestley presents Mrs. Birling as a representative of the privileged upper class, whose attitudes towards the working class are shaped by indifference and arrogance. Through her character, Priestley critiques the social inequalities of Edwardian society and highlights the need for compassion and collective responsibility. Mrs. Birling’s disdain for Eva Smith serves as a reminder of the dangers of moral blindness, reinforcing the play’s central message that a fair and just society must be built on empathy and social accountability—a message that resonates as strongly in today’s world as it did in 1945."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-Sheila's-change-throughout-the-play":{"title":"how does Priestley present Sheila's change throughout the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents Sheila Birling’s transformation as central to the play’s message of personal responsibility and moral growth. At the start of the play, Sheila is portrayed as naïve and sheltered, but as the Inspector reveals uncomfortable truths, she becomes more aware of her own actions and the world around her. By the end, Sheila has evolved into a socially conscious and self-reflective individual, embodying Priestley’s call for change in society.\nFirst, Priestley shows Sheila’s initial naivety and superficiality. In the opening scene, Sheila is excited about her engagement to Gerald, focusing on material things like her engagement ring: “Isn’t it a beauty?” This shows Sheila’s preoccupation with wealth and status, a reflection of her upbringing in a privileged, upper-class family. Her use of light-hearted, almost childish language reveals her immaturity, as she remains oblivious to the problems and injustices around her. At this stage, Sheila’s character symbolizes the younger generation’s initial ignorance of their societal responsibilities. However, Priestley foreshadows her potential for growth through her initial curiosity about the Inspector’s visit, hinting that she is more open-minded than her parents.\nAs the Inspector’s investigation progresses, Sheila begins to confront uncomfortable truths about herself and her role in Eva Smith’s downfall. After realizing she was responsible for having Eva fired from Milward’s, Sheila is deeply ashamed, admitting, “I know I’m to blame – and I’m desperately sorry.” This marks a turning point in Sheila’s character, as she moves from ignorance to self-awareness. Unlike her parents, who deflect blame and refuse to change, Sheila acknowledges her guilt and begins to accept responsibility. Priestley uses Sheila’s growing remorse to contrast with the older generation’s stubbornness, illustrating the hope he places in the younger generation to learn from their mistakes and embrace social responsibility.\nBy the end of the play, Sheila’s transformation is complete, and she becomes a voice of moral integrity. Even after it’s revealed that the Inspector may not be a real police officer, Sheila refuses to dismiss the lessons learned: “It doesn’t make any real difference.” This shows her newfound maturity; she understands that the moral truth of their actions remains, regardless of the Inspector’s identity. Sheila now embodies Priestley’s message of collective responsibility, urging her family to change and warning them about the dangers of returning to their old ways. Her sharp contrast with her parents, who quickly return to their selfish attitudes, highlights the divide between those willing to change and those who remain entrenched in their privilege.\nIn conclusion, Priestley shows Sheila’s change throughout the play to highlight the potential for personal growth and social change. From a naïve, sheltered girl focused on material concerns, Sheila evolves into a self-aware, morally responsible woman. Through her transformation, Priestley advocates for a new generation that will reject the complacency of the past and take responsibility for creating a fairer society."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-the-character-of-Mr.-Birling-in-the-early-parts-of-the-play":{"title":"how does Priestley present the character of Mr. Birling in the early parts of the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"An Inspector Calls, written by J.B. Priestley in 1945, is set in 1912, just before the First World War. The play is rooted in the context of Edwardian society, a period marked by stark class divisions, social inequality, and the dominance of capitalist ideology. Priestley, a socialist, uses the character of Mr. Birling, a prosperous businessman, to critique the capitalist class and its attitudes toward society. Through Birling, Priestley explores themes of responsibility, social hierarchy, and the consequences of ignorance. In Act 1, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of arrogance, individualism, and a refusal to accept social responsibility, reflecting the broader critique of the ruling elite and their disregard for the welfare of the working class.\nIn Act 1, Mr. Birling is introduced as a man full of confidence, particularly in his speeches about the future. For example, he confidently asserts, “The Germans don’t want war. Nobody wants war,” and later claims the Titanic is “unsinkable, absolutely unsinkable.” Priestley uses dramatic irony here, as the audience, aware of the historical events that follow, knows both statements are disastrously wrong. Birling’s overconfidence reveals his ignorance and lack of insight into global affairs, which makes him appear foolish in the eyes of the audience. This dramatic irony is a key technique Priestley uses to criticize the arrogance of the upper classes, who, like Birling, often make grand statements without truly understanding the complexity of the world. This not only underscores Birling’s blindness to the world around him but also ties into the play’s broader theme of social responsibility. Birling’s dismissal of future conflict and disaster represents his unwillingness to acknowledge the need for collective responsibility, a point that Priestley critiques by showing the consequences of such attitudes in history.\nMr. Birling is portrayed as the embodiment of capitalist ideology, with a strong emphasis on individual success over collective welfare. His speech about individualism—“a man has to mind his own business and look after himself and his own”—demonstrates his belief that success is earned through personal effort, with no obligation to the wider community. Priestley employs characterization to reveal Birling’s capitalist outlook, positioning him as a foil to the Inspector, who later advocates for social responsibility. This focus on individualism reflects the socio-political context of 1912, where the ruling elite prioritized profit and personal gain over workers’ rights. The Edwardian class system reinforced this, allowing figures like Birling to prosper while the working class, represented by characters like Eva Smith, were exploited. Priestley’s critique of capitalism is evident here: he presents Birling’s worldview as outdated and harmful, directly opposing the play’s call for social change and collective accountability. In modern times, this critique resonates with contemporary debates on economic inequality and corporate responsibility, making Birling’s views appear even more problematic to today’s audiences.\nThroughout Act 1, Mr. Birling displays a blatant disregard for the notion of social responsibility, a key theme in An Inspector Calls. When the Inspector questions him about his role in Eva Smith’s dismissal, Birling shows no remorse, justifying his actions by saying, “If you don’t come down sharply on these people, they’d soon be asking for the earth.” This dismissive attitude towards the working class reflects Birling’s belief in the social hierarchy, where the upper class has the right to control and exploit the labor of the lower classes without question. Priestley’s use of rhetoric here highlights Birling’s complete lack of empathy. By depicting Birling as a man who cannot recognize the impact of his actions on others, Priestley critiques the moral failings of the capitalist elite. Birling’s refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for Eva’s fate contrasts sharply with the Inspector’s call for collective responsibility: “We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other.” Priestley uses this tension to advance the play’s central moral lesson—society’s future depends on individuals accepting responsibility for the well-being of others. The consequences of Birling’s refusal to change highlight the play’s message that ignoring social responsibility leads to disaster, both on a personal and societal level.\nIn Act 1 of An Inspector Calls, Priestley presents Mr. Birling as a symbol of capitalist arrogance, ignorance, and selfishness. Through his misplaced confidence in his predictions about the future, his promotion of individualism over collective welfare, and his refusal to accept any responsibility for the working class, Birling embodies the moral and social failures of the ruling elite. Priestley’s critique of capitalism, social inequality, and the importance of responsibility resonates through Birling’s character, making him a figure of ridicule and, ultimately, a cautionary tale. The character of Mr. Birling stands as a reminder that society’s progress depends on the recognition of collective responsibility, a message that remains as relevant today as it was in 1945."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-is-Gerald-presented-in-early-parts":{"title":"how is Gerald presented in early parts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley uses the character of Gerald Croft to represent the upper-class attitudes of complacency, privilege, and superficial morality. Gerald, engaged to Sheila Birling, is a key figure in the early part of the play, embodying the social expectations and values of the aristocratic class to which he belongs. Written in 1945 and set in 1912, the play critiques the entrenched class structures and capitalist ideology of pre-World War I Britain, where people like Gerald maintained their wealth and power at the expense of the working class. Priestley presents Gerald in the early part of the play as a charming and polished young man, yet hints of his superficial morality and entitlement suggest he, like the Birlings, will be forced to confront his role in the mistreatment of the lower classes. This essay will explore how Priestley presents Gerald in the early part of the play, focusing on his charm, his attempts to maintain social harmony, and the early hints of his duplicity.\nFrom the beginning, Gerald is presented as a charming, confident figure, well-suited to the Birling family’s upper-class circle. His engagement to Sheila is described as beneficial for both families, reinforcing the idea that Gerald’s character represents the social expectations of his class. Priestley uses dialogue to emphasize Gerald’s charm, particularly in his interactions with Mr. Birling, who views Gerald as a respectable young man and ideal son-in-law. When Mr. Birling speaks to Gerald about the marriage, he states, “Your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me,” underscoring how Gerald’s character is tied to business alliances and family reputation. Gerald’s smooth, polite demeanor reflects the way upper-class men like him are trained to project confidence and social grace. However, this charm is superficial, as Priestley later reveals that Gerald’s polished exterior hides deeper moral failings. The early presentation of Gerald as charming but shallow sets up the tension between appearances and reality, a theme Priestley explores throughout the play.\nGerald’s initial role in the play is to maintain social harmony and ease any tension, particularly between Sheila and her father. For example, when Sheila teases Gerald about his absence the previous summer, he quickly reassures her with a plausible excuse about being “busy at the works.” Priestley uses dramatic irony here, as the audience later discovers that Gerald was, in fact, having an affair with Eva Smith during this time. Gerald’s ability to deflect potential conflict with smooth explanations highlights his desire to keep up appearances and avoid uncomfortable truths. His involvement in the engagement party and interactions with the Birlings further establish him as someone who prioritizes social stability, reflecting the upper-class belief in maintaining the status quo. Gerald’s reluctance to engage with the deeper emotional and moral issues at play, even when Sheila hints at her suspicions, foreshadows the revelations that will later unravel his carefully constructed persona. Priestley uses Gerald’s character to critique the superficial values of the upper class, who often prioritize social harmony over confronting uncomfortable truths.\nThough Gerald initially appears charming and dependable, Priestley introduces early hints of his duplicity that will later come to light during the Inspector’s inquiry. Sheila’s teasing remark about his absence over the summer—“Except for all last summer, when you never came near me”—reveals underlying tensions in their relationship, suggesting that Gerald has secrets he is hiding. Priestley’s use of foreshadowing here is subtle but significant, planting seeds of doubt about Gerald’s true character. While Gerald insists that he was busy with work, the audience senses that there is more to his story. Priestley uses Gerald’s initial dishonesty to highlight the theme of secrecy and deception that runs throughout the play, with the upper class often hiding their moral failings behind a facade of respectability. Gerald’s early duplicity, though not fully revealed at this point, signals to the audience that his charm and confidence may be masking deeper flaws. This tension between appearance and reality is central to Priestley’s critique of the upper class, whose wealth and privilege often allow them to evade accountability for their actions.\nIn the early part of An Inspector Calls, Gerald is presented as a charming and confident young man who fits seamlessly into the Birling family’s upper-class world. However, Priestley hints at Gerald’s underlying moral weaknesses, using his charm and attempts to maintain social harmony to mask his duplicity. The early scenes set the stage for the revelations that will follow, as Gerald’s polished exterior is gradually stripped away to reveal his involvement in the mistreatment of Eva Smith. Through Gerald, Priestley critiques the superficial morality of the upper class, exposing the hypocrisy and entitlement that allows them to exploit others while maintaining an appearance of respectability. Gerald’s character embodies the tension between appearance and reality, a theme that remains central to the play’s broader critique of social inequality and the need for collective responsibility."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/last-moments-of-act-2-importance":{"title":"last moments of act 2 importance","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"in the final moments of act 2, Mrs. Birling finally reveals and admits that Eva Smith was pregnant and she refused to help her.

Priestley presents Mrs. Birling as a character who embodies the arrogance and moral complacency of the upper class in Edwardian society. As the wife of a wealthy industrialist and a prominent figure in charity work, Mrs. Birling is initially portrayed as self-assured, socially superior, and dismissive of those beneath her, particularly members of the working class like Eva Smith. Through Mrs. Birling’s language, attitudes, and interactions with her family, Priestley critiques the lack of social responsibility among the upper classes and their tendency to view the lower classes with contempt. In the early parts of the play, Mrs. Birling’s character is defined by her sense of superiority, her staunch defense of the class system, and her lack of empathy. This essay will explore these aspects of her character, as they reflect the central themes of class prejudice and moral responsibility in the play.\nIn the early scenes of the play, Mrs. Birling is presented as a woman who holds herself in high regard due to her social status. Priestley uses dialogue to convey her sense of superiority over others, particularly the working class. When discussing the events surrounding Eva Smith, she speaks with disdain, referring to her as “a girl of that class.” The use of the phrase “that class” demonstrates her belief that people from lower social strata are inherently inferior and not deserving of the same respect or consideration. This attitude is also evident in her interactions with her family; she speaks with authority and expects her opinions to be respected without question. For example, when she dismisses Sheila’s concerns or lightly scolds her for showing sensitivity, Priestley portrays Mrs. Birling as someone who upholds traditional gender roles and social hierarchy. This sense of superiority not only alienates her from the lower classes but also sets the stage for the Inspector’s critique of her moral failings later in the play.\nMrs. Birling’s prejudice against the working class is one of the key elements of her character. Priestley uses her as a symbol of the entrenched class divisions in Edwardian society, where the wealthy often viewed the poor as lazy or morally inferior. Her role as a prominent member of a charitable organization is filled with irony—though she is involved in charity work, she lacks genuine compassion for those she is supposed to help. This is evident when she says that Eva Smith, who sought help from her committee, was “impertinent” simply because she used the name Birling. This use of irony highlights the hypocrisy of Mrs. Birling’s charity work, which is more about maintaining her social status than genuinely helping those in need. Priestley uses her character to critique the moral blindness of the upper class, who, like Mrs. Birling, often refuse to acknowledge their complicity in perpetuating inequality.\nMrs. Birling’s lack of empathy is another defining feature of her character in the early parts of the play. She is shown to be emotionally detached and indifferent to the struggles of others, particularly those who are less fortunate. When discussing Eva Smith, she shows no remorse or understanding of the young woman’s plight, instead blaming her for her own misfortune. This lack of empathy extends to her family as well, as she often dismisses Sheila’s emotional responses and is oblivious to Eric’s struggles with alcohol. Priestley uses Mrs. Birling’s coldness to highlight the moral failings of the upper class, who prioritize their own comfort and reputation over the well-being of others. This attitude foreshadows her later refusal to take responsibility for her role in Eva Smith’s demise, further reinforcing the theme of social responsibility that runs throughout the play.\nIn the early parts of An Inspector Calls, Mrs. Birling is presented as a character defined by arrogance, class prejudice, and a lack of empathy. Through her sense of superiority, her dismissive attitude towards the working class, and her emotional detachment, Priestley critiques the moral complacency of the upper class and their failure to take responsibility for the welfare of others. Mrs. Birling’s character serves as a symbol of the entrenched social divisions of Edwardian society, and her attitudes are used by Priestley to highlight the need for greater social responsibility and empathy. As the play progresses, Mrs. Birling’s refusal to accept accountability for her actions becomes a central focus, reinforcing the play’s broader critique of the upper class and their resistance to change."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/potential-questions":{"title":"potential questions","links":["02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/starting-with-this-extract,-explore-how-Priestley-presents-Gerald's-attitude-to-women.","an-icloud-vault/02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/Untitled","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-the-character-of-Mr.-Birling-in-the-early-parts-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-do-we-learn-about-the-relationship-between-Sheila-and-Gerald-early-in-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-use-dramatic-irony-to-present-Mr.-Birling’s-views-at-the-start-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-is-the-theme-of-social-class-introduced-in-the-opening-scenes-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-are-the-initial-impressions-of-the-Inspector-when-he-first-arrives,-and-how-does-Priestley-create-tension","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-Mrs-Birlings-attitude-towards-Eva-Smith-early-parts","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-introduce-the-theme-of-responsibility-in-the-early","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/what-do-we-learn-about-eric's-character-in-early-parts-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-present-the-Birling-family-dynamics-in-the-opening-scenes","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-role-does-Sheila-play-in-the-early-tension-between-the-characters-before-the-Inspector’s-arrival","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/How-does-Priestley-present-the-theme-of-generational-conflict-between-Sheila-and-her-parents-in-the-early-scenes","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-does-Priestley-present-Sheila's-change-throughout-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/In-what-ways-does-Priestley-explore-the-theme-of-gender-roles-in-the-early-part-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/What-initial-clues-does-Priestley-provide-about-the-Inspector’s-role-in-the-opening-of-the-play","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/how-is-Gerald-presented-in-early-parts","02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/mrs-birling-presented"],"tags":[],"content":"starting with this extract, explore how Priestley presents Gerald’s attitude to women.\nUntitled\n\n\nhow does Priestley present the character of Mr. Birling in the early parts of the play\n\n\nWhat do we learn about the relationship between Sheila and Gerald early in the play?\n\n\nHow does Priestley use dramatic irony to present Mr. Birling’s views at the start of the play?\n\n\nHow is the theme of social class introduced in the opening scenes of the play?\n\n\nWhat are the initial impressions of the Inspector when he first arrives, and how does Priestley create tension?\n\n\nhow does Priestley present Mrs Birlings attitude towards Eva Smith early parts\n\n\nHow does Priestley introduce the theme of responsibility in the early\n\n\nwhat do we learn about eric’s character in early parts of the play\n\n\nHow does Priestley present the Birling family dynamics in the opening scenes of the play?\n\n\nWhat role does Sheila play in the early tension between the characters before the Inspector’s arrival?\n\n\nHow does Priestley present the theme of generational conflict between Sheila and her parents in the early scenes?\n\n\nhow does Priestley present Sheila’s change throughout the play\n\n\nIn what ways does Priestley explore the theme of gender roles in the early part of the play?\n\n\nWhat initial clues does Priestley provide about the Inspector’s role in the opening of the play?\n\n\nhow is Gerald presented in early parts\n\n\nmrs birling presented\n\n"},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/starting-with-this-extract,-explore-how-Priestley-presents-Gerald's-attitude-to-women.":{"title":"starting with this extract, explore how Priestley presents Gerald's attitude to women.","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Introduction\n\nRestate the question\n\ncontext\nauthor\nsetting\nwhen\nhistorical context\nsocial context\n\n\nthesis\n\ncentral idea or argument\nspecific, arguable, relate directly\n\n\n\nIn An Inspector calls, Priestly presents Gerald Croft’s attitudes towards women to reflect the broader social views in a patriarchal culture on women and moral fallings high class individuals. Written in 1945 but set in 1912, the play explores a time when women were largely viewed as inferior and possessions, and when higher classed people had more power over women, even worse if they were working class. Priestley uses Gerald to expose the exploitative behavior of upper class men towards vulnerable women, by showing how Gerald views women as objects, thinks relationships as a type of temporary business connection, and regards himself as a savior to the so called damsels in distress.\nBody\n\npoint\nevidence\ntechnique\neffect\nzoom\nlink/conclude\n\nWhen asked about how the relationship with Daisy ended, Gerald replies with “I had to go away for several weeks, […] so I broke it definitely before I went”, this shows how he objectifies women, and thinks they can be disposed of when they are of no value to him. This short fragment of the sentence of the breakup is said in a decisive yet casual tone with no afterthought or regret. When Gerald was  “very busy with the works”, he used Daisy to seek comfort because Daisy can take him in with unconditional love, yet after the busy period came to an end and thinking about long-term profit, he turns back to Sheila whose family can give him powerful support. This is in line with the time period when the play was set, where women are possessed and expendable, especially lower class women. Interestingly, Sheila, to some extent, is also regarded by Gerald as an ‘object’ that can offer some use that can otherwise not be gained from a working class girl. That is why Gerald turned away from her and then came back, not out of love, but mostly a utilitarian purpose. This is one way in which Priestley presents Gerald’s attitude of objectifying women.\nFurthermore, Gerald thinks of relationships as a type of business connection. This is shown to the audience when he says “I broke it definitely before I went”. The word “broke” implies finality and coldness, along with the diction of ‘broke off’, this applies to a situation where something short is easily ended, this gives off the impression of a quick cancellation of a business contract, revealing Gerald’s mindset of a relationship can be ‘broken off’ anytime considering it is just a temporary contract. His business-oriented mindset also can be seen when he uses Daisy when he is busy so that he can receive unconditional love without any concern; on the other hand, if it was Sheila, he would have needed to put effort back in while busily working to receive the love. After using Daisy, he abandons her so that he can subsequently reap the benefits of the Birling’s support. This, according to Gerald’s inherent business-oriented value, could be a win-win strategy for all parties, and that is why he does not feel a lot of guilt and feels justified. Priestley critiques this mindset by reflecting how both women and emotions are commodified, and love is only valuable if it brings tangible rewards.\nMoreover, Gerald’s reply to Sheila “All-right I did for a time” and when Gerald also tries to ‘shield’ Sheila from his ‘disgusting’ infidelity, patronizing her shows how he regards himself as a “fairy prince”, who saves the unfortunate women.  The metaphor of Gerald being a “fairy prince” shows us how Gerald justifies his exploitation by using the illusion of being the savior who first protects or saves them and therefore can dominate the relationship, or then decide to distance or get rid of them. Through this representation of Gerald’s view on women, the audience can understand how deep Gerald is in his own illusion, how societal norms are deeply rooted in his mind, and empathize with how unfair Sheila and Daisy were treated.\nFurthermore, Priestley’s use of dramatic irony serves to expose Gerald’s hypocrisy. At the end of the play, Gerald questions and doesn’t believe that the girl that the Inspector showed them were the same one and the Inspector was just talking nonsense. Priestley contrasts Gerald’s stagnation with the moral awakening of characters like Sheila, his dismissal of the Inspector interrogation reveals his unwillingness to acknowledge his faults. Priestley underscores how societal change requires not only introspection, but the willingness to act and change, and how deeply influenced people, like Gerald, cannot change because of their arrogance and unwillingness.\nConclusion\n\nconclude/restate points\nend with a good sentence\n\nIn conclusion, Priestley presents Gerald Croft’s attitudes towards women as expendable objects, his view of relationships as transactional, and self-perception of being a “fairy prince” to reveal the exploitative attitudes of upper-class men towards women and gender inequalities of the time. From a modern perspective, these views are not just relics of Edwardian society, but continue to resonate today. Priestly’s work clearly illustrates how old societal norms, that seem to be just, ramify and shoot out into every subconscious corner of people’s minds to a point of illusion, and society as a whole, even relevant now, has to receive Priestley’s big call for action and act on it together.\nEBI: explore the play’s structure - even after all that, the ending where we see that Gerald lacked moral growth, contrasts with Sheila, how this further critiques his attitude.\nshorter version maybe\nIn An Inspector Calls, Priestley uses Gerald Croft to expose the exploitative attitudes of upper-class men towards women in a patriarchal society. Though set in 1912, the play, written in 1945, critiques a time when women, especially those from the lower classes, were viewed as inferior and disposable. Through Gerald, Priestley reveals how these men objectified women, treated relationships as transactional, and saw themselves as “saviors” to vulnerable women.\nPriestley first exposes Gerald’s objectification of Daisy Renton. When Gerald says, “I had to go away for several weeks, so I broke it off definitely,” the clinical, decisive, and cold language reflects his detached attitude. The verb “broke” implies a quick, emotionless severance, treating Daisy as expendable once she’s no longer useful. Priestley critiques Gerald’s coldness, reflecting broader Edwardian views where lower-class women were disposable. Gerald’s lack of remorse highlights the moral corruption of his class, who use their privilege to dominate and discard women.\nGerald’s approach to relationships is also transactional. He seeks comfort in Daisy while he is “busy with work” but returns to Sheila for the financial and social benefits her family offers. This behavior mirrors capitalist values, where human connections are reduced to economic exchanges. Priestley critiques the upper class for commodifying both love and people, showing how Gerald’s decisions are driven by self-interest rather than emotional investment.\nGerald’s perception of himself as a “savior” reveals his patronizing attitude towards women. He claims to have helped Daisy because she was “young and pretty,” suggesting he views women through a lens of superficiality. The metaphor of the “fairy prince” reflects Gerald’s delusion, as he sees himself as Daisy’s rescuer when, in reality, he exploits her vulnerability. Priestley uses this to highlight the hypocrisy of upper-class men who justify their exploitation of women by casting themselves as protectors.\nDramatic irony further exposes Gerald’s flaws. Priestley contrasts Gerald’s stagnation with Sheila’s growth, showing how Gerald remains blind to his own moral failings. His refusal to accept responsibility, dismissing the Inspector’s interrogation as a “hoax,” highlights his lack of remorse and moral growth. While characters like Sheila evolve, Gerald stays rooted in his old ways, representing the resistance of the upper class to social change. Priestley’s structure—with Gerald’s stagnation set against Sheila’s development—reinforces the message that moral responsibility requires both introspection and action.\nIn conclusion, Priestley uses Gerald’s attitudes to reveal the exploitative nature of upper-class men, who treat women as objects and relationships as transactions. Gerald’s delusion of being a “fairy prince” exposes his hypocrisy, and his refusal to change underscores the dangers of complacency.  From a modern perspective, these views are not just relics of Edwardian society, but continue to resonate today. Priestly’s work clearly illustrates how old societal norms, that seem to be just, ramify and shoot out into every subconscious corner of people’s minds to a point of illusion, and society as a whole, even relevant now, has to receive Priestley’s big call for action and act on it together."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/what-do-we-learn-about-eric's-character-in-early-parts-of-the-play":{"title":"what do we learn about eric's character in early parts of the play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley uses Eric Birling’s character to reveal the moral complexities and inner turmoil of the younger generation in Edwardian society. Set in 1912 but written in 1945, the play critiques the era’s rigid class structure and the attitudes of the upper class towards social responsibility. Eric’s character serves as a reflection of the struggles faced by young men of his time, who are caught between societal expectations and personal conscience. Through Eric, Priestley explores themes of guilt, rebellion, and the need for moral growth.\nWhen we first meet Eric, he is portrayed as uncomfortable and awkward, particularly in social situations. His late arrival to the family celebration suggests he is not entirely at ease with his family dynamics. For instance, he stammers during conversations, which highlights his nervousness and detachment. Priestley’s characterization of Eric as somewhat isolated within his family reflects the tension between individual desires and societal expectations, setting the stage for his internal conflicts throughout the play.\nMoreover, Eric’s alcoholism is hinted at early in the play, suggesting deeper personal issues. He is described as “half-formed” and “nervous,” indicating that he may be using alcohol as a coping mechanism for his insecurities and discomfort. This detail not only foreshadows his later actions but also serves to critique the societal pressures placed on young men, who often feel compelled to conform to a specific masculine ideal. Priestley uses this aspect of Eric’s character to highlight the destructive nature of escapism within the upper class, where individuals mask their problems rather than confront them.\nEric’s rebelliousness against authority is another crucial aspect of his character. His interactions with his father reveal a growing discontent with Mr. Birling’s capitalist views. Eric’s challenge to his father’s perspectives suggests a burgeoning sense of social awareness and a desire for change. Priestley contrasts Eric’s moral uncertainty with Mr. Birling’s unwavering confidence in capitalism, emphasizing the generational divide and the potential for a more progressive outlook in the younger generation.\nAdditionally, Eric’s sensitivity and capacity for empathy are apparent, particularly in his relationship with Eva Smith (Daisy Renton). He expresses guilt over his role in her downfall, indicating a level of emotional depth that sets him apart from his family. Priestley’s portrayal of Eric as a character grappling with guilt reflects the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in a class-driven society, emphasizing the need for personal accountability.\nIn conclusion, the early portrayal of Eric Birling reveals a complex character marked by discomfort, rebellion, and sensitivity. Through Eric, Priestley critiques the societal pressures of Edwardian society while exploring themes of guilt and the potential for moral growth. Eric’s struggles with his identity and relationships highlight the necessity of self-reflection and social responsibility, making him a pivotal figure in the play’s overarching message. As the narrative unfolds, Eric’s character serves as a reminder that change is possible when individuals confront their moral failings and strive for a more equitable society."},"02_areas/ENGLISH/anInspectorCalls/what-does-the-opening-parts-of-the-play-reveal-about-the-birlings-dynamic":{"title":"what does the opening parts of the play reveal about the birlings dynamic","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In An Inspector Calls, J.B. Priestley presents the Birling family dynamics as a microcosm of early 20th-century British society, highlighting themes of class, responsibility, and generational conflict. Set in 1912 and written in 1945, the play critiques the complacency and moral failings of the upper class. Through the interactions between family members in the opening scenes, Priestley reveals the complexities of their relationships and sets the stage for the moral examination that unfolds throughout the play. The Birling family represents a rigid social structure that values status and wealth over empathy and accountability.\nThe play opens with a celebratory atmosphere as the Birling family gathers to toast Sheila’s engagement to Gerald Croft. This initial scene establishes a sense of unity and superficial harmony within the family. However, it quickly becomes apparent that beneath this facade lies tension and a lack of genuine connection. For instance, Mr. Birling’s dominant presence is evident as he insists on leading the conversation and expressing his capitalist views, reinforcing his authority. His dismissive attitude toward the younger generation’s concerns reveals the generational divide and foreshadows the conflicts that will arise later in the play.\nFurthermore, the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Birling is characterized by a lack of emotional depth. Mrs. Birling’s focus on social status and her disapproval of the working class exemplify her superficiality and adherence to societal norms. When she comments on Sheila’s engagement, her primary concern is how it will reflect on their family’s reputation, rather than on her daughter’s happiness. Priestley uses this dynamic to critique the materialistic values of the upper class, suggesting that their priorities are misaligned and ultimately harmful to their relationships.\nThe sibling relationship between Sheila and Eric also highlights the complexities within the Birling family. Sheila’s initial naivety and preoccupation with her engagement contrast with Eric’s discomfort and awkwardness, indicating a lack of understanding between them. Eric’s nervousness and isolation within the family are palpable, as he struggles to assert himself in the face of his father’s dominance. Priestley uses this contrast to emphasize the differing perspectives of the younger generation, who are beginning to question the values instilled in them by their parents.\nMoreover, the introduction of Gerald Croft into the family dynamic further complicates their interactions. While Gerald initially seems to fit into the Birling family mold, his relationship with Sheila reveals underlying tensions regarding class and gender roles. Priestley uses Gerald’s position as a representative of the upper class to expose the transactional nature of their relationships. His desire to please both Sheila and her family underscores the societal expectations placed on men to maintain power and status, which often leads to emotional detachment.\nIn conclusion, Priestley presents the Birling family dynamics in the opening scenes as a reflection of the broader societal issues of the time. Through their interactions, he reveals the superficiality, materialism, and emotional disconnection that characterize their relationships. The generational divide between the older and younger characters foreshadows the moral awakening that will challenge the family’s beliefs. Ultimately, the Birling family serves as a cautionary example of the consequences of prioritizing status over empathy, highlighting the need for social responsibility and change in both personal and societal contexts."},"02_areas/HISTORY/00_MOC":{"title":"00_MOC","links":["an-icloud-vault/02_areas/HISTORY/League-of-Nations/00_MOC"],"tags":[],"content":"LON"},"02_areas/HISTORY/01Peace-Treaties-of-19-23/TOV-reaction":{"title":"TOV reaction","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How each nation would react to the Treaty of Versailles\nFrance was the most satisfied\nwhile Germany really not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwar guiltreparationsterritories/coloniesarmed forcesleague of nationsGermanyANGRY, felt unfairly blamed for WW1furious about the massive reparationslost all colonies and significant territory, angry that German-speaking people are not togethermilitary restricted to 100,000 troops, no air force, tiny navy.

From the clauses in the TOV, Germany had to lose the Saar, a coalfield, for 15 years, Alsace Loraine, Upper Silesia and more. Each piece of territory had resources and pre-built infrastructure on it. Losing them decreased Germany’s resources and production capabilities, in vital areas such as iron, timber and coal. This meant that not only did they lose wealth, they were also set back because they lost the facilities to produce and grow, which massively affects their ability to heal from the damages of the war.\nGermany also suffered a huge amount of reparations in money, leading to hyperinflation. Germany had always been causing territorial trouble to France and was seen as the war starter, so they had to pay a huge amount of €6,600 million. This amount was not only not reasonable but also not achievable as Germany was also recovering from the war, how could they possibly get that amount of money to spare? Germany still kind of wanted to fulfill this clause but they couldn’t, and it led to hyperinflation. The inflation was so bad that a piece of bread could have bought a house. This hyperinflation made all citizens suffer because their savings are useless as prices have gone way up. If there weren’t a huge reparation, this economic consequence might not have caused millions to suffer.\nHowever, the TOV also brought political chaos as a consequence. In clause 231, Germany had to admit all guilt and blame for starting the war, and they were forced to sign it. This caused millions of Germans to rage because in their mind, it was the Kaiser who caused this and they shouldn’t have to suffer because of the Kaiser’s decisions. So, people began revolts and Putschs that led to political violence and even killed a German foreign minister. This made Germany divided and into chaos when it was already a time of despair.\nMoreover, one of the Putschs was led by Adolf Hitler, the TOV sowed the seed for revenge and anger into him and millions of others, ultimately leading to the Nazi party. Because of the overly harsh clauses and war guilt in the TOV&lt; people were angered, which made extremists who promised they would rebuild Germany and destroy the TOV popular. One of them was Hitler, who used the TOV’s harness to do speeches and campaigns, calling the drafters the ‘November Criminals’ and gained support and power in Germany, forming the Nazi party. This consequence made Germany be by a far right extremist and someone who wanted revenge and not for the country to re-develop and gain peace, which also contributed to World War 2.\nIn conclusion, there were big economic and political consequences of the TOV, in my opinion, I massively disagree that the economic consequences were more important for Germany than the political consequences because, in hindsight, the political consequences contributed to the start of World War 2 and the reparations were lifted a lot over the years it was introduced,\nGreat 10/10 \n“German Hatred of the TOV was justified” How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer. \nGerman hatred of the reparation clauses of the Treaty of Versaille was justified because it was way too harsh. Germany had to give up 16% of their coal fields along with half of its iron and steel Industry, this struck German pride and also limited their production. The most harsh term on the treaty was the £6,600 million they had to this was over loo billion gold racks! We cannot forget that Germany was also in the war and also suffered from losses, they had to recover too. But this gargantuan amount of a fine depletes and diverts the majority of their resources, hindering recovery massively. This was also supported and foreseen by British Economist Keynes in his book “The Economic consequences of the Peace” and, in 1923, we see total hyperinflation, where the money that could have bought a house could barely buy a loaf of bread. This huge reparation destabilized their economy and recovery and the hatred was totally justified. \nFurthermore, German citizens hated the fact that they had to take the guilt and were forced to sign the treaty. The world war was caused by many factors and yet it was all blamed on Germany. Even after the Kaiser was overthrown, they were to blame and citizens were not happy that the Kaiser’s war was theirs to take blame for. Because of “them starting the war”, Germany was also not invited to draft or discuss treaty terms and was forced to sign. This led to widespread discontent and lots of political conflicts, such as Putsches. The amount of conflict and public discontent he war guilt clause led to was also a justification of their hatred.\nHowever, one could say that the hatred against the whole ‘harsh’ treaty was not justified at all because of how Germany treated Russia. Germany’s Brest-Litovsk treaty to Russia was way harsher than the Treaty of Versailles and they should not complain when they treated others so badly.\nNo evidence or explanation\nAdditionally, some Germans hated that their territories got taken away and the German-speaking people got separated. This wasn’t justified because Austria-Hungary lost two thirds of their land and Germany also took Alsace Lorraine before in the Treaty of Frankfurt.

Explain your answer.\nI agree to some extent that Italy was more responsible for the failure of the League of Nations due to its direct challenges to the League’s authority. Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 was a clear violation of the League’s principles and a bold act of aggression against a fellow member. By invading Abyssinia, Italy showed that it did not fear repercussions from the League, which weakened the organization’s stance on collective security. This invasion set a precedent, signaling to other nations that the League lacked the power to enforce its decisions effectively. Furthermore, Italy’s alliance with Nazi Germany, exemplified by the signing of the Pact of Steel in 1939, further destabilized the League. Italy’s support for Germany’s expansionist policies and disregard for the League’s objectives directly undermined the League’s efforts to maintain peace in Europe, contributing to its eventual breakdown.\nHowever, Britain and France also bear significant responsibility for the League’s failure, as their reluctance to take firm action revealed weaknesses in the organization’s structure. Both countries prioritized their national interests and avoided strong responses to aggression, fearing another large-scale conflict. For example, during the Abyssinia Crisis, Britain and France avoided imposing strict sanctions on Italy, despite its invasion, as they wanted to keep Italy as an ally against potential German aggression. This appeasement and lack of resolve from the League’s leading members highlighted the organization’s inability to enforce collective security. Additionally, Britain and France’s self-interested policies led to inconsistent enforcement of the League’s rules, further eroding its authority. Their unwillingness to commit to military action or robust sanctions against aggressive nations demonstrated the League’s dependency on its most powerful members, contributing significantly to its ineffectiveness and ultimate failure.\n\nBritain and France were to blame for the failure of the League of Nations.\nFirstly, Britain and France’s appeasement policy demonstrated a lack of commitment to the League’s principles, weakening its credibility. When Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935, both countries prioritized diplomatic relations with Italy over enforcing League sanctions. For instance, the Hoare-Laval Pact, secretly proposed by British and French foreign ministers, would have allowed Italy to control large parts of Abyssinia. This willingness to negotiate with aggressors undermined the League’s stance on collective security, showing that Britain and France would rather make concessions than uphold the League’s authority, signaling to other nations that the League lacked true power.\nSecondly, Britain and France’s reluctance to enforce military action significantly weakened the League’s deterrent effect. Both countries were concerned with avoiding another costly war and therefore hesitated to support collective military intervention. For example, when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, Britain and France failed to commit to any significant military or economic response, leaving the League powerless to stop Japanese aggression. This lack of enforcement against member states who broke League rules revealed that the League was essentially toothless without the support of its leading powers, making it easy for other countries to ignore its authority.\nOn the other hand, Italy’s aggressive actions directly challenged the League’s purpose and fueled its downfall. Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia openly violated the League’s mission to protect member states from aggression, yet Italy acted with confidence that the League would not respond effectively. This invasion not only disrupted peace but also showed other nations that the League could not protect its members, eroding trust in the organization. Italy’s defiance and disregard for League rules severely damaged the League’s credibility and emboldened other countries, such as Germany, to pursue aggressive policies without fear of consequences.\nAdditionally, Italy’s alignment with Nazi Germany further destabilized the League and accelerated its collapse. By signing the Pact of Steel with Germany in 1939, Italy demonstrated its support for Germany’s expansionist agenda, which was in direct opposition to the League’s goals of peace and security. This alliance signaled a growing division among European powers, isolating the League and reducing its influence. Italy’s partnership with Germany encouraged aggressive policies across Europe and weakened the League’s authority, contributing to the chain of events leading to World War II.\n\nThe League had its greatest success in its humanitarian work.\nFirstly, the League’s efforts in public health showed its strengths in humanitarian work. The League’s Health Organization made significant progress in combating diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and leprosy. For example, the organization helped coordinate international efforts to improve sanitation and distribute vaccines, reducing the spread of these diseases globally. This work demonstrated the League’s ability to bring nations together for the common good, proving effective in areas where its political influence was limited.\nSecondly, the League’s Refugee Commission exemplified its effectiveness in addressing humanitarian crises. Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission aided displaced people after World War I, including Russian and Greek refugees. The introduction of Nansen passports allowed stateless refugees to cross borders and rebuild their lives, providing thousands with legal recognition and protection. This initiative highlighted the League’s positive impact on individuals affected by conflict and earned it respect for its commitment to humanitarian support.\nHowever, it could be argued that the League’s primary goal was to prevent war, and in this, it largely failed. The League’s core mission was to maintain international peace through collective security, which was not achieved, as evidenced by its failure to stop Japanese aggression in Manchuria or Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia. These failures undermined the League’s credibility as a peacekeeping organization, suggesting that its humanitarian successes were secondary to its primary mission of preventing conflict.\nFurthermore, the League’s humanitarian work was limited in scope and impact compared to its failures in political and military matters. While its health and refugee initiatives were successful, they did not prevent the League from being widely perceived as weak and ineffective on the global stage. For instance, major conflicts leading up to World War II showed the League’s inability to enforce its principles, which overshadowed its achievements in humanitarian areas. This contrast suggests that, while the League’s humanitarian work was important, its inability to fulfill its main purpose compromised its overall success.\n\nThe Depression had a greater impact on the League than did the Manchurian Crisis.\nFirstly, the Great Depression undermined international cooperation by shifting countries’ focus to domestic issues, weakening the League’s influence. The economic hardships caused by the Depression led to high unemployment and poverty worldwide, making nations prioritize their own economic recovery over international obligations. For instance, major powers like Britain and France focused on addressing their internal problems, leaving the League without the unified support needed to handle international crises. This lack of cooperation made the League less effective, as member nations were unwilling to enforce collective security during times of economic hardship.\nSecondly, the Depression contributed to the rise of aggressive, militaristic governments, further challenging the League’s ability to maintain peace. Economic instability led to the growth of authoritarian regimes in countries like Germany and Japan, where leaders promised to restore national pride and economic stability through expansionist policies. Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in 1931, for example, was partly driven by the need for raw materials and resources to support its economy. The League’s inability to control these aggressive powers was rooted in the economic desperation caused by the Depression, which had intensified nationalist ambitions and undermined diplomatic efforts to maintain peace.\nHowever, the Manchurian Crisis itself also had a significant impact on the League by highlighting its lack of enforcement power. When Japan invaded Manchuria, the League condemned the aggression but failed to impose any meaningful consequences or military response. For example, the Lytton Report, which condemned Japan’s actions, took over a year to publish, and Japan simply withdrew from the League when criticized. This failure to respond decisively showed other nations that the League could be defied without repercussions, setting a precedent that greatly weakened its authority and effectiveness as a peacekeeping body.\nAdditionally, the Manchurian Crisis directly damaged the League’s reputation as a credible international organization. The League’s inability to protect a member state from aggression demonstrated its powerlessness and undermined its core principle of collective security. This emboldened other aggressive nations, such as Italy and Germany, who saw the League’s ineffectiveness in Manchuria as an opportunity to pursue their expansionist ambitions. The failure in Manchuria thus contributed significantly to the League’s decline, as it lost credibility and respect among its member states.\n\nThe League of Nations was a success.\nFirstly, the League of Nations made significant progress in addressing humanitarian issues, which highlights its successes in improving global welfare. One of its most notable achievements was the establishment of the Health Organization, which tackled health crises across nations. For example, the League implemented campaigns against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis and organized vaccination programs, significantly reducing the spread of these diseases in various regions. This proactive approach to public health demonstrated the League’s ability to foster international cooperation for humanitarian purposes, marking a key success in its overall legacy.\nSecondly, the League effectively resolved several disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, showcasing its capacity for conflict resolution. Notable examples include the League’s mediation in the dispute between Finland and Sweden over the Aaland Islands in 1921, where the League successfully facilitated a peaceful resolution, and the resolution of the 1925 conflict between Greece and Bulgaria, which saw both nations accept the League’s decisions. These successful interventions underscored the League’s potential as a platform for dialogue and cooperation, preventing conflicts from escalating into wars during the interwar period.\nHowever, despite these successes, the League ultimately struggled to enforce its decisions and maintain peace on a larger scale. Its inability to respond effectively to major aggressions, such as Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, revealed significant weaknesses in its structure and authority. In both cases, the League condemned the actions but failed to impose meaningful sanctions or military interventions. This powerlessness undermined its credibility as a peacekeeping body and raised doubts about its effectiveness, illustrating that the League’s success was limited in scope and could not prevent significant conflicts.\nMoreover, the League’s reliance on collective security was fundamentally flawed, as it required the cooperation of major powers, many of whom were reluctant to engage militarily. The absence of the United States, which chose not to join the League, greatly weakened its influence and ability to enforce decisions. Additionally, the requirement for unanimous decisions made it difficult for the League to act decisively in crises. These structural issues hindered its effectiveness in achieving its primary goal of maintaining international peace, suggesting that while the League had some successes, its overall impact was ultimately diminished by these critical shortcomings.\n\nMussolini was responsible for the destruction of the authority of the League of Nations.\nFirstly, Mussolini’s aggressive foreign policy directly challenged the League’s principles and exposed its weaknesses. His invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 was a blatant violation of the League’s covenant, which aimed to prevent aggression among member states. For example, when the League imposed sanctions on Italy, Mussolini disregarded them and continued his military campaign, illustrating his contempt for the League’s authority. This act of defiance not only undermined the League’s credibility but also demonstrated that it lacked the power to enforce its decisions against aggressive actions taken by a major member state, significantly eroding its authority in the eyes of other nations.\nSecondly, Mussolini’s actions influenced other aggressive nations, further contributing to the League’s decline. By successfully invading Abyssinia without facing serious repercussions, Mussolini set a precedent that encouraged other powers, such as Germany under Hitler, to pursue their own expansionist agendas. This emboldenment was evident in the subsequent remilitarization of the Rhineland by Germany in 1936, which occurred without any effective response from the League. Mussolini’s willingness to flout the League’s authority emboldened other countries to follow suit, leading to a loss of respect for the League and ultimately damaging its effectiveness as a peacekeeping organization.\nHowever, it can be argued that Mussolini was not the sole factor responsible for the destruction of the League’s authority, as the League’s structural weaknesses played a significant role. The League’s reliance on collective security was flawed, as it required the cooperation of major powers who were often reluctant to engage militarily. For instance, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, key members like Britain and France were hesitant to take strong action due to their own interests in maintaining good relations with Mussolini. This lack of unity and resolve among the League’s leading powers weakened its ability to respond effectively to aggression, indicating that internal issues were just as significant in undermining its authority as Mussolini’s actions.\nAdditionally, the League’s failure to respond to earlier crises diminished its credibility before Mussolini’s invasion of Abyssinia. The Manchurian Crisis of 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, was a crucial moment that showcased the League’s impotence. The League condemned Japan’s actions but did not enforce any effective sanctions or military interventions, leading to Japan’s withdrawal from the organization. This earlier failure demonstrated to Mussolini and other aggressive leaders that the League could be ignored, thereby weakening its authority long before the Abyssinia Crisis. Thus, while Mussolini’s actions contributed to the League’s decline, they were part of a broader context of ineffectiveness and lack of support that ultimately led to the League’s failure.\n\nThe organization of the League of Nations was the more important cause of its failure.\nFirstly, the League’s organizational structure was fundamentally flawed, which hindered its effectiveness in addressing conflicts. The requirement for unanimous decisions meant that any single member could block action, leading to paralysis in decision-making. For example, during the Manchurian Crisis in 1931, the League’s response was delayed as member states debated the appropriate course of action. This lack of a decisive mechanism to respond quickly to aggression revealed serious weaknesses in the League’s structure, preventing it from taking effective measures when needed and contributing to its failure.\nSecondly, the League lacked its own armed forces and relied on member nations to provide military assistance. This dependence significantly undermined its authority and ability to enforce its decisions. For instance, when Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935, the League imposed sanctions but had no means to compel compliance or respond militarily. Member states were hesitant to commit troops to League initiatives, fearing that it would draw them into conflicts they wished to avoid. This absence of military power rendered the League ineffective as a peacekeeping body, demonstrating that organizational shortcomings were a critical factor in its failure.\nHowever, it can be argued that the membership of the League was the more significant cause of its failure. The absence of key powers, particularly the United States, severely limited the League’s influence and effectiveness. Without the participation of the U.S., the League struggled to assert itself as a global authority, lacking the support of one of the world’s strongest economies and military powers. For example, the U.S. refusal to join the League not only deprived it of legitimacy but also affected the willingness of other nations to commit fully to the organization, leading to a weakened collective security arrangement.\nAdditionally, the League’s member states often pursued their own national interests over collective goals, further undermining its effectiveness. Countries like Britain and France were reluctant to impose strong measures against aggressor states due to their geopolitical concerns, as seen in their failure to respond decisively to Italian aggression in Abyssinia. This self-interest led to a lack of unity and cooperation among members, making it impossible for the League to function effectively. Therefore, the failure to maintain a cohesive and committed membership was a crucial factor in the League’s ultimate inability to achieve its goals.\n\nIneffective sanctions were the main reason for the failure of the League of Nations.\nFirstly, the League’s reliance on economic sanctions as a primary tool for enforcing its decisions proved to be ineffective against aggressive states. When Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935, the League imposed limited sanctions, but crucial resources such as oil and steel were excluded from the sanctions list. This lack of comprehensive measures allowed Mussolini to continue his military campaign without significant economic repercussions. For example, the ineffectiveness of these sanctions led to the realization among member states that the League could not enforce compliance, severely undermining its authority and credibility as a peacekeeping organization.\nSecondly, the League’s inability to enforce its sanctions demonstrated its structural weaknesses and lack of cohesion among member nations. For instance, during the Manchurian Crisis in 1931, the League condemned Japan’s invasion of Manchuria but failed to impose meaningful sanctions that would compel Japan to withdraw. Instead, Japan simply ignored the League’s resolutions, highlighting the organization’s inability to back its decisions with effective action. This failure to enforce sanctions against a major power set a precedent that encouraged other nations to disregard the League’s authority, showcasing that ineffective sanctions were a critical factor in its overall failure.\nHowever, it can be argued that the League’s fundamental structural issues were a more significant cause of its failure than ineffective sanctions alone. The requirement for unanimous decisions often resulted in inaction, as seen during the League’s response to various crises. For example, in the case of the Manchurian Crisis, the League’s decision-making process was hindered by the need for consensus among member states, which delayed any effective response. This lack of decisive action was rooted in organizational weaknesses rather than solely the ineffectiveness of sanctions, indicating that deeper structural problems contributed significantly to the League’s inability to maintain peace.\nAdditionally, the absence of key member states, particularly the United States, further diminished the League’s effectiveness, complicating its ability to impose sanctions successfully. The lack of U.S. involvement not only deprived the League of significant political and military support but also affected the willingness of other nations to take the League seriously. Without the backing of a major power, sanctions imposed by the League lacked the credibility necessary to compel compliance from aggressive states. Thus, while ineffective sanctions played a role in the League’s failure, the broader context of organizational weaknesses and the absence of crucial member states were equally important factors that contributed to its ultimate ineffectiveness."},"02_areas/HISTORY/02League-of-Nations/practice-questions":{"title":"practice questions","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"a) What was the League of Nations’ Slavery Commission?

We want to avoid a war.\nBecause of the Great Depression, we, Britain, are not in shape for a war. We can go to war, but then we will have to win it or her empire will totally collapse. Our arms are behind from Germany’s secret rearming, I have already advocated and ordered for faster rearming. Because of the Great Depression, the USA also turned to isolationism, they will not help us if all hell breaks out. With Germany being allies with Japan, our colonies might also be threatened. So if we want a war, we are basically alone, without sufficient arms, and can collapse if we lose.\nAfter the first world war, our good citizens of the Great British Empire also sympathizes Germany because of the harsh terms on the Treaty of Versailles. There is also war trauma and a lot of people are not ready for another war nor will they want Germany to not be able to break some of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. Winston Churchill said “An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.” But we are not going to get eaten. To see how the crocodile always eats the food viciously is to remind everyone to get accustomed to the notion that there will be a war. And you have to be ready for it. If we suddenly declare war on Germany right now, there will be public out lash and chaos. By feeding the crocodile, we can slowly see its aims and everyone can see how the crocodile acts. Then, people will be ready for when the crocodile tries to eat them and unite together to fight back.\ngpt fixed version\nAppeasement is the policy of giving in to reasonable demands to avoid war, and right now, it is the most prudent course of action. We do this not out of fear, but to secure peace while we prepare for the future.\nBritain is not ready for another war. The Great Depression has weakened our economy, and we cannot yet match Germany’s rapid rearmament. Though I have already ordered faster rearming, our military still lags behind. The United States has embraced isolationism, and without their support, a conflict would leave us dangerously exposed. Germany’s alliance with Japan also poses a threat to our colonies, stretching our defenses even thinner. To declare war now, with insufficient arms and few allies, risks collapse—not just of Britain but of our entire Empire.\nWe must also acknowledge the mood of the nation. After the devastation of the Great War, our people are wary of another conflict. Many even sympathize with Germany, believing the Treaty of Versailles imposed overly harsh conditions. This is not the time to force the public into a war they do not yet support.\nSome, like Mr. Churchill, have said, “An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.” But I believe this analogy oversimplifies the reality. Appeasement is not about feeding the crocodile indefinitely; it is about buying time to understand its movements, to arm ourselves, and to prepare the nation for the challenges ahead.\nThe policy of appeasement allows us to see Germany’s intentions clearly. It gives us the opportunity to strengthen our defenses and to rally the people for when conflict becomes unavoidable. If and when the crocodile turns to attack, Britain will be united, armed, and ready to fight back."},"02_areas/HISTORY/03Hitler's-foreign-policy-and-WW2/Response-to-the-TOV":{"title":"Response to the TOV","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"www.savemyexams.com/igcse/history/cie/18/revision-notes/the-20th-century-international-relations-from-1919/was-hitlers-foreign-policy-to-blame-for-the-second-world-war/the-long-term-consequences-of-the-treaty-of-versailles/"},"02_areas/HISTORY/03Hitler's-foreign-policy-and-WW2/Steps-into-WW2":{"title":"Steps into WW2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"1933-1939\nBrief Description of Event\nContribution to WW2\nWhy Appeased\n1933\nCountries were still in an economic depression\nHitler became chancellor.\n\nbegan secretly rearming\ntook Germany out of the LON\nHitler’s foreign policies\n\nTo abolish the TOV\nLebensraum\nUnite German speakers\nDefeat communism\nManchurian Crisis\n\n\nshowed inefficiency of LON because of organization\nineffectiveness of LON because of membership\nHitler and Mussolini took notice on how aggression was ‘permitted’\n\nHitler’s policies laid the groundwork for expansionist actions and aggressive nationalism undermining post-WWI peace.\nThe failure of the LON to respond to the Manchurian crisis emboldened aggressive powers like Germany and Italy.\nThe Manchurian Crisis was appeased because it was too far away, and Britain and France lacked the resources and political will to stop it.

Whereas source B explains that Stalin was always suspicious and clearly rejected the plan as a ‘trick by Truman’ and was doing the aid just to infiltrate European countries.\nAlthough the sources disagree, this is not surprising because Source A is from a British history book in the 1980s, not containing any quotes or references, so it is the comprehension of the writer or editors of the book, meaning that they must not have all the details.

Truman in source A explains that US foreign policy aims to support freedom and democracy by opposing soviet control. This is shown in the quote ‘I believe that is must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation’. Source B on the other hand explains that Truman’s policy is a ‘smokescreen’ for ‘expansion’. Izevestia compares the US rhetoric to Nazi comments about the USSR, and claims the US is trying to take control of Greece and Turkey.\nAlthough the sources disagree over the aims of US foreign policy, source A does not make source B surprising. Source A is a speech by President Truman in which he is defending his foreign policy actions and will therefore glorify the position on the United States and demonize the Soviet Union. Source B on the other hand is a Soviet newspaper. In 1947, Stalin was in the process of cementing control over Eastern Europe, and Trumans’ policies could potentially act as an obstacle to the further spread of communism. It is therefore unsurprising that the Izvesti denounced US policy.\nOverall, although sources A and B disagree, source A does not make source B surprising."},"02_areas/HISTORY/04The-Cold-War/President-Truman-was-mainly-responsible-for-the-start-of-the-Cold-war-PartC":{"title":"President Truman was mainly responsible for the start of the Cold war PartC","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"‘President Truman was mainly responsible for the start of the Cold War.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.\n\ntwo full explanations for the responsibility of Truman\nTwo full explanations of other factors\nConclusion evaluating how far you agree with the statement\n\nTruman may be partly responsible for the start of the Cold War because of his aggressive anti-communist stance and attitude towards the USSR. Truman had a very aggressive containment policy towards the Soviets including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and Bizonia, all are provocatively designed to isolate and contain the USSR. Truman also did not tell the USSR about their atomic bomb, and chose to reveal it in the Potsdam meeting. Thinking that they can control and dictate the meeting because of their atomic dominance. These aggressive acts provokes the USSR and their ideology. The concealment and use of the atomic bomb does not give the USSR any reason to continue their alliance or trust the West.\nTruman was partly responsible for the start of the Cold War because of the introduction and implementation of Marshall Aid. Marshall Aid was money given out for free to economically damaged countries post World War 2, so that countries can redevelop faster without a volatile economy. Marshall Aid in total handed out $13.3 billion, the US said that they provided this aid to prevent the European economy from totally collapsing. However, its true purpose can be said was to create American influence within those struggling countries that rely on the US, therefore the US can also have markets in those countries and influence those countries decisions. They wanted the preservation of a capitalistic economy and to further their ideological agenda that was portrayed as an act of philanthropy and charity. This made the USSR worry about America using ‘dollar imperialism’ to expand into western Europe, which massively increased tensions between the two countries and ideology.\nHowever, another big contributor of the start of the Cold War can also be the USSR leaving the Red Army in Eastern European countries and using terror to install forced communist governments. Stalin set up the Cominform, banned opposition, and killed opponents to impose communist regimes. The act of forcefully making communist satellite countries and not holding fair, free elections broke the Yalta agreement and was a clear sign that Stalin wanted to undermine capitalism. The US saw this as Stalin wanted to dominate the entirety of Eastern Europe and later the whole of Europe while forcing them under the Soviet Communists’ wing, making the US worry what was going on behind ‘the iron curtain’ and what aggressive expansionist act Stalin will do next.\nFurthermore, Stalin further shares the responsibility for the Cold War because he imposed the Berlin Blockade as an deliberate attempt to drive the three powers out of west Berlin and gain total control of eastern Germany. The Berlin Blockade was designed to block all supplies from going into west Berlin so that the people there will eventually have to seek Soviet help, forcing out western influence. This was an obvious and clear act of defying the agreements and control another part of eastern Europe, creating problems for the west and tension, as the wrong response from the west can lead to war.\nOverall, Truman was partially at blame for the Cold War because of his aggressive stance and implementation of a plan that furthers the US’s influence throughout Europe, but the blame can be shared with Stalin’s equally or more aggressive acts and betrayal against agreements."},"02_areas/HISTORY/04The-Cold-War/Speech-Opposing-the-Marshall-Plan":{"title":"Speech Opposing the Marshall Plan","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Marshall Plan should not be launched, it is an economic aid for lands far far away, while the intentions behind this plan may sound noble and just, I come before you to voice my opposition.\nThe core of this plan, is money.

Proponents say no, they want to leave this problem for rich billionaires that later on that rise from our capitalistic society, and hope they can fix it while managing their own media platform, several companies and 13 children without a conflict of interest to reverse what could be tens of trillions of debt decades later. Should the average American worker be beaten to dig deeper into their own wallets to subsidize for others instead of fixing our own government and ideology?\nMoreover, involving ourselves deeply into the affairs of other nations has no good outcome.

The onion buildings represent Moscow, and the lasso means their control over Czechoslovakia. The big message in the cartoon is that Moscow has a loose control around Czechoslovakia right now, but they can tighten and grip Czechoslovakia when they want to. The title of the cartoon is “when the time is right”, suggesting that they will inevitably turn Czechoslovakia into a communist state under the Cominform.\nThe cartoon is for Americans and published in 1947. The purpose of the cartoon is to influence the American viewers to dislike the USSR because of their salami tactics and urge people to persuade Congress to take immediate action. The cartoon wants to change the American people’s minds of the threat of the expansion of Soviet influence is immediate. This cartoon was published in 1947 because at the time Czechoslovakia was not considered to be eastern-Europe and they were about to be taken over by Soviets, so Congress was deciding whether to provide aid or not and whether they will still follow the policy of isolationism, and they needed to gain America support.\nWhy was this cartoon published in Eastern Europe in 1947?\n\nIn the source, we see a figure riding a cow, the Marshall plan, from Wall Street to Europe. The figure is a member of the American government and he is being watched by the members of the British and French government. The cow is being milked at Wall Street. The message this shows is that the USA is using the Marshall plan to have more influence over Europe and later will milk Europe dry, generating them money and France and Britain does not oppose this as they want Marshall aid. Marshall aid is money provided to countries that want it and the US will create markets in those countries for them to later trade with, so at the end, the US will end up with more markets to deal in and gain financially instead of this aid being totally charity.\nThe cartoon was published in Eastern Europe in 1947 to influence people to see the Marshall plan as an act of US expansion and them wanting more domination over Europe and not because they totally want to help.  This is seen in the cartoon where there is a safe behind the cow being milked, highlighting that any financial benefits will go to the US only and not the British and French governments shown, who’s land seems to be getting devoured by the cow. The cartoon wants people to reject the Marshall plan as in 1947 the US is starting negotiations and introducing Marshall aid to countries."},"02_areas/HISTORY/05Containment/00_MOC":{"title":"00_MOC","links":["02_areas/HISTORY/05Containment/How-Effectively-did-the-USA-contain-the-spread-of-Communism"],"tags":[],"content":"How Effectively did the USA contain the spread of Communism?"},"02_areas/HISTORY/05Containment/Cuban-Missile-Crisis":{"title":"Cuban Missile Crisis","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How did the US react to revolution in Cuba?\nErnesto ‘Che’ Guevara\n\nArgentine Marxist Revolutionary\nGuerrilla leader\nmajor figure in Cuban revolution\nstrategist for Castro\nbelieved in armed, forced revolution\nbelieved communism will succeed if most of the world were\nexecuted later\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1898, Americans helped Cubans become independent from Spain’s colonial rule.\nUS built large naval base at Guantanamo and invested heavily in Cuban industry.\nThey also started controlling stakes, forcing relations, finances\n1934, aided Batista to dictator → because he was not communist\nBatista became a symbol for Cubans of US control\nCuba is located near the US, southern, 100km away, very close.\nFidel Castrol\n1959, after a 3 year campaign, he overthrew Batista\n\nknocked down or out opponents\npropaganda, charming, clever, ruthless\ncommunist/socialist\n\n\nUS response:\nCut investment\nCIA investigate how to overthrow - 1960 June\nreduce trade\nsupport exiles, damage plantations, US companies no work with Cuban businesses\nmedia broadcasted propaganda\nCuban exiles and US business owners whose businesses were taken: pressured US to fight back\nCastro allowed US to keep naval base.\nSoviet Union $100 million in aid, Cuba received advanced arms too, US spies knew this.\nCuba became powerful in Latin America\n1961 January, new US president, John F.

The US public put pressure on the government to protect South KoreaDistrust of the USSRThe USA blamed the USSR for North Korea’s actions. The USSR  had acted aggressively in Eastern Europe and blockaded BerlinBelief in victoryThe US government believed that China would not react if they sent troops to Korea. They hoped that they could persuade the UN to provide military support to South Korea\nPart B Practice\nWhy did the US intervene in the War?\nThe US mainly intervened to stop communism from spreading because they believed in the Domino Theory. The Domino Theory states that if one country falls in Asia, other will follow. So, they do not want South Korea to fall to prevent other countries from falling into communism next, as per the containment policy.\nAnother reason the US intervened was to activate the United Nations. It is seen as North Koreans were the unprovoked aggressors, and to stop the mistakes the LON previously did of appeasement, the US led the UN to combat, making the UN of use and also setting an example that aggression will not be tolerated.\nAnother reason was that South Korea was located in a strategic place. South Korea has a geopolitical advantage being near the newly communist China and the USSR with a sea by its side as well.

Instead, the Viet Cong:- Set traps    - Ambushed soldiers    - Used Vietnam’s forests to attack and hide    - Dug tunnels    The USA struggled to fight against these tacticsUse of civiliansMany South Vietnamese citizens helped the Viet Cong. They attacked South Vietnamese government officials. The Viet Cong did not wear a military uniform. As a result, US soldiers struggled to identify troops from civiliansHo Chi Minh TrailThe North Vietnamese used the Ho Chi Minh Trail to transport supplies.

During the war, the USA dropped three million tonnes of bombsChemical warfareThe USA had a huge technological advantage over the North Vietnamese. They used chemicals like Napalm and Agent Orange. The aim was to destroy the dense forest that the Viet Cong hid in. This type of warfare caused high civilian casualtiesConscriptionFrom 1967, the US government introduced conscription (or ‘the draft’). A large proportion of the US Army were young and Black Americans. Most of these soldiers had no choice but to fight in Vietnam. This meant that the US soldiers had low morale and wanted to return to the USASearch and DestroyThe US sent troops in helicopters to find and attack Viet Cong bases. This method caused many deaths. Viet Cong traps killed US soldiers. US troops attacked innocent villagers in the belief they were Viet Cong. Search and Destroy pushed many Vietnamese to support the Viet Cong\nWhy Did Public Opinion Turn Against the Vietnam War?\n\n\nThe US public turned against the Vietnam War because:\n\n\nConscription was unpopular\n\n\nAround 2.8 million US soldiers fought in Vietnam\n\n\nThe draft affected black Americans disproportionately\n\n\nThe police prosecuted over 9,000 young men for ‘draft dodging’ \n\n\n\n\nThe Tet Offensive (1968) caused the media to question if the war was worthwhile\n\n\nIt was the first televised war\n\n\nThe US public saw photographs and news reports of the Vietnam War in graphic detail\n\n\nScandals like the My Lai Massacre were uncovered, changing the public’s perception of the US Army\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-war protests peaked 1968-70\n\n\nStudents were the key opposition group to the war\n\n\nIn November 1969, 700,000 anti-war protesters marched in Washington\n\n\nIn May 1970, the National Guard shot dead four student protestors at Kent State University\n\n\nThe media coverage of the shootings caused 2 million students in 400 schools to go on strike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture of a student protest at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, January 1965\n\nA photograph showing an American man and woman watching footage of the Vietnam War on a television in their living room in 1968\nThe Consequences of the End of the Vietnam War\n\n\nPresident Nixon won the 1968 presidential election on the promise to end the Vietnam War\n\nNixon and his National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, wanted to pull out of the war with dignity\n\n\n\nAfter the unsuccessful bombing campaigns of Laos and Cambodia, Nixon began the process of US withdrawal\n\n\nIn January 1973, the US and the North Vietnamese government signed the Paris Peace Accords\n\n\nThis officially ended US involvement in Vietnam\n\n\nNixon declared the US withdrawal was ‘peace with honour’\n\n\n\n\nBy 1973, only 30,000 US troops remained in Vietnam\n\nThe conflict between North and South Vietnam continued\n\n\n\nOn 30th April 1975, the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, fell to North Vietnamese forces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive consequencesNegative consequencesThe US public was happy to see the end of the ‘unwinnable war’Containment had failed militarily. While the USA had stronger weapons, the communist Viet Cong had better tacticsContainment had failed politically. By 1975, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia became Communist. The USSR and China, who had given money and technology to North Vietnam, had gained new Communist alliesContainment had failed in the propaganda war. The use of chemical warfare and disregard for Vietnamese civilians ruined the USA’s international reputation. Over 58,000 US soldiers died with millions of Vietnamese casualtiesContainment had failed economically.

The USA wanted to protect Japan’s capitalismTruman DoctrineIn 1947, Truman declared that the USA would protect any country in threat of a Communist uprising. The US public put pressure on the government to protect South KoreaDistrust of the USSRThe USA blamed the USSR for North Korea’s actions. The USSR  had acted aggressively in Eastern Europe and blockaded BerlinBelief in victoryThe US government believed that China would not react if they sent troops to Korea. They hoped that they could persuade the UN to provide military support to South Korea\nPart B Practice\nWhy did the US intervene in the War?\nThe US mainly intervened to stop communism from spreading because they believed in the Domino Theory. The Domino Theory states that if one country falls in Asia, other will follow. So, they do not want South Korea to fall to prevent other countries from falling into communism next, as per the containment policy.\nAnother reason the US intervened was to activate the United Nations. It is seen as North Koreans were the unprovoked aggressors, and to stop the mistakes the LON previously did of appeasement, the US led the UN to combat, making the UN of use and also setting an example that aggression will not be tolerated.\nAnother reason was that South Korea was located in a strategic place. South Korea has a geopolitical advantage being near the newly communist China and the USSR with a sea by its side as well.

While Source B states that the ‘people in Hungary were absolutely against the Stalinist elements still in power’. The two sources disagree over the support of Hungarians for reform, showing the clear difference of the dissidents and decadents wants to view the situation in.\nThis disagreement of events and Hungarian views is not surprising because Source A was from Khrushchev’s, the Soviet leader at that time, personal memoirs of events and Source B was from the President of Yugoslavia who previously disobeyed the Cominform. Khrushchev, being a communist man, will definitely steer towards justifying his actions and suppression of the Hungarian Uprising that caused 4000 people to die. President Tito will show a more clear perspective from opponents of the USSR of how they feel about Soviet control.\nAlthough the sources disagree, due to the provenance and context, Source A does not make Source B surprising.\nModel answer.\nbro did not send one\n\nExample Part C Questions:\n“‘The Soviet Union’s desire for security was the main reason for its control over Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1989.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.”\nFocus: Motivations.\nWhat to consider: Security (buffer zone), ideology (spread of communism), economic benefits, fear of Western influence. You’d need to weigh these against each other.\n“To what extent was Soviet military force the most important factor in maintaining control over Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1981 (before Gorbachev)?”\nFocus: Methods of control and their effectiveness.\nWhat to consider: Military interventions (Hungary ‘56, Czechoslovakia ‘68), presence of Red Army, economic ties (Comecon), political control (Cominform, loyal local leaders), propaganda, secret police, versus the underlying desire for independence in satellite states.\n“Which event was a more serious challenge to Soviet authority in Eastern Europe: the Hungarian Uprising (1956) or the Prague Spring (1968)? Explain your answer.”\nFocus: Comparing opposition movements.\nWhat to consider: Aims of the reformers/rebels, nature of the challenge (armed revolt vs. internal reform), Soviet response, immediate and longer-term consequences for Soviet control and for the respective countries.\n“‘The Berlin Wall was a symbol of Cold War division but ultimately a failure for the Soviet Union.’ How far do you agree with this statement?”\nFocus: Significance and consequences of the Berlin Wall.\nWhat to consider: Short-term “successes” (stopping refugee flow, stabilizing GDR economy), long-term propaganda disaster, symbol of oppression, its eventual fall as a symbol of Soviet collapse.\n“How important was the Solidarity movement in Poland in the eventual collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe?”\nFocus: Role of a specific opposition movement in the broader decline.\nWhat to consider: Solidarity’s initial successes, its suppression, its survival underground, its role in inspiring other movements, how it demonstrated the limits of Soviet power, alongside other factors like economic problems, Gorbachev’s reforms, etc.\n“‘Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies were the main reason for the collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe by 1989.’ How far do you agree with this statement?”\nFocus: Factors leading to the collapse, with emphasis on Gorbachev.\nWhat to consider: Glasnost, Perestroika, Sinatra Doctrine, ending of Brezhnev Doctrine, versus long-term economic weaknesses in the USSR and satellite states, nationalist sentiments, the impact of earlier resistance (Solidarity, Charter 77), Western pressure.\n“Assess the consequences of Soviet control for the people of Eastern Europe between 1948 and 1989. In your answer, consider both positive and negative impacts.”\nFocus: Impact on daily life, society, and economy.\nWhat to consider: Negative: lack of freedom, repression, economic shortages, environmental damage, suppression of national identity. Positive (from a Soviet perspective or limited actual benefits): stability (enforced), industrialization (though often inefficient), education/literacy improvements in some areas, social welfare (though often basic). The question asks for an assessment, so a judgment on the overall balance is needed.\n“To what extent did economic factors drive both the USSR’s desire to control Eastern Europe and the opposition to that control?”\nFocus: The role of economics as a motivator and a source of discontent.\nWhat to consider: USSR’s motivations: resources, markets, Comecon integration, reparations (early on). Opposition: economic hardship, shortages, desire for better living standards, resentment at resources being diverted to the USSR, strikes (e.g., Poland).\n“‘Opposition to Soviet control in Eastern Europe was consistently met with overwhelming force and was therefore entirely unsuccessful until the late 1980s.’ How far do you agree with this statement?”\nFocus: Effectiveness and nature of opposition over time.\nWhat to consider: Examples of force (Hungary ‘56, Czechoslovakia ‘68, martial law in Poland). Were there any successes, however small or temporary, before the late 1980s? (e.g., Gomulka’s reforms in Poland ‘56, Kadar’s “goulash communism” in Hungary after ‘56, the very existence and survival of Solidarity). The “entirely unsuccessful” part is key to challenge.\n“Compare and contrast the reasons for Soviet intervention in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968). Which intervention posed a greater threat to the unity of the Soviet bloc?”\nFocus: Comparing specific crises and their implications.\nWhat to consider: Hungary: Nagy’s reforms (multi-party system, Warsaw Pact withdrawal). Czechoslovakia: Dubcek’s “socialism with a human face” (less radical initially but feared contagion). Threat to unity: Hungary’s explicit Warsaw Pact withdrawal vs. Czechoslovakia’s potential to inspire wider reform movements within the bloc.\n“Explain why the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 was a turning point in the Cold War in Europe.”\nFocus: Significance of a specific event as a turning point.\nWhat to consider: What changed after the Wall? Stabilized East Germany (short-term), ended the Berlin Crisis (for a while), became a potent symbol of division, solidified the Iron Curtain, shifted Cold War focus to other areas (e.g., Cuba).\n“‘The decline of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was inevitable by the early 1980s, even before Gorbachev came to power.’ How far do you agree with this statement?”\nFocus: Inevitability and timing of the decline.\nWhat to consider: Long-term factors: economic stagnation in USSR and Eastern Bloc, rising nationalism, appeal of the West, impact of Helsinki Accords, ongoing dissent (Solidarity, Charter 77). Argue whether these factors alone would have led to collapse without Gorbachev’s specific policies.\n“To what extent was the collapse of Soviet control over Eastern Europe a result of internal pressures within the satellite states, rather than changes within the Soviet Union itself?”\nFocus: Internal vs. External factors for the collapse.\nWhat to consider: Internal pressures: desire for national sovereignty, economic dissatisfaction, popular protests, role of dissident groups, religious influence (e.g., Catholic Church in Poland). Changes in USSR: Gorbachev’s reforms, economic weakness of USSR, willingness to let go.

On January 22 1905, peaceful protestors were fire upon by troops, killing hundreds. This made the already discontent Russians angry. The Tsar, who was their ‘Little Father’ as per the Orthodox Churches teachings, had allowed the peaceful marchers to be killed. This turned citizens loyalty into anger and distrust, leading to strikes and protests all across Russia.\nFurthermore, Bloody Sunday united different groups of people in opposition for protesting. They united groups of workers, peasants, and students , who all joined in the mass demonstrations after the massacre together. This made it a nationwide movement with around 200,000 people marching together, showcasing the widespread discontent and desire for change, causing the 1905 Revolution because it  created a nationwide unity against the Tsar.\nHowever, a further cause of the 1905 Revolution was the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Russia’s humiliating defeats showed the government’s weaknesses. Russia being a large country could not even defeat a small country like Japanese. To add salt to injury, not only did they lose, the war also created food shortages and economic hardship for the citizens at home. This caused the Revolution because it increased anger at the Tsar’s incompetence and made people more willing to protest as the discontent had been long term and this was another further short term trigger.\nAnother problem that lead to the 1905 Revolution was the economic problems. The long term poor economic conditions made living conditions unbearable and painful. Russia in 1905 was still a poor agricultural Empire with the rest of the world already gone by then. They had only 4% of the population as urban workers, and more than half peasants. Wages were low, production was low, and efficiency was also low. These economic conditions led people to be frustrated with the Tsar’s planning for the Russian Economy, slowing feeding people’s discontent towards the Tsar.\nOverall, Bloody Sunday was the spark that triggered the revolution. However, it was only successful in causing revolution because of the long-term problems of land hunger, economic hardship, and the failures of the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, Bloody Sunday was responsible but not to a large extent.\n\nHow far were the events of Bloody Sunday responsible for the revolution of 1905? \nBloody Sunday was the spark that ignited the people of Russia into revolution in 1905, however the economic problems Russia faced were the root cause of discontent with The Tsar.  Therefore Bloody Sunday was responsible to a small extent because if it had not happened another trigger would have caused The Revolution. \nBloody Sunday was responsible for the events of 1905 because the march of peasants and workers demanding reform was unprecedented in Russia.  On the 22nd January 1905, 200,000 civilians marched on the Winter palace, demanding changes to the Tsar’s economic and foreign policies.  A demonstration this large proved how unhappy the Russian people were with the current autocratic system, in a country where opposition to The Tsar was illegal.  This initial mobilization of the Russian people set a precedent which allowed further mobilization to continue throughout the year. \nBloody Sunday was also responsible for the events of 1905 because the Tsar’s response to the march on The Winter Palace turned the Russian people against his rule.  The workers petition organised by Father Gapon although demanding improved living and working conditions such as an 8 hour working day, actually supported the continued rule of the Tsar.  However after the army fired on the peaceful marching civilians by orders from The Tsar, it changed the public’s perception of their monarch.  The once peaceful protesters turned violent and stopped asking for reform and called instead for revolution.  The changed perception of Government were taken advantage of by Political Parties such as the Social Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks who organised Soviets and co-ordinate the workers’ political activity, which presented a real challenge to The Tsar’s Autocratic rule during 1905. \nAlthough Bloody Sunday was the spark of the Revolution, there were deeper causes.  The poor economic conditions was what drove the workers of St Petersburg out to petition The Tsar in January 1905.  Russia in 1905 was still a poor agricultural Empire with only 4% of the population working in Industry.  Government reforms under the finance minister Witte between 1890 and 1903 had encouraged Russia to have a ‘Great Spurt’ in it’s economic growth with industrial output booming, but by 1903 the economy had fallen into recession.  The recent arrivals in St Petersburg who had come looking for work, could find none and consequently fell into poverty.  It was these economic conditions that had led people to be disgruntled with The Tsar’s handling of the Economy and to petition The Tsar, leading to Bloody Sunday and the events of 1905.  This was therefore a greater cause than Bloody Sunday itself. \nThe Russo- Japanese war further heightened the economic difficulties Russia was facing in 1905 causing greater opposition to The Tsar.  The decision to go to war, ironically, was initially taken by The Tsar to gain support from the people of Russia and distract them from the tough economic circumstances The Empire was facing.  However The War had the opposite effect; Russia was decisively defeated by the Japanese, with its Baltic fleet totally wiped out by the superior Japanese navy, the first time in History an Asian power had defeated a European rival.  The War was not only humiliating for Nicholas II, but worsened the conditions for Russians, as food was diverted away from cities such as St Petersburg, forcing bread prices to rise, heightening discontent in a population already suffering economic hardships.  The lack of faith in the Tsars decisions and worsening conditions in the major cities led to the Revolution of 1905. \nBloody Sunday was the spark that ignited the people of Russia into revolution in 1905, however the Economic problems Russia faced were the root cause of the discontent.  Therefore Bloody Sunday was responsible to a small extent because if it had not happened another trigger would have caused The Revolution."},"02_areas/HISTORY/Extended-Learning":{"title":"Extended Learning","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Extended learning for History 2023-24 \nHodder Review Magazines - \nThe Hodder review magazine has started a new platform since October 2022.

Explain your answer. One reason why appeasement seemed reasonable at the time was because many in Britain saw the Soviet Union as a greater threat than Nazi Germany. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the spread of communism had caused widespread fear across Europe. The British political elite were especially alarmed by the idea of communist revolution spreading westwards. The USSR’s hostility to capitalism and past attempts to encourage worldwide revolution contributed to its reputation as an unpredictable and dangerous power. In contrast, Hitler was seen by some as a buffer against Soviet expansion, particularly as he was outspoken in his anti-communist views. To many British policymakers, it made sense to allow Germany to grow in strength as a means of containing Stalin’s influence in Eastern Europe. This perspective made concessions to Hitler appear pragmatic rather than reckless, especially since Britain did not want to be dragged into a conflict that might benefit the USSR.\nAnother reason why appeasement appeared reasonable was that it gave Britain more time to rearm. After the First World War, Britain had significantly reduced its military spending, and public opinion was strongly against entering another war. By the early 1930s, the British armed forces were not prepared for a major conflict. The policy of appeasement, particularly under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, was seen as a way to delay war while British defences were rebuilt. For example, the Royal Air Force was in the process of modernising its fighter planes, and radar systems were still being developed. The extra time gained through negotiations with Germany, such as the Munich Agreement of 1938, was used to strengthen the country’s military capabilities. From this perspective, appeasement was a temporary but necessary policy while Britain prepared for the possibility of a future war.\nHowever, appeasement was also unreasonable because it encouraged Hitler to become more aggressive and confident. By continually giving in to his demands—such as allowing German rearmament in 1935, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, and the Anschluss with Austria in 1938—Britain and France sent the message that they were unwilling to confront Nazi expansion. This emboldened Hitler to push further, culminating in the occupation of the Sudetenland and eventually the whole of Czechoslovakia. Each success without consequences increased Hitler’s confidence in his ability to achieve his goals through intimidation and force. In effect, appeasement allowed Germany to grow militarily and strategically stronger, making the eventual war more difficult for Britain and its allies. It also undermined the credibility of Britain’s commitment to defend smaller nations, which would later prove critical when Germany invaded Poland in 1939.\nAppeasement was also unreasonable because it alienated the Soviet Union, especially after the Munich Conference in 1938. At Munich, Britain and France agreed to allow Hitler to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia without consulting the Soviet Union, despite it being an ally of Czechoslovakia. This exclusion demonstrated to Stalin that the Western powers were not interested in a united front against Germany and were even willing to sacrifice smaller states to avoid war. As a result, the USSR became increasingly distrustful of Britain and France, contributing to its decision to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact in 1939. This non-aggression agreement between Germany and the USSR shocked the world and allowed Hitler to invade Poland without fear of a two-front war. Had Britain worked more closely with the Soviet Union instead of appeasing Hitler, it is possible that a stronger alliance could have deterred German aggression.\nIn conclusion, while appeasement may have seemed reasonable to many at the time—especially given the fear of communism and the desire to avoid war while rearming—it ultimately had serious negative consequences. It strengthened Hitler, undermined collective security, and pushed the USSR towards a pact with Nazi Germany. Therefore, although there were reasons for the policy, its long-term impact suggests that it was ultimately an unreasonable and dangerous approach.\n‘How different was the reaction of the USSR to the uprisings in Hungary and Czechoslovakia?’ Explain your answer.\nOne key similarity in the Soviet response to both Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 was the use of military force to suppress reform. In both cases, the USSR sent troops to maintain control over its Eastern European satellite states and to prevent any weakening of the Warsaw Pact. In Hungary, Soviet forces invaded after Prime Minister Imre Nagy attempted to introduce multi-party democracy and declared the country’s intention to leave the Warsaw Pact. In Czechoslovakia, Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops entered the country in response to Dubček’s liberalising reforms during the Prague Spring. These actions demonstrated the Brezhnev Doctrine in practice: no Warsaw Pact country would be allowed to turn away from socialism or Soviet influence.\nHowever, the level of violence used by the USSR was very different in the two cases. In Hungary, the Soviet response was swift and brutal. Around 3,000 people were killed during the invasion and subsequent fighting, and over 200,000 fled the country. Nagy was later executed. The violence was designed to crush resistance and send a clear warning to other states. In contrast, the invasion of Czechoslovakia saw less bloodshed. Though tanks rolled into Prague and there were protests, most resistance was non-violent, and casualties were much lower—around 70–100 people were killed. The contrast shows that while both interventions relied on force, the Hungarian uprising was met with far more severe violence and repression.\nAnother similarity is that in both cases, the USSR initially tolerated some reforms—as long as they didn’t threaten Soviet control or the dominance of the Communist Party. In Hungary, Nagy’s early proposals focused on reforming the economy and improving political freedoms within a socialist framework. Similarly, Dubček’s Prague Spring reforms included greater press freedom, more local economic decision-making, and a more open political climate—termed “socialism with a human face.” Both leaders began their reforms without initially seeking to abandon communism altogether, and for a short time, the USSR allowed these changes to proceed.\nNevertheless, there were differences in how far reforms were ultimately tolerated. In Hungary, when Nagy pushed too far by legalising other political parties and announcing Hungary’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, the USSR responded with overwhelming force. The reforms were completely reversed, and a hardline regime under Kádár was imposed. In Czechoslovakia, although Dubček was removed from power, the rollback of reforms was more gradual. Some of his policies remained in place for a time under Gustáv Husák, and the transition back to stricter control—known as “normalisation”—was less violent and more controlled. This suggests a more flexible and strategic Soviet approach in 1968 compared to the rigid and punitive response in 1956.\nIn conclusion, the Soviet response to both uprisings was similar in its core aim: to maintain control over the Eastern Bloc through military intervention and to limit reform. However, key differences lie in the extent of violence used and how far reforms were tolerated or reversed. While both cases reflected Soviet intolerance of deviation from its model of socialism, the harsher, more violent response in Hungary marked it as more extreme than the reaction in Czechoslovakia.\n\nSource Question The cartoon was published to persuade the British to oppose the harshest terms put forward by the French at\n\nthe Paris peace conference. The cartoonists message is that the Paris Peace conference is dominated by France who are aiming to strip bare the German Nation and use it’s resources for French benefit, by imposing terms that are completely unreasonable. This is shown in the source where Clemenceau, is represented as a chef with the title of ‘Peace conference’ pinned to him, is plucking the German imperial Eagle in the French Foreign ministry, as though it were a chicken in a kitchen. The feathers that have been plucked represent the terms of the treaty, imposing harsh military restrictions, leaving the Eagle naked, humiliated, and lifeless ready for the cooking pot, and eventually to be consumed and by France. This represents the reality of the Paris peace conference in which the French leadership wanted to punish Germany severely for the damage The War had inflicted upon France, with the Prime Minister Ponticare even proposing to dismantle the German state entirely. The purpose of the publication in March 1919 in Britain, three months before the Treaty of Versailles was finalized, was to persuade the British that the French demands were unreasonable, and to

Acting as a team of engineers, your group will propose a realistic and safe solution that could be used in emergency situations. This project is part of the Mechanics unit in Mathematics, and it challenges you to apply your knowledge of kinematics, forces, and friction to create and justify your design using accurate mathematical modeling and calculations. You will also present your solution through a PowerPoint presentation, showcasing your teamwork, logic, and problem-solving skills. The goal is to think critically, work collaboratively, and bring math to life in a real-world scenario.\n \n�� Aims of the Project\nStudents can apply their knowledge of kinematics, forces in two dimensions, and friction to create an emergency exit slide that allows a person to land safely at a target distance. You can analyze the forces involved, the angle of the ramp, and the materials needed to ensure safe operation. To make it life-related, you can research real exit slides and consider factors like environmental impact, safety considerations, and the applicability of such facilities in different contexts.\n�� Rules and Deadlines\n· Plagiarism: Any instance of plagiarism will result in a grade of 0.\n· First Draft Submission:\nWeek 6 (22nd–26th September), as decided by the subject teacher.\n· Extended Deadline:\nWeek 8 (6th–10th October).\no Work submitted late without an acceptable reason will receive a maximum of 50% of the marks if handed in by the extended deadline.\no Work submitted after the extended deadline will receive a grade of 0.\n· Group Project Presentation:\nWeek 9 (13th–17th October).\no Each group will present for 8–10 minutes.\n��️ Task\nA. Build emergency exit slides at SCIE campus. State the following clearly:\n\n\nHeight and length of the exit slides\n\n\nSafety measures you have considered in your design.\n\n\nAny other assumptions and considerations such as friction coefficient used etc. (We can assume frictional coefficient to be constant throughout the motion to make it easier)\n\n\nB. Based on your design and considerations, using your knowledge from Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 in mechanics, please show clearly the calculations to support your design. You may simplify the model if the calculation is beyond your capability. It must include:\na. The speed when each student reaches the bottom and whether it is within safety limit. (The medical team will be worried if it is too fast)\nb. The total time to evacuate 30 students. (If it is too long, then walking the stairs will be preferred)\nc. The forces the slide exerts on the wall as well as on the ground when it is in operation. (School property management needs to consider these)\nd. Any other calculations and considerations such as costs.\nC. Using PowerPoint, do a short presentation of your group design, showing all the above information in your presentation. All the group members must present as presentation grade will be awarded individually.\n�� Hint: To make the calculations easier, you can make reasonable assumptions such as constant frictional coefficient and linear movement when going down the slope.\n�� Mark Allocation\nTotal Mark: 30 Shown below is the detailed composition of the marks, broken down into 3 categories.\n�� Marking Scheme\n�� (A i) Subject Knowledge – 5 Marks\n• The location and setup of the exit slides must be realistic such as materials used for the slides as well as the height and length.

no resultant force.\nUnbalanced Forces: Forces do not cancel out, resulting in a net force in one or more directions.\n\n\nGravity itself is an acceleration; gravitational force acts as a force.\nNewton’s Laws of Motion\n\nFirst Law: An object remains at rest or in constant motion unless acted upon by a force.\nSecond Law: force equals mass times acceleration F = ma; rate of momentum change.\nThird Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, acting on different objects.\n\n\nElasticity and Hooke’s Law\n\nElastic materials return to original shape after force removal; F = kΔx, where k is the spring constant.\nLimit of Proportionality: Force-extension proportionality limit.\nElastic Limit: Beyond which material does not return to its original shape.\n\n\nCircular Motion\n\nConstant change in direction, hence changing velocity even at constant speed.\nCentripetal force directed toward the circle’s center;

Overview\nIntroductory Context\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) play a pivotal role in regulating Earth’s thermal equilibrium, enabling habitable conditions by retaining solar energy. While their natural presence sustains global temperatures, anthropogenic amplification has precipitated accelerated climatic shifts, including global warming and erratic weather phenomena.\n\nAtmospheric Composition\nEarth’s atmosphere comprises nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and argon (0.93%), with trace constituents such as carbon dioxide (0.04%), methane (0.00017%), and nitrous oxide (0.00003%). These GHGs, though minor in concentration, exert disproportionate influence on radiative forcing. Water vapor, a transient GHG, fluctuates regionally but contributes significantly to thermal retention.\nBullet Points\n\n\nDominant atmospheric gases: Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.93%).\n\n\nCritical GHGs: CO₂ (0.04%), CH₄ (0.00017%), N₂O (0.00003%).\n\n\nWater vapor: Variable concentration, potent thermal insulator.\n\n\n\nGreenhouse Gas Prevalence and Trends\nPre-industrial CO₂ levels hovered near 280 ppm, surging to 420 ppm due to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Methane concentrations have doubled since 1750, driven by agricultural practices and hydrocarbon extraction. Nitrous oxide, rising steadily, stems from industrial fertilizers and biomass burning. These trends, corroborated by ice-core data and satellite observations, underscore anthropogenic dominance in modern GHG escalation.\nBullet Points\n\n\nCO₂: 280 ppm (pre-industrial) → 420 ppm (current).\n\n\nCH₄: 700 ppb (1750) → 1,900 ppb (present).\n\n\nPrimary drivers: Fossil fuels, agriculture, land-use changes.\n\n\n\nSolar Radiation and Wave Interaction\nThe Sun emits shortwave radiation (visible light, UV), which penetrates the atmosphere to warm Earth’s surface. Re-emitted as longwave infrared (IR) radiation, this energy is partially absorbed by GHGs. Molecular vibrations in CO₂ and CH₄ resonate at IR frequencies, trapping heat through photon re-emission—a process termed thermal entrapment.\nBullet Points\n\n\nSolar emission: Shortwave (visible/UV).\n\n\nEarth’s re-emission: Longwave IR.\n\n\nGHG interaction: IR absorption → molecular excitation → heat retention.\n\n\n\nImpacts on Earth’s Climate\nThermal entrapment elevates surface temperatures, altering atmospheric circulation and oceanic currents.

This differential transmittance creates an energy imbalance, elevating tropospheric temperatures. Without this effect, Earth’s average temperature would plummet to -18°C, rendering the planet inhospitable.\nBullet Points\n\n\nEnergy imbalance: More incoming than outgoing radiation.\n\n\nTemperature differential: Current avg. 15°C vs. -18°C (GHG-free scenario).\n\n\nCritical outcome: Sustained warmth enabling biospheric viability.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAnthropogenic amplification of GHGs has intensified the natural greenhouse effect, driving unprecedented climatic volatility.

While naturally occurring, anthropogenic activities have amplified their concentrations, exacerbating global warming and climatic instability. Understanding their interaction with electromagnetic radiation elucidates the mechanisms driving planetary heating.\nComposition of Earth’s Atmosphere\nEarth’s atmosphere comprises predominantly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with argon (0.93%) and trace gases forming the remainder. Greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (CO₂, ~0.04%), methane (CH₄, ~0.00018%), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and water vapor—constitute a minor fraction but exert disproportionate influence. Water vapor, though variable, contributes significantly to the natural greenhouse effect. Industrialization has elevated CO₂ levels by over 50% since pre-industrial times, intensifying radiative forcing.\nBullet Summary\n\n\nDominant atmospheric gases: Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.93%).\n\n\nKey greenhouse gases: CO₂ (0.04%), CH₄ (0.00018%), N₂O, water vapor.\n\n\nHuman activities have increased CO₂ by &gt;50% since the 18th century.\n\n\nPresence and Trends of Greenhouse Gases\nCurrent atmospheric CO₂ levels exceed 420 ppm, a stark rise from ~280 ppm pre-1750. Methane concentrations have surged by 150% due to agriculture and fossil fuel extraction. Nitrous oxide, primarily from fertilizers, has risen by 23%. These escalations correlate with industrial expansion, deforestation, and intensive farming, driving unprecedented radiative imbalance.\nBullet Summary\n\n\nCO₂: &gt;420 ppm today vs. 280 ppm pre-industrialization.\n\n\nMethane: 150% increase since 1750.\n\n\nN₂O: 23% rise linked to synthetic fertilizers.\n\n\nSolar Radiation and Wave Interactions\nThe Sun emits ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) radiation. Shorter-wavelength UV and visible light penetrate the atmosphere, heating Earth’s surface. The planet re-emits energy as longer-wavelength IR. Greenhouse gases absorb and re-radiate this IR, with molecular vibrations in CO₂ and CH₄ resonating at IR frequencies, trapping heat.\nBullet Summary\n\n\nSolar emissions: UV, visible, IR waves.\n\n\nEarth re-emits longer IR waves.\n\n\nGreenhouse gases absorb IR via molecular resonance.\n\n\nImpact on Earth’s Surface and Climate\nTrapped IR elevates surface temperatures, analogous to a thermal blanket. This process drives global warming, glacial melt, sea-level rise, and extreme weather. Enhanced greenhouse effects disrupt ecosystems, amplify heatwaves, and alter precipitation patterns, underscoring the urgency of emission mitigation.\nBullet Summary\n\n\nIR retention raises global temperatures.\n\n\nConsequences: Glacial retreat, sea-level rise, extreme weather events.\n\n\nWhy the Atmosphere Warms\nGreenhouse gases act as radiative sentinels, permitting solar ingress but impeding IR egress. This differential transmittance creates a net energy gain, elevating atmospheric thermal inertia. Without this effect, Earth’s average temperature would plummet to -18°C, rendering it inhospitable. Human-induced amplification, however, risks destabilizing this delicate balance.\nBullet Summary\n\n\nMechanism: Allow solar entry but block IR exit.\n\n\nNatural greenhouse effect sustains ~15°C global average.\n\n\nAnthropogenic intensification risks climatic tipping points.\n\n\n\nThis structured analysis, blending expository prose with succinct summaries, caters to advanced curricula while fostering conceptual clarity.

Instead, the energy is used to overcome the intermolecular bonds, allowing particles to break free from their fixed positions, the intermolecular forces are overcome. This is a phase transition, where solid and liquid both exist and it is trying to turn into a liquid with more freedom of movement. At this point is the temperature where the energy is used to break the intermolecular forces instead of raising the speed of the particles.\nWhen all the intermolecular forces are weakened, the particles are still close together but with no regular pattern of arrangement, they can now slide with each other and they are now a liquid. In a liquid, they can flow around with each other with no definite shape but still a definite volume, they take the shape of their container.\nThe energy added can now continue to increase the average kinetic energy of the particles, raising the temperature, making the particles moving faster.\nThen it plateaus again, this time it is trying to break the remaining intermolecular forces, this is the boiling point, where it tries to turn from a liquid into a gas. The particles are escaping the liquid as a randomly moving, high speed particle, gas particles.\nWhen they have broken free from the forces holding them together, the gas molecules are now far apart from each other, with negligible intermolecular forces. A gas does not have a definite volume nor shape and will expand to fill its container.\nContinuing to add energy to the gas will make the particles average kinetic energy higher, making them move faster.

up internal energy\n\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules\n\nTherefore, only an increase in the average kinetic energy of the molecules will result in an increase in temperature of the substance\nDue to thermal expansion, when the temperature of a substance increases, the potential energy of the molecules also increases\n\n\n\nWhen only the potential energy of the molecules changes, the temperature of the substance does not change\n\nThis is the case for all state changes (e.g. melting, boiling)\n\n\n"},"02_areas/PHYSICS/2/attachments/attachments":{"title":"attachments","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"attachments"},"02_areas/PHYSICS/2/evaporation":{"title":"evaporation","links":["02_areas/PHYSICS/2/Cooling-Effect-of-Evaporation"],"tags":[],"content":"Cooling

circuit\n\nResistors\n\nPotential dividers, fixed and variable resistors, thermistors and light-dependent resistors (LDRs) are all used to control current\n\nMeters\n\n\nAmmeters and voltmeters are used to measure the current and potential difference\n\nAmmeters are always connected in series whilst voltmeters are always connected in parallel\n\n\n\nSwitches and functional components\n\n\nSwitches open and close a circuit and determine whether current can flow\n\n\nFunctional components perform specific roles when current passes through them:\n\n\nMotors rotate\n\n\nLamps emit light\n\n\nHeaters transfer thermal energy\n\n\nBells emit a sound\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic components\n\n\nMagnetising coils, relays and transformers use electromagnetic

difference\n\n\n\n\nFuses\n\nProtect expensive components from current surges and act as a safety measure against fire\n\nThermistors\n\n\nA thermistor is a non-ohmic conductor and a temperature-dependent resistor\n\n\nThe resistance of a thermistor changes depending on its temperature\n\nAs the temperature increases the resistance of a thermistor decreases and vice

falling onto it (illumination)\n\n\nAs the light intensity increases, the resistance of an LDR decreases\n\n\n\n\n\nDiodes\n\n\nDiodes are occasionally drawn with a horizontal line running through the middle of them\n\n\nDiodes only allow current to flow through them in one direction (see the diagram below)\n\nThis is the direction that the triangle points in the diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen travelling in the same direction as the diode, current can flow. If the diode is flipped, it now prevents current from flowing in the circuit\n\n\nLight emitting diodes (LEDs) behave the exact same way, but they emit light when current flows through them\n\n\nCurrent in Circuits\nA series circuit contains a single complete loop\n\n\nIn a series circuit, the current is the same value at any point\n\nThis is because the number of electrons per second that passes through one part of the circuit is the same number that passes through any other part\n\n\n\nThis means that all components in a closed-loop have the same current\n\n\n\n\nA parallel circuit consists of multiple loops containing circuit components\nWhat is the rule for current in a parallel circuit?\n\n\nIn a parallel circuit, the current splits along each branch at a junction\n\nSome of it goes down one branch and the rest goes down the other\n\n\n\nThis means that the current from the source is larger than the current in each branch\n\n\nLighting circuits\n\n\nA lighting circuit is used to supply power to multiple light sources\n\nOffice lights are a common example, as multiple identical bulbs must have the same brightness\n\n\n\nLighting circuits are constructed in parallel because:\n\n\nBulb’s all have the same potential difference and therefore the same brightness\n\n\nIf one bulb breaks, the rest continue to function as current passes along each branch independently\n\n\nThis also means lamps can be switched off and on individually without breaking the whole circuit\nThe current before a junction is equal to the sum of currents along each branch after the junction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a junction in a parallel circuit (where two or more wires meet) the current is conserved\n\nThis means the amount of current flowing into the junction is equal to the amount of current flowing out of it\n\n\n\nThis is because charge is conserved\n\n\nNote that the current does not always split equally – often there will be more current in some branches than in others\n\nThe current in each branch will only be identical if the resistance of the components along each branch are identical\n\n\n\nCurrent behaves in this way because it is the flow of electrons:\n\n\nElectrons are physical matter – they cannot be created or destroyed\n\n\nThis means the total number of electrons (and hence current) going around a circuit must remain the same\n\n\nWhen the electrons reach a junction, however, some of them will go one way and the rest will go the other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResistors in series &amp; parallel\n\n\nWhen two or more components are connected in series:\n\nThe combined resistance of the components is equal to the sum of individual resistances\n\n\n\n\nWhen resistors are connected in parallel, the combined resistance is less than the resistance of any of the individual components\n\n\nIf two resistors of equal resistance are connected in parallel, then the combined resistance will halve\n\n\nTo determine the combined resistance of any combination of two resistors, you must use the equation:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n is the combined resistance in ohms, Ω\n\n\n is the resistance of resistor 1 in ohms, Ω\n\n\n is the resistance of resistor 2 in ohms, Ω\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Current":{"title":"Current","links":["02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Charges","02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Electrical-Conductors-and-Insulators","02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Potential-Difference","02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Electric-Fields","02_areas/PHYSICS/4/Circuit-Components"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Electric Current \n                  \n                \n\nThe flow of electric charge (typically electrons) through a conductor.

In 2023, I started using AI-based tools in my development workflow. Initially, I was super impressed with the capabilities of these LLMs. The fact that I could just copy and paste obscure compiler errors along with the C++ source code, and be told where the error is caused felt like magic.\nOnce GitHub Copilot started becoming more and more powerful, I started using it more and more. I used various other LLM integrations right in my editor. Using AI was part of my workflow.\nIn late 2024 I removed all LLM integrations from my code editors. I still use LLMs occasionally and I do think AI can be used in a way that is very beneficial for many programmers. So then why don’t I use AI-powered code editing tools?\nTesla FSD\nFrom 2019 to 2021 I drove a Tesla. Though I would never make the same purchase again, not for political reasons, just because the cars are quite low quality, very overpriced and a hell to repair or maintain.\nWhen I got my Tesla, I started using the Full Self-Driving (FSD) anytime I could. It felt great to just put the car on FSD on the highway and zone out a bit. Switching lanes was as simple as hitting the turn signal, and the car would switch lanes. Driving for me was just getting to the highway, turning on FSD, telling the car to switch lanes every now and then, and listen to music/podcasts while zoning out.\nIf you drive a car often, you’ll know that when you’re driving on the highway, everything sort of happens automatically. Keeping your car in the lane at the right speed becomes a passive action, it does not require the type of focus that for example reading a book requires, it’s the type of focus that walking requires, it happens in the background of your mind.\nIn the period from 2019 to 2021 I exclusively drove my Tesla for longer rides. After 2021, I went back to driving regular cars and making this switch was definitely not what I expected. Driving on the highway required my full attention for the first month or so, I had to re-learn keeping the car in the middle of the lane without thinking about it.\nBeing reliant on Tesla’s FSD took away my own ability to go into autopilot.\nMy experience with AI code editors\nWorking with AI-powered code editors was somewhat similar. Initially, I felt that I completed work a lot faster when assisted by AI. The work I was doing most of the time was not super complex, and AI felt like putting my Tesla on FSD, I could just guide the machine to do my work for me.\nIn my free time, I started working on a side project on my personal account on my work device. On this account, I did not have access to Copilot and my other cool, fancy AI tools. This is when using AI started to feel very similar to my Tesla FSD story.\nI felt less competent at doing what was quite basic software development than a year or so before. All of a sudden, it made it very clear to me how reliant I had become on AI tools. Anytime I defined a function, I paused in my editor to wait until the AI tools would write the implementation for me. It took some effort to remember what the syntax was to write unit tests by hand.\nWith my work, AI started to become less useful over time as well. Not only did it take out the fun for me, but I started to feel a bit insecure about making some implementation decisions myself. Outsourcing the decisions to the AI seemed a lot easier. But sometimes, the AI couldn’t figure things out, even with the best prompts. It was quite clear that because I did not practice the basics often, I was less capable with the harder parts as well.\nThe loss of Fingerspitzengefühl\nFingerspitzengefühl [ˈfɪŋɐˌʃpɪtsənɡəˌfyːl] is a German term, literally meaning “finger tips feeling” and meaning intuitive flair or instinct, which has been adopted by the English language as a loanword. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond most appropriately and tactfully. 1\nDefining seniority is a very tough thing. Though in my opinion a lot of being a “senior” is in soft-skills, when it comes to the technical hard-skills, a lot comes down to Fingerspitzengefühl. The longer you work with a language, framework or codebase, the more you develop this kind of intuition of what the correct approach is. The gut feeling of “something feels off” slowly turns into a feeling of “this is what we should do”.\nThis developed intuition is not just on an architectural level. A big component is in the lower level details, when to use pointers (or what type of pointers), whether to use asserts or checks, what to pick from the standard library when multiple options are available (though senior C++ programmers still can’t seem to agree on this).\nThis intuition is what I was slowly losing when relying on AI tools a lot. And this is coming from a lead developer. When I see a lot of hype about vibe coding, I can’t help but think: how do you exactly expect to vibe code your way to senior? Where will you get the skills from to maintain and extend the vibe-coded codebase when the AI tools are down, or have become too expensive?\nEven with larger context windows, more computing power, reasoning models or agents, there will be things that AI won’t be able to do. Over time, the AI tools will be more and more powerful, sure. But when you receive a Slack message that “the website works fine, but the app is down in production; I tried it locally and there it works fine, nothing in Sentry either”, good luck getting an AI agent to fix this for you. Maybe it can, maybe it can’t. And when an AI agent can’t figure it out, will your reply be “sorry, Cursor doesn’t get it, will prompt more tomorrow”?\nYou can get by without these tools\nSometimes it feels like you have to use AI or be out of a job in 6 months. We’ve been hearing the “3-6 months from now”-story for over two years at this point. I stopped trusting CEO promises about functionality “3-6 months from now” years ago. When I got my Tesla in 2019, I paid €6400 for functionality that was supposed to arrive in “3-6 months from now”, and the functionality is still not present the way it was promised over 5 years ago.\nRight now, it is unlikely that letting AI do your coding will work for projects larger than a university project. When working on legacy systems or larger projects in enterprises or when you need to work with and consult a lot of dependency internals (like I do with Unreal Engine), AI tools will often not be able to make things work. When you need to work with internal DSLs, tools or frameworks, good luck getting LLMs to generate useful output. For some industries, you can’t even use AI tools at all for a multitude of reasons.\nFor some things you really should not want to rely on AI. When implementing authentication systems like JWT2 signing or RBAC3, adding “and it should be secure” to the prompt won’t make it secure if it’s been trained on GitHub code that had CVEs4. When it comes to security, you should be the person who is responsible and understands this fully. Critical systems should be written and reviewed by humans, if we are heading to a situation where one AI agent writes the code, another reviews the autogenerated PR and then another AI agent deploys the code, we will see a huge spike of security issues soon.\nWhere I draw the line\nI still use AI, sometimes. I think it can be a great tool, when used wisely. I draw the line at integration. I keep AI fully separate from my code editor. All of the context, I add manually. I intentionally keep the effort required quite high, so it disincentivizes me.\nExamples where I use AI for work include “convert these Go tests in structs to tests in a map”, “convert this calculation to SIMD”, or “when the content type is application/zlib, decode the body”5. I have set up some custom instructions to only give me the code that has changed, and give me instructions for adding it. This way, I am still the one making the changes in the codebase. Just approving a Git diff is not enough, I want to manually add the code myself, only then do I feel confident to sign off on it and take responsibility for it.\nAnother great use case for AI is learning. I often have questions that are quite uncommon, as I have a few very niche interests. Turns out, adding netcode to a custom game engine using ECS doesn’t have a lot of learning resources. What has worked for me, is asking AI to explain pieces of code, like “explain this assembly code”, “explain what this shader does”, “which books go in-depth about resolving client/server desyncs in game engines”. The AI seems to struggle with these sometimes, I’m getting mixed results, but the results are still much better than search engines. I will even use it for this article, though not for writing content, but for checking6.\nAnother benefit of using AI this way is the cost. No unnecessary API calls, manually managed contexts and more control over the LLM settings. I use a desktop application with a bunch of different LLMs hooked up to it. I have used it daily for the last 3 months or so, and in total, I have consumed around $4 in credits.\nI do want to add that with some things I am more strict. On my personal website, I don’t want any AI-generated content, whether that’s text or images. I don’t like AI generated images or ‘art’ personally for various reasons and I think AI-generated text lacks character, it feels very flat and boring. When something is created by humans, it to me has more value than when it’s created by AI.\nDoing what you love\nIt is also worth noting that there are more things to think about than efficiency and productivity. It’s also about doing what you love. If you love coding, keep doing it yourself, even if a computer might be better at it.\nIn 1997, Deep Blue won the chess match against the then world chess champion Garry Kasparov7, yet people still play chess. When it comes to programming, I’d say that I program for the same reason that people still play chess8. Though chess and software development are very different, with chess being much more limited in scope, I think it is good to keep in mind that sometimes, we can do things just to enjoy them.\nMy advice to new programmers\nDon’t become a forever junior who lets AI do all their work. If you want to become a programmer, learn to program yourself. Be curious, put in the time and effort to learn how things really work, and how things work in the layer below that. It really pays off. Learning how everything works under the hood and using that is amazing, just keep learning, don’t be a prompt engineer (if you can even call that engineering). Believe me, it’s more fun to be competent9.\nEven though AI might be smarter than you, never blindly trust the AI output. Don’t build your whole workflow around it. Sometimes try to work without it for a few days. The better at programming you are, the more AI will get in your way for the more complex work.\nIf you learn to code now, keep building your skills instead of letting AI do all the heavy lifting, you’ll be capable of fixing the messes that vibe coding is now creating. I don’t want to sound elitist, but if you don’t want to learn to go beyond vibe coding, maybe coding isn’t for you. Because positions where all work can be done by vibe coding are the ones that will be eliminated first when AI becomes more powerful.\nAnd remember: if you cannot code without AI, you cannot code.\nConclusion\nWhen you are using AI, you are sacrificing knowledge for speed. Sometimes it’s worth making this trade-off. Though it is important to remember that even the best athletes in the world are still doing their basic drills for a reason. The same applies to software development: you need to practice the basics, to be able to do the advanced work. You need to keep your axe sharp.\nWe are still a long way out from AI taking over our jobs. A lot of companies are creating FOMO10 as a sales tactic to get more customers, to show traction to their investors, to get another round of funding, to generate the next model that will definitely revolutionize everything.\nAI is a tool, it is not good or bad in itself, it’s what you do with it. I do think it can be a great tool, as long as you are not reliant on it for your workflow. Make sure you can still work effectively without it, make sure you don’t push code to production that you don’t fully understand and don’t think of AI as a replacement for your own thinking. Stay curious, keep learning.\n\nSource: Wikipedia ↩︎\nJSON Web Tokens, or JWTs are a common way to generate authentication tokens, among other uses ↩︎\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is a mechanism to restrict system access by setting permissions and privileges ↩︎\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a program used to identify, define and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cve.org ↩︎\nThe specific contents here don’t matter that much, they are just examples of what I use AI for ↩︎\nThe prompt I’ve used for this article: “I want you to proofread an article I have written.

It argues that with minimal CSS (specifically, seven declarations), websites can be significantly improved for readability, while retaining their core benefits like being lightweight, responsive, and accessible. The author encourages web designers to make simple adjustments to line-height, contrast, font size, and line-width to enhance user experience, emphasizing that default styles are often ‘ugly’ and hinder readability.\nKey Points\n\nMinimal Effort for Improvement: It takes very few CSS declarations (e.g., 7) to drastically improve a website’s readability.\nRetains Core Benefits: Improved sites can still be lightweight, fast, responsive, cross-browser compatible, and accessible.\nKey Readability Improvements:\n\nLine-height: Use a minimum of 1.4 for body copy; headings should be tighter.\nSpacing/Padding: Ensure text doesn’t hit the side of the browser; provide breathing room.\nContrast: Tone down harsh black-on-white contrast (e.g., use #EEEEEE for background).\nFont Size: Body copy should be 16px or larger for screen readability.\nLine-width: Keep lines to 60-80 characters for easier reading, avoiding overly long lines.\n\n\nSatirical Tone: The piece is explicitly satirical, using strong language to make its points about the simplicity of good web design principles.\n\n\nbettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/\nOriginal Content\nSeriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.\n7 fucking declarations.\nThat’s how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It’s so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:\n\nShit’s still lightweight and loads fast\nStill fits on all your shitty screens\nStill looks the same in all your shitty browsers\nThe motherfucker’s still accessible to every asshole that visits your site\nShit’s still legible and gets your fucking point across\n\nAnd guess what, motherfucker:\nYou never knew it, but it’s easy to improve readability on your site. Here’s how.\nLet it breathe\nLook at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you’re building. Assuming they’re not married they probably shouldn’t be humping. The defaults are trash — pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can’t see that…piss off.\nIf your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.\nA little less contrast\nBlack on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would’ve even made this site’s background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn’t so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.\nSize Matters\nI know your partner says otherwise, but it’s true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.\nLine-width, motherfucker\nLooking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don’t make me read a line of text that’s 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.\nYes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck\nI love what the creator of this site’s inspiration did. What I’m saying is that it’s so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they’re also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.\n\n“You’re a fucking moron if you use default browser styles.”\n- Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n\nEpilogue\nInspired by the geniuses behind motherfuckingwebsite.com and txti.\nThis page—that isn’t a total fucking eyesore—was created by me with help from him."},"03_resources/Better-Motherfucking-Website":{"title":"Better Motherfucking Website","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Better Motherfucking Website\nURL: bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/\nThe key points are: simple CSS, readability, accessibility, and practical web design advice.\nThe “Better Motherfucking Website” page delivers blunt, satirical advice on web design, emphasizing that making a website readable and accessible is easy and requires minimal CSS.

For Vercel Ship 2025, we wanted that experience to feel fluid and fast.\nThis is a look at how we made the conference platform and visuals, from ferrofluid-inspired 3D visuals and generative AI workflows, to modular component systems and more.\nVercel Ship 2024 ‘s visual direction was magnetic particles. Then, we launched Fluid compute and brought motion to the particles. For Ship 2025, we wanted to push things even further.\nWe explored ferrofluid, a black magnetic liquid developed by NASA. It felt like the right intersection of motion, magnetism, and something complex under the surface (but simple above).\n\nA fluid visual identity that subtly nods to our past while pushing into something new.\nGenerative AI helped us rapidly prototyped ideas and test visual directions.\nWe bounced between Cinema4D, Figma, and Flux to kickstart the visual identity, spinning up quick mocks that shaped the foundation of this year’s brand.\nWhen we first explored ferrofluid, its structured elegance and responsiveness felt like a perfect fit. But during internal reviews, we found a major issue. The visuals were triggering symptoms of trypophobia, an aversion to clustered bumps or holes. So we decided to pivot.\nWe explored full-spectrum color, oil-slick vibes, and even a callback to our prism from a previous Next.js Conf. But the visuals started to drift. Too far, too shiny, and too loud.\nSo we pulled back. We had already trained a model to output consistent lighting, form, and material. That gave us a stable base to evolve without starting over. We softened the shapes and removed the spikes. What we landed on was darker, sleeker, and more suitable. A near-metallic liquid system. Reflective and grounded.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nIn total, we generated over 15,000 images and videos during the design exploration using tools like Flux, Google Veo 2, Runway, and Ideogram. There was no waiting around for “perfect.” Instead, we embraced the momentum, shared in-progress work early, and built on top of each other’s thinking.\nFor the site and registration flow, we turned to v0, which helps you quickly create your ideas through simple text prompts. Once the core structure and functionality were mapped in Figma, it made sense to move straight into code.\nWe prompted key parts of the registration, schedule, and gallery interactions directly in v0, aligning to our design system. Because we shipped live prototypes on day one, we could share, gather feedback, and iterate rapidly.\nHaving this kind of prototyping capability within the Design team was a huge unlock. It saved time and made handoff more efficient. Design Engineering started from real components, not mockups. By the time the they stepped in, the structure, layout, and interactions were already set and ready for their final sprinkle of magic.\nWhile the concept was being shaped, we started experimenting on how users would interact with it on the site. One thing was clear: we wanted some type of fluid.\nWe began by translating some of the AI concepts into code, aiming to capture the same sense of motion and lighting. We used a ray-marching rendering technique to create a smooth surface without any visible polygons.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/depth\nWe also experimented with a glass prism. Since we were using ray-marching, we could simulate how light bends through transparent materials.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/liquid\nOnce we had the shape and rendering process in place, we began layering in interactions.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/ferro-pyramid\nWe explored simulating ferrofluid by displacing a subdivided mesh.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/ferro-mesh-2\nThis created the effect of fluid particles acting as magnetic fields, pushing the mesh outward.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/ferro-mesh\nThat version didn’t quite feel right, so we shifted to simulating more realistic fluids using ray-marching. In one version, two simulations ran in parallel, one for the floor and another for the tetrahedron.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/water-2\nHow does this work? The fluid simulation is calculated in one shader, then passed as input into a ray-marching scene. In this setup, the simulation runs on the large plane, while a smaller plane acts as a “ray-marching portal.”\nThis means the liquid isn’t made from triangles. Instead, we simulate a light ray shooting from the camera through the portal and into the surface.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nAfter that, we added shading and made the simulation collide with a solid prism at the center.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nTry the demo → ship-25-explorations.vercel.app/water-triangle\nOnce we adjusted the lighting and interaction, we had our hero.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nConference sites can be deceptively complex. Content needs to be editable on-demand, without deployments. Registration data needs to be queryable. Everything needs to feel fast.\nIn past years, we supported those needs with a mix of external tools and internal caching layers. It got the job done, but maintaining that balance became increasingly difficult.\nTo reduce latency, we first tried introducing as a fast, supplementary data layer. It helped with performance in key areas, but introduced new challenges. Duplicated data, extra update steps, limited querying, and a reliance on engineering for edits to high-priority information like promo codes or workshop capacity.\nThis year, we stepped back and simplified. We built the site as a Next.js app, backed by a , and powered by Payload as the CMS. With full ownership over the API and database, we could shape the system around how we actually work.\nPreviously, content lived in one place, registrant data in another, and engineering had their own models. Payload let us unify those concerns into a single source of truth:\n\nA CMS for editable landing-page content\nA searchable, real-time database of registrants\nA backend that engineering could build against directly, without sync logic or duplicated models\n\nThe result was a system where teams could move independently. The Events team could manage capacity, content, and promo codes without engineering involvement. Developers could optimize for performance without waiting on upstream APIs.\nThis stack gave us more control, but we still had to be deliberate about speed. We used Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for CMS-driven pages, with on-demand cache invalidation tied to updates. Partial Prerendering (PPR) let us generate most of the homepage at build time, while keeping elements like CTAs and login states dynamic.\nWe used the use cache directive and cacheLife to tune freshness by content type. For example, we kept ticket availability up to date with a short cache lifetime, while allowing lower-churn content to stay cached longer. after() handled post-checkout logic like sending confirmation emails and logging registrations without holding up the user flow.\nThe Payload admin panel lives on the same domain as the Vercel and the Ship site, which made debugging and logging more streamlined. Sign In with Vercel gives us secure, account-based access without additional setup. Our backend lives in the monorepo, so we could use shared UI assets, like logos or design tokens, directly in the CMS.\nThis kept the experience consistent, simplified setup, and made collaboration easier across teams.\nTo support multiple events each year, we built a library of reusable, themeable components using shadcn, Geist, and cva. This gave us the flexibility to iterate quickly without sacrificing consistency across properties.\nFor transactional emails, we used React Email and plugged it directly into our CMS. Marketing could preview and edit content live, with no engineering lift.\nThese shared systems made it easier for Brand, Engineering, and Marketing to collaborate across surfaces, and helped us move faster while keeping everything on-brand\nManaging our own database gave us flexibility, but surfaced some limitations in our local tooling. Standing up Postgres locally, running migrations, and seeding data added overhead when working on UI changes or prototyping features. Seed scripts helped, but the local developer experience isn’t where it needs to be.\nWe’re now focusing on automating more of that setup. Previewing real data in local environments, simplifying schema updates, and improving workflows for dynamic content like Open Graph generation and campaign previews.\nOn the frontend, we’re continuing to explore how to deliver more visual detail without sacrificing speed or performance. Tools like Motion and Three.js helped us push this year’s visuals forward.\nWe wanted the site to move as smoothly as it looked. One standout moment was the What you can expect section, built using useTransform from Motion for React. Sticky containers and full-screen sections gave us control over scroll behavior, including a custom zoom effect that took a bit of fun math to get right. v0 helped us prototype the logic quickly and dial in the feel.\nAnother subtle touch was the sticky header. To make sure it adapted across light and dark sections, we tested several options, including clip-paths. We eventually landed on a much simpler solution using mix-blend-mode.\n\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we’ve been building, how we’re thinking, and cast a vision of where we’re going next.\nThe registration page was just the start. It brought Brand, Engineering, and Marketing together in a way that felt fast, fluid, and collaborative from day one.\nWe prototyped in code, explored quickly, made a few pivots, and pushed the system forward along the way. Not everything went as expected, but it came together into something we’re proud of.\nAnd we’re just getting started. The full experience is on the way.

She argued that AI systems are not just ‘models + data’ but fundamentally ‘models + data + humans,’ emphasizing the often-overlooked human element. Dr. Russakovsky highlighted pervasive social biases in computer vision datasets (e.g., facial recognition, gender stereotypes, geographic disparities) and their propagation into AI models. She discussed mitigation strategies, including data examination, representative data collection, and algorithmic interventions, while acknowledging their limitations. The talk underscored the critical need for diverse backgrounds and perspectives among AI developers and leaders to address bias and ensure responsible AI development.\nKey Points\n\nAI System Components: AI is fundamentally models + data + humans, with the human element being crucial but often overlooked.\nSocial Bias in Computer Vision: AI models exhibit biases (e.g., facial recognition accuracy disparities, gender stereotypes in activities like cooking, geographic representation imbalances) due to skewed training data.\nData Set Examples:\n\nGender Shades Study: Commercial facial recognition systems perform poorly on women with darker skin (13-14% error) compared to men with lighter skin (&lt;1% error), linked to data sets having 80-90% lighter-skinned faces.\nImageNet: Skewed gender distribution (more male-coded images), age bias (more 18-40 adults), and cultural bias (e.g., “groom” depicted as Western heteronormative).\nCOCO: Gendered associations with scenes (e.g., men in outdoor sports, women in shopping/dining) and stylized depictions of co-occurrences (e.g., women with flowers vs. men with flowers).\nGeographic Bias: Standard datasets heavily concentrated in the US, leading to models failing to recognize common objects (like bar soap) from other regions.\n\n\nMitigation Strategies:\n\nKnow Your Data: Thoroughly examine dataset contents.\nCollect Representative Data: Crucial but difficult and expensive.\nAlgorithmic Interventions: Methods like reweighting or using generated data can help but have limitations and can introduce new biases.\n\n\nBias Propagation: Bias can propagate when AI models are powerful enough to capture data patterns fully and when data bias is salient to the model’s task.\nImportance of Human Perspective: Bias originates from human history and prejudice, propagating through data, models, and AI decision-making. Diverse AI researchers and leaders are essential to identify and address these biases, as lived experiences inform the questions asked during development (e.g., Joy Buolamwini’s facial recognition work, speaker’s experience with voice recognition).\nAI for All: A non-profit dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion in AI, aiming to educate a diverse next generation of AI leaders.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/n8wMHnSFHQdeGrGOtblVtbHffjrEw1p1TpoPw0zqW-7TLUMx4tb5baEG1hm_BdjNCiMF_RtOE88okZXn.VkTmneInfI0siEfF%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FL_IX0xv5TEpPsBRe9jgaxfuZw4ic9hnHepve1arrNc56OPmQTAN8zE4irqz-PqKd.TGoKfC-xIt4Cmsno\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\nOh my god!

So everybody welcome associate Professor Olga Rosakovsky.\n00:01:20\nOh, goodness.\nHello, everybody! It is! I love the idea of like everybody posting high ends in in chat that was awesome, that I’ve I’ve given so many zoom talks. I’ve never had that happen. And this is just beautiful. And now I’m going to make all of my students do it. Now, anytime. We’re hosting, you know, a virtual speaker. I’m gonna make everybody do this. This is just really really lovely.\nchat. I’m really, really excited to be here. I brought stuff for show and tell. So, showing Miriam in Brooklyn ahead of time. So this is the 1st year of Stanford AI. For all signed by all the students. So this is a photograph that still sort of lives in my office. This is it was the 1st year that we did this, and sort of had 24 High school girls come to Stanford and\nhang out with us in the AI lab and learn about AI, and then this is so back in the day the program was called sailors. So this is why this little is like a little stress ball. Robot. I don’t think they make them anymore. We used to print them, for, like every year of\nof the programs. We would like print a new one. But I don’t think these are being made anymore, which is really unfortunate, because it’s very cute, and then it says, Sailors, which was the Stanford AI. Lab Outreach Summer program, which is what it was originally called. So I still have these in my office, and I am just absolutely delighted. The program is still going. And I’m just, you know, here to make this experience\ngood and happy and educational and enriching for you all. So I will start sharing slides and dive in. But please feel free to\npause me like please feel free to go off on tangents. If there’s something that’s like on your mind that you’ve always wanted to ask somebody like, Please feel free to ask, and if we don’t get through the whole talk, that’s totally fine, and if we you know, get through it all, and then have more time for questions. That’s also fine. So so, however, this goes is great. I probably won’t be able to see chat, but I will be able to see, I think, hand rate.\nhands raised because I will. I do see some of the videos. And so I think if you raise your hand it’ll pop you up to the top. And so I think I will see that or feel free to just unmute and jump in.\nAlso totally fine.\nOkay, so\nI’m going to dive in. So what I wanted to talk about today again, unless we get distracted, is talking about fairness and visual recognition. In particular, the importance of the human perspective and computer vision. So I am a computer vision researcher, I run a research lab, it’s called the Visual AI lab,\nyou can, you know, find us online learn a bit more about what we do. But of course, the sort of most important part of any lab, or the people who work in it. So this is a photo taken now a couple of years ago. So most people are still around, but not everybody. And then we’ve got new members. But this is us sort of sitting around a table at a dinner. And what we’re trying to build is computer vision systems. So sort of AI systems that can\nunderstand different parts of this image, for example. So be able to say that there’s a fireplace, and like there’s a box of Legos, because, of course, I’m holding a box of Legos. Why wouldn’t I be? There is some glasses in the foreground, right? So solving object recognition problems building AI systems that can do. Scene understanding so sort of figure out that this is a dining scene that we’re all sitting around the table, that there’s a person wearing the glasses.\nbeing able to do action, detection. So on images or on videos. These are people who are sitting and smiling and maybe posing for a photograph. So, what are the people doing, being able to do vision and language? So, for example, being able to describe this photo in natural language, or even perhaps being able to do image generation. So sort of go the other way is given a natural language description, being able to generate an image.\nso I will. By the way, I should probably ask, how far are you into the program? Like, what what can I assume? Are you like\nthis? The 1st week? Is this the last week, like, where, where are you at.\n00:05:36\nAbout halfway through.\n00:05:38\nAbout halfway through. Okay, okay, a good sense of that. All right. So\nAnd so when it comes to trustworthy, we might think of things like capable or robust, that when it comes to trusted, we might think of things like transparent or responsible, and then sort of at the intersection is, we would think about things like thoroughly evaluated or thoroughly understood. And so a lot of the type of work that we do is\nlike really trying to get to the heart of like, what makes these systems thing like? Sort of why do they work the way that they work? And what about what about the sort of components of the computer vision system are actually important.\nAnd so if we think about sort of building an AI system. And here I’m sort of assuming AI is equal or approximately equal to machine learning. I know you all have talked about sort of what does AI mean, and what is sort of the basics of machine learning. How does AI relate to machine learning? We can have these debates. And I’ve had many of these debates about sort of is AI bigger than machine learning is machine learning bigger than AI are. They sort of is one a subset of the other. I think everybody has different opinions. So I’m happy to\nhave that debate with you also. But if we just sort of simplify them, and then think of it in the context of AI being sort of approximately equivalent to machine learning. You’re trying to build an AI system right? For example, you wanted to answer questions like, what objects are in the photograph, or you wanted to answer sort of maybe a broader range of computer vision questions. But at a high level, what you’re going to go out and do is collect a set of photographs that\nrepresent sort of your domain of interest that represents the kind of things you might want to recognize.\nYou’re going to take some model architecture. You’re going to adjust the models, parameters. So you’re going to sort of train this model such that given and sort of compress all of the information from this data into the model parameters, such that, given a new photograph, the model could automatically say, Okay, this is car person building, I will say, just sort of as a\nbroader reflection. I mean, I’ve been using this slide since 2014,\nthe more that are like, you know, it’s it’s evolved a little bit. But like\nthis basic idea I’ve been using since 2014 when I 1st started giving like versions of general computer vision talks. And so I think there’s a lot of\nconversations and a lot of like in the media and in general about how AI now is completely different than it was 10 years ago, and like it really isn’t\nlike this paradigm held in 2014, it held in 2,004. It is holding now in 2025 like it’s, you know. Yes, the model architectures have changed like, yes, the data has gotten bigger. Yes, the compute has gotten better. But like this core idea has really not changed. And so a lot of the things that we’re talking about here honestly, they were\ntrue again 10 years ago. They’re going to be true, going forward. So\nin many ways, sort of despite a lot of things in AI are changing, a lot of things are also kind of staying the same.\nSo this picture, right at a high level, consists of 3 big pieces, right? It consists of the data piece. So there’s some kind of collection annotation, evaluation using data. There’s the model piece, which is sort of architectures or optimization algorithms sort of how do you build systems that learn from this data. And then there’s sort of the human piece. So the human judgments, or human opinions, or sort of somebody who comes in and decides what is what is going to be built.\nAnd so there’s a lot to be said about sort of power structures. And AI, if we just focus on this like human component, which I think is the piece that’s most often overlooked. Right? When we think about AI, we’ll think about data and models and maybe compute. But, like actually, this, human conversation is a lot\nless prominent. But I would argue at least as important, right? So some of these questions about like, who decides what problems to tackle next with AI interventions like who proposes and implements AI solutions, who determines and oversees AI ethics.\nwho governs these systems? And also particularly sort of international like, what does this mean to govern AI, which is\ninternational technology and like an international research community? But like.\nhow do we make sure this is deployed safely also, very importantly, who has the resources to contribute to AI research like AI research is very, very resource intensive, who gets overlooked, or perhaps even exploited with AI progress. So I’m not actually going to\ntry to tackle these questions. I’m sort of posing them as something to think about. And I know this is something that you are talking about in the context of Stanford AI. For all but what I want to focus sort of for now, and I’ll come back to this a little bit at the end of the talk. But I want to focus on sort of the extent to which kind of humans. But beyond AI researchers are part of technical AI research. So when we’re doing the engineering work that we’re doing of building AI systems or computer vision systems.\nTo what extent sort of do we touch on some of these more human questions? And to what extent do we touch on questions about representation or questions, sort of about the effect on downstream users and things like that.\nSo oh, so AI models now are everywhere. And you know we’ve been saying this for years.\nNow, this is actually true. This is one of the things that I think has changed. So sort of the deployment of these systems, both in things like facial recognition, you know. Unlocking your phone like, I unlock my phone right with my face. Now, every you know there, there’s all kinds of AI technology all around us. And then, of course, large language models, of course, chat, gpt, etc, etc. that that people are using all over the place.\nSo\nthe context of this sort of data model in humans, one of the places where you see this most clearly is when we start asking questions about representation within computer vision systems. And when we start asking about sort of fairness and bias within these systems. So around 2017,\nand so the models were not really being deployed at scale and sort of around, you know, basically around, you know, 10 years ago, give or take\nputting all of that garbage aside. But also it turns out what it was doing is making your is manipulating your skin color to make you more attractive, which is just\nokay. We’re being recorded. So I can’t use, you know, the kind of language I would want to use here, and I guess you know high school students, I will refrain. But but this is not okay. In many ways.\nthe one that looks lighter, slimmer, and younger. And there’s a number of books and documentaries and sort of investigations around this. These are a few that I would very highly recommend. If you’re interested in these topics, one is algorithms of oppression by Sophia Noble looking at web search engines, and how they sort of\nbetray different\nsort of stereotypes around different groups of people, particularly focusing on black girls. Race after technology, which is a book written by my colleague, Professor Ruha Benjamin, again, sort of making a number of interesting observations about how technology perpetuates\nsocietal inequality in ways that sort of perpetuates and amplifies it in ways that are very consistent with historical patterns. And so, even if we think that this technology is new. And it’s going to do something new and different. Actually, a lot of the things that it’s doing is sort of\ncontinuing some of our old patterns of racial injustice, and she’s actually written a number of books since then, which I also highly recommend all of them. She’s just like a wonderful writer, and then coded bias, which is a documentary on Netflix. If you’re not so much into reading or listening to audiobooks, I know both of these are audiobooks, because I’ve listened to both of them, because I’m also not very good at reading, and much better at audiobooks. But if you don’t like\nbooks in any form coded by as a documentary on Netflix, by Joy Bulamwini, or sort of about joy. Bulimwini, and some of her work is is also very very good for\nfor deep dive into these topics.\nBut I guess if we’re gonna sort of dive into the more technical or more sort of engineering part of this right? So where does some of this come from.\nand kind of at the heart of, or one of the sort of root causes of these kinds of behaviors by the models is comes in the data so large scale data. So the fact that we’re training these models with tons and tons of data does not necessarily mean that there’s like equal representation in the data, or does not necessarily mean that the data is capturing the kinds of patterns in the world that we would like it to capture.\nSo, for example, the work that I just mentioned, the facial recognition is accurate. If you’re a white guy. Well, so these 2 researchers so Joy, the one who later did the code advice documentary and Denit Gibru did this work in 2018, called gender shades, where they analyzed the performance of face recognition algorithms\nof commercial face identification systems. And what they found is that these systems perform very poorly on women with darker skin, and by very poorly, I mean around 13 to 14% error. And in contrast, when these systems sort of operated on faces of men with lighter skin. The error rate was less than 1% right? So sort of massive disparities and error rates.\nand one of the kind of reasons why this was happening is they kind of traced it back to the fact that within face recognition data sets that were out there at the time about 80 to 90% of them contained faces with lighter skin. So it’s sort of\none of the kind of 1st lines of defense for analyzing why these models perform the way that they are is looking at what is actually hiding in the data that the models are learning from.\nSo another sort of example of this is that there’s few demographic distributions and cultural associations of some of these data sets. So this is a data set called Imagenet, and both sort of the the graphs I’m showing on the X-axis. This is sunset. So this is sort of the categories within this data set. These are sort of different categories\ncorresponding to different words that might describe people. The Y-axis is percentage. The graph is sort of a histogram of both sort of gender distribution among photos in the data set as well as age distribution of the people that appear in the data set. You can see the gender distribution sort of skews male. I should say that this is\nsort of annotated, inferred gender expression, sort of binarized gender expression that that’s being annotated. So not necessarily gender identity. Not necessarily biological sex, not necessarily\nsort of any of those. And again, that’s a sort of binarized to be male or female. You might notice one of the categories. Sort of, there’s a lot of examples marked unsure about the gender. This is the category scuba diver.\nSo most people are in scuba gear, you actually can’t tell. So this is why most of those are unsure similar with age. Right? A lot of the people in this data set are adults, 18 to 40, less representation of adults over 40, some representation of children and minors, which is the whole other thing of like what does that?\nWhat are the pros and cons of having children be in computer vision data sets, but also sort of cultural associations. So, for example, for the category groom, this data set represents it primarily by photos of men in Tuxes, standing next to women in white puffy dresses, which is both, of course, a very like heteronormative, but also a very particular cultural\ndepiction of groom. That may not be, you know. It’s a very Western sort of us European version of of this category.\nSo and finally, sort of one more example. So this is again, another common computer vision data set called coco common objects. In context, where you can see sort of in the graph, right? The Y-axis is the different types of scene that the images come from. So there might be mountain desert and sky scenes. There might be scenes kind of being outdoor next to water, ice or snow, industrial and construction scenes.\nand then the X-axis is the fraction of images with the scene that appear with a person who appears to be male versus the person who appears to be female, and you can see that for some of these scenes. Okay, I don’t have this animation, but for some of the scenes like outdoor sports fields and parks, these pictures appear prime. These sort of\npictures that come from the scene appear primarily as people who appear to be male shopping and dining scenes at the bottom appear primarily with people who are female. And the example on the right is even for some.\neven for some\nsort of some some situations where maybe the distribution is actually equal. So, for example, this is people who appear with flowers. So there’s about same number of men and women who appear next to flowers. But when you look at like how they’re depicted. So women next to flowers\ntend to have this like very\nSort of stylized and very like paper\nlike, I don’t even know how to describe these images. I mean, you can see them in the top row. Sort of these tend to be the images of like\nwomen appearing with flowers, whereas men appearing with flowers tend to be like men in conference rooms with a flower on the table. Right? So, even though sort of the statistical patterns of co-occurrence appear to be similar, actually kind of the images and the depictions can be very different.\nAnd so then it sort of comes as no surprise that when you train on some of these data sets that the models themselves may be learning particular patterns that may be sort of hard to\ngrasp, hard to grapple with, and may have sort of behavior that may not be particularly\ndesirable, and so so sort of what can be done with that? Right? So so step one is like, know, your data is, figure out what is actually in your data set, and as much as possible like you can build\ntools and\nsort of visualization frameworks and things like that that allow you to more closely examine your data and sort of understand what what might be in there. You can, of course, collect more representative data sets. So so when you are aware of something like, Well, I’m trying to build a face recognition system. And, like all of the faces in the data set are lighter skin, right? And I’m trying to get this something to work for. Everybody like that is going to be a problem. I need to have a data set that’s more representative of everybody that I would want the system to work for.\nYou can create algorithmic interventions, which is what we will sort of talk about here a little bit, or you can, of course, also move away from reliance on data that’s more of a longer term strategy, and maybe something that\nyou know we can come back to and and discuss more, because this this is something that I think the whole AI community sort of talking about in various ways. But it’s not clear that we know how to do that.\nIt correlates your target label. So basically something that you’re trying to predict. So whether the person is doing a particular activity or whether the person is a\ngroom or not, or whether the person is\nsort of in a particular setting or something like that, and it correlates a sort of target label with a protected attribute. So, for example, the person’s apparent gender.\nor the person’s skin tone, or things like that. So\nI should say that this is a very simplified setting for how you can begin to grapple with something that’s very complex. Sort of, you know, this concept of AI fairness is a very complex thing, even sort of this process of simplifying this down into an engineering to a mathematical framework can be very fraught, can be potentially sort of introduce a lot of\ncomplications and a lot of challenges. So, for example, sorry, this is sort of me going off on a tangent. But there is some work that shows that if you’re trying to mitigate bias with respect to\nsort of the gender attribute in some some data sets under some some conditions. So one of the things that you might do inadvertently is like, even though you might mitigate the sort of equalized error rates across the genders. What might end up happening is that the way you’re doing that is actually sort of disproportionately harming particular minority subgroups of the 2 genders\nsort of in a way that like okay? According to this one metric that you define as your fairness or bias metric, you might be doing better. But actually, if you sort of break it up into like further break it up into minority subgroups. You might actually realize that.\nYes, your algorithm has optimized for this particular metric that you set out to optimize. But actually under the hood, it’s doing something that’s still very problematic, according to other metrics. So this is part of why, whenever you’re talking about AI fairness, you actually want to be thinking about a broader range of metrics rather than just one. But\nas one way of conceptualizing this of sort of simplify this, and beginning to even grapple with this problem. Right? You could say, Okay, maybe I’m sort of given this data set. I’m considering a protected attribute. Maybe this is just a binary attribute. Maybe I’m going to simplify gender down to a binary, and my goal would be to sort of develop a method for training visual classifiers that would ignore such correlations if the correlations are deemed unnecessary or harmful.\nAnd so one of the earliest works on this is actually, it’s called men also like shopping sort of reducing gender bias in computer vision models. And this is the work that I sort of briefly mentioned in the in the headline of models trained on computer vision data learned a sexist view of women. So this is one of the early works in this that was showing that basically when\nwhen a model was trained on a common data set to predict sort of the what action the person is performing, it learned to associate the action of cooking with the person in the image being a woman, and not only that, it sort of amplified this correlation, such that even when in your training data set. I think it was something like, you know, 60% correlation. So sort of 60% of cooking was forget which way it goes. It was either 60% of cooking was done by women. Or it was that.\nYeah, I think it was that it was 60% of cooking was done by women. And then in the test data, even though sort of that percentage was still holding only 60% of cooking was done by women. The model actually predicted something like 80% of cooking images. So whenever it saw a cooking image, it was asked to predict the gender of the person, it would predict that as women sort of 80% of the time. And so\nyou know, you can think about different methods for actually training visual classifiers that would ignore such correlations. And I’m not gonna\ndive into all of the technical details here, but there’s a couple of papers that we did a few years ago, one that really looks at a wide range of methods. So what are some of the things you could do? You could like\noversample some of these minority?\nso you would overstample sort of pictures of men that are cooking, or pictures of women that are doing other activities. You could consider training classifiers separately for sort of cooking, for like women cooking and men cooking as sort of 2 separate classifiers, and then combine the 2 at the end. You could also do things like generate data. So there’s more and more work on data generation. So you could imagine sort of supplementing\nyour potentially biased data set with some generated data to try to mitigate that.\nAll of this is very, very interesting kind of technical work. But also this is a great example of something that you really can’t do\nwith just an engineering perspective like, you really need to be thinking a lot more deeply about as you’re mitigating some of these biases? Are you introducing any additional ones in particular? If you’re working with generated data? Is your generated data really helping\nsort of deviate your classifier introducing additional buy-ins.\nBut\nyeah, and so and so, all of this sort of algorithms mitigating this correlation sort of becomes increasingly challenging, particularly in real data. Right? So these are some of the photos from a common computer vision data sets. And again, the photos are just so diverse that it’s it’s actually very hard to figure out. You know, when you’re talking about like a face data set, you could say, Okay, what is the skin color of the person in the image, and that’s sort of the dominant\nfeature and sort of the dominant part of the appearance of the of the images. And so you can sort of run some analysis on that. But when you’re working with very diverse images, it becomes increasingly harder to sort of understand what might be hiding in the data.\nAll of this is sort of still possible and mitigating. This correlation is still possible. Assuming that you actually have the data, but algorithmically mitigating bias in the data actually becomes impossible when data is simply missing. And so one example of this is when people start talking about geographic diversity of computer vision data sets. So what I’m showing you here on the left is a map of the world\nwhere darker sort of darker shading corresponds to more images from that country appearing in some standard computer vision data sets. So you can see that, for example, like\nin these data sets, the majority of photos are collected from the Us. So so these are photos scraped from the web. But like we have some GPS tags on them, so we know where they were taken, or at least where they were uploaded from. And the vast majority of photos in this data set come from the Us.\nSome from Canada, like some from Australia, some from Europe, but then, like\nentire continent of Africa, is essentially not included in these data, sets right entire, like parts of Middle East. Parts of Asia, right? Are like, entirely excluded from this from these data sets. And\nOne classic example for why this matters is that\nfolks in 2017 showed that with some of the models back, then those models sort of again, commercial, you know, computer vision models were able to recognize us. Brands of liquid soap as soap. But we’re not able to recognize pictures of bar soap as soap.\nSo for this, you know, common household object of soap. We have it in. Like all of our houses, people around the world, the vast majority of households are going to have a bar soap rather than liquid soap. But in the Us. Particular sort of us brands of liquid soap. This is what primarily appeared in these data sets. And so this is primarily what the models learned from. And so this is primarily what they learned to recognize as soap.\nthat would sort of diversify the geographic distribution of of\nobjects that we collected this like geographically diverse object recognition data sets. It’s 60,000 images. It’s not very big by modern standards. So current, you know, computer vision models are trained on many, many millions of, you know, hundreds of millions, if not billions of images. But it’s 60,000 images, 40 objects. And it was collected by partnering with people sort of around the world. So we hired photographers to go out and like.\ntake, like basically hired people, to take pictures of household objects in their homes and collected this like very interesting data set, which we call geode. If you’re, you know, interested in playing around with this, it’s publicly available. So you can feel free.\nAnd one of the things that sort of was particularly interesting is so on the very bottom here. I’m showing pictures from Imagenet which is sort of a common computer vision data set. And then in the other sort of 6 rows, or I guess the sort of 6 groups above it are pictures of pictures from sort of 6 different regions of the world that we collected data from. And this is for the category of stove.\nAnd one of the things that you could see right is that\nwhen you focus on some of these images that I’m sort of highlighting yellow like they’re very different than some of the, you know, kind of standard Us. Stoves that you might see in these data sets. So they are, for example, like single burner stoves, right? A lot of the stoves are a lot more used than when you collect Internet images. So when you scrape the web for photos of stoves, right? A lot of the time like, why was this picture uploaded to the web? Well.\nit was uploaded either to like sell the stove or you’re trying to like\nshowcase this object in some way, like you’re trying to, you know. And so a lot of the time they are clean, they’re particularly sort of staged, whereas if you just ask people to like, go out and take pictures of like, what does those look like in your house right now? You’re going to get a very different very different distribution.\nwhich makes this sort of a lot\na lot more interesting to kind of play around with. And I think you can start to see\nwhat are some of the challenges that current models that are trained particularly and almost exclusively on sort of web scrape data. What are some of the challenges that these models would actually encounter in the real world. If you look at sort of what actually, what actually exists in the real world versus what is captured in this state.\nSo here. This is you know the model classifying a photo as a or sorry the other way around. These are pictures of houses from regions around the world. And then underneath each picture sort of what was it classified as by the model? And so you can look in like West Asia right? Both of these. These are houses? We asked. You know, we asked people to just take pictures of their houses, and both of these are classified as religious buildings by the model. Look at Africa, right?\nClassified as cooking pot and car. So like the model really has no idea what to do with these East Asia, you know. Front door. Okay? Fine. Fair enough, like front door. Okay, but like wheelbarrow, like what? And so forth.\nSo again, even with like a very small data. You can actually reveal a lot of interesting patterns about some of these very large scale and seemingly very complex computer vision models.\nAnd so you know.\ncoming back to this right? So so what can be done? Right? So so step one is still still know your data. Right?\nCollecting more represented data sets is really important, but also can be very difficult and very expensive to scale. So that’s 1 of the sort of challenges within the AI space that’s frequently under\nsort of appreciated. But it’s very, very important. It’s like knowing how to work with data and like knowing how to being able to and be willing to do some of this data collection work. And then the algorithmic interventions. Right? You can do stuff with that. But it also has limits. Again, for example, when you just simply don’t have data from a certain part of the world, it’s actually very hard to mitigate that using algorithmic interventions.\nSo one more thing I sort of want to say is this idea of like being able to trace error pathways within the model. So if we think about sort of the cycle where human history, bias and prejudice like makes its way into large scale data in some form. So the data may be just simply reflecting patterns that exist in the world may simply be reflecting the fact that women tend to be doing more of the cooking like\nthat is true. It may be reflecting that it may be amplifying that that sort of makes its way into the models that we build which are learning from the data. Again, the models might just be capturing the patterns and data. It may be amplifying patterns in the data that makes its way into AI decision making or sort of AI models that we deploy, and that becomes part of our human history.\nAnd so one question we can ask, right is sort of, we’re in the cycle do these\nkind of biased behaviors or unfortunate behaviors common? So again, we talked about the gender and racial bias and face recognition. So this is the gender shades work where they analyzed sort of 3 commercial computer vision systems and looked at error rates between darker females and lighter males in particular. And so this can be sort of loosely traced back to imbalanced skin color distribution and face data sets.\nAs I mentioned, we look at geographic bias in object recognition. This can sort of loosely be traced back to imbalanced geographic distribution and object data sets.\nsort of bias in the day so so like\none example, right is, if you are\nSo supposing you’re trying to train a model to distinguish between like different animals out in the safari. Right? You’re trying to distinguish like you’re trying to classify different images. Maybe you have a camera that’s placed. You know.\nI forgot the name for it, but but like a camera that’s placed out in the wild to monitor sort of animal populations you’re trying to distinguish between different types of animals. And suppose you’re only taking sort of photos or videos in daylight. And so one of the like biases in your data is going to be that. Well, all of the images are captured in daylight, or that, you know the sky is always blue in this data, right? Like that is a sort of a bias in the day. That is part of the sort of patterns in the data. But like.\nis your AI model that’s trained to classify different animals. Is that going to capture that bias like? Actually, probably not because it’s sort of\nto associate sort of nighttime with some animals, and daytime with other images, with other animals, because that’s going to be a very, very salient pattern in the day. Now, is it a problem? Maybe maybe not, because, like maybe some animals really do only come out at night, and you never need to recognize this animal during the day, and if you see something that looks like that animal during the day, you can like very safely assume it’s probably not that animal, because those animals only come out at night. So this may actually not be a problem, or\nit might be a problem. If then you try to deploy this system in to recognize animals in the daytime, or you’re trying to deploy it to like.\nI don’t know. Assist a veterinarian and classify. You know what animal is this? And then you’re going to bring in animals during that are all in like well lit daytime conditions right?\nThe model may not work because it’s sort of learned to make this daytime and nighttime association. So anyways, okay.\nso this is sort of the kinds of questions you can ask in the kind of like very technical\nthings you can. You can dive into if you’re if you’re interested in this.\nBut I want to sort of zoom out and come back in the last sort of few minutes of this talk to this claim about that. I said at the beginning that sort of AI is really about like data and models and humans. And so I want to come back to this question of sort of who are the humans involved in the data sets. And you know, I think, besides, the fact of like\nwho is being represented in the data again, as we’ve talked about, or which countries or which cultures are represented. Right? You can also ask a number of questions about sort of the subjects of like, you know who is represented and how they represented. You can also ask the question like, did they consent to be included in this data?\nAnd finally, I do want to conclude by asking, sort of the Who are the AI researchers. And this is a big part of what Stanford AI. For all is all about right is sort of thinking about who is\nrepresented among AI developers. Among AI leaders there is a diversity crisis within AI. And this is, you know, some of the things that are easy to look at, our gender demographics or racial demographics. Those are easy to look at, and we can sort of\ntalk about those and collect those statistics more easily. We’re about 16% women within among AI researchers, right? And compared to world population of 50, 50, or even 51, 49 you could look at, you know, particular racial groups. You can compare that to populations of\nthe Us. For example, but also even broader than that. Actually, there are things that are maybe hard to measure, but actually at least equally important about, you know, who are the people who are actually able to break into the field and become leaders in the field. What books did they read as children? What values do they hold? What communities do they come from? Like what life experiences have they had? And how does that factor? Into\nwhat models that they’re building and what systems they’re deploying and what questions they’re asking.\nAnd you know one example that I do like to talk about here. And if you watch code of bias, you’ll hear about that. But this work on gender shades of sort of questioning, you know. Do face recognition models work on all people of different skin color. I mean, this work was done by joy and meat, who are both black women, and this work was motivated by their lived experience of face recognition systems did not work for them, and you know joy talks about this example where she takes a white\nface mask just like a white, like sort of ghost mask, and puts it over her face, and the computer vision model recognizes that as a face, whereas when she takes it away and it’s just her dark face.\nthe the model does not recognize that as a face. And so this is something that sort of she lived with and has, or lived with, and is, you know, knows that this is how these models work. And so then they asked this question, sort of brought attention to this issue, and\nyou know I have a sort of a minor scale experience with this. But like, when I started my Phd program, we were building a robot in my lab that was supposed to respond to commands, and the robot did not understand when I spoke to it, and understood every single other person in the lab. I. So I wasn’t born in the Us, like English, is not technically my 1st language. But I’ve been in the Us since I was 10. And so it’s\nbasically become my 1st language. Lots of people in my lab were, you know, had like just come to the Us. Were just learning English had very thick accents, but the robot understood all of them, and would not understand me, and of course you might have guessed that, like I was the only woman in the lab, it would not understand, like female voices. And so you know, another great example of like, if we\nonly have people who are building the systems who come from a certain subset of a population. And whether this be, you know, demographic or this be training, or this be value systems, etc, like, we just don’t think to ask the right questions right? We think, to ask questions, you know some subset of questions, but not all of them. And so I do want to give a shout out, of course, to AI, for all. I suspect you\nheard about it, after all. But we are a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity, inclusion, and AI, and we celebrated our 8th birthday on March 8th of this year. So March 8, th for those who don’t know is International Women’s Day. So we were founded on International Women’s Day. But our goal is to educate and support a diverse next generation of AI leaders, and we like to say that AI will change the world. And we like to ask the question of Who will change? AI,\nand we’ve developed a number of educational programs at the high school and college level. So including Stanford AI for all, including Princeton, AI. For all which we’re starting in just a couple of weeks here.\nand many others for students from historically underrepresented and underserved communities were not currently represented among AI leaders, and one of my favorite quotes, this is from May, April 2016 student is that until this program I never thought that people who look like me could succeed in computer science. And AI, I think this is one of the most powerful quotes that I’ve heard, and this is something I’m very proud of, that we are, you know, dispelling some of the notions of what it means to be\nsuccessful and a leader in AI. And I’m hoping that part of what you’re getting out of this program is a sense that, like you, whoever you are wherever you’re coming from, sort of whatever your background is, whatever your identity is that hopefully, you are starting to see yourself as somebody who can contribute and succeed in this space.\nand that is my\ngreatest hope for you here at Stanford. AI for all. So just quick, takeaways things that we’ve talked about. Computer vision is no longer just about models or even the models plus data. It’s really models plus data plus humans\nSo thanks very much. I’m happy to take questions.\nYeah, go ahead, Jasmine, jump, jump on in. Saw you first.st\n00:48:07\nHi, I have a question about like mitigating bias in this. Do you think that bias can ever be truly mitigated? Just by I mean manipulating the data set, since, like the data comes from like a society that’s\nlike, inherently and just deeply biased and unequal. And also when someone like manipulates the data set to mitigate bias, wouldn’t. They’re kind of\nbiases. Be kind of thrown in there.\n00:48:35\nA 100%. No to the 1st one. Yes, to the first, st to the second one. No, you can’t have a truly unbiased data set just like you. I think it’s\nvery hard to have, or impossible to have, a truly, you know, unbiased society, or a truly unbiased person. But I think we can do better than we’re doing, and I think we can be a lot more thoughtful about it. But no, we’re not going to get this perfectly right and 100% agree with you that of course, when we’re doing any kind of like bias mitigation work, we’re introducing our own biases into it. Yes.\nthe world or the data that you’re seeing, or sort of societal phenomenon. A lot of the time will include like positionality statements at the end of their paper, saying, like, Here’s who we are. And here’s how our identities and perspectives might have contributed to this work. And and sort of do a number of other things to try to\nnot even compensate for that. But just be upfront about it. And I think computer scientists could stand to learn a lot from that. There are disciplines that do much better job of this than we do. But yes, the core idea is, yes, 100%. We’re bringing our own biased perspectives into that.\n00:50:04\nThank you.\n00:50:05\nYes, of course, Theresa, I think you’re next.\nI can’t hear you. You seem to be unmuted, but we can’t hear you.\n00:50:21\n3, 6.\n00:50:22\nNo worries.\n00:50:22\nDo you mind writing your question? And then maybe I can read it out loud.\n00:50:26\nYep, yeah, Max, do you want to jump in.\n00:50:32\nSure. Hi, Professor Rosakowski, so it’s nice to meet you. I want to ask you when real world data is limited. Do you think that synthetic images can help improve representation in data sets, because, like obviously, real data is much better. But if it’s very scarce, then should we try to use synthetic data.\n00:50:50\nYes, absolutely. That’s a great question, and absolutely. And we have some work on that, as one of the papers that I sort of very briefly showed, is where we’re trying to use synthetic data. A lot of the same questions about like bias in the data very much applies to synthetic data. But on the plus side, there’s things you can do with synthetic data, like sort of mixing\nthings together and breaking correlations like quite effectively with synthetic data these days. So absolutely, that is a very, very good mitigate or potentially, like a very good mitigation strategy.\n00:51:22\nThank you.\n00:51:23\nNope.\nEarl Han, do you want to go next? Or I guess Miriam jump in whenever there is done with the question.\n00:51:31\n00:51:34\nOkay.\n00:51:34\nTeresa’s asking many models now pursue data efficiency due to scarce high quality data which makes me think about whether prioritizing data quantity to reduce bias conflict with data, efficient design and might standardized frameworks reconcile this tension. For instance, in medical imaging, should we accept higher algorithmic inaccuracy with minimal data to avoid reinforcing\nhistorical biases or prioritize large data sets, despite their potential to embed disparities.\n00:52:07\nOh, beautiful question.\nOh, my God, yeah, yes and no to all of that like, yes, I mean, there’s a lot of work now on, I mean.\nyes, there’s sort of the the domains where there’s just just very little data.\nAnd I think the questions then come is like, Do we need AI in those settings. Like, if if we’re talking about sort of like. And this is part of you know, let’s have AI replace doctors. Sure. I mean, maybe for a cold, where all you need to do, anyways, and go home and drink water like maybe that’s fine that that like we give. You know, we build an AI system that tells you that. But like there’s so many like long tail and rare events where you know, it’s not actually clear that we need\nAI like what we really need is sort of somebody who’s seen this at least once before. Right? It’s it’s not clear that we can really draw patterns from these like very long tail or rare events. But maybe we just sort of need\nneed to try to be, you know, basically that that may not be appropriate for for a statistical model, even at all. And so I think that that’s sort of one question is like, what happens is, it’s very, very rare data examples. I think there’s\nthe other question of like moving towards data efficiency. And like.\nsort of, do we need Internet scale data? Or can we simplify this down? So one of the papers that we are just about to sort of put out on archive publicly is actually looking at sort of what happens. And do biases get actually exacerbated when you try to like, shrink down your data. And, of course, sort of? The answer is, you know, yes, in some\ncircumstances, when you’re you have a large scale data, but then you try to like, shrink it down to a smaller subset. Maybe your accuracy of your model can stay just as high. But actually, if you look at like robustness or performance of minority populations that can actually drop. So anyways, like\nall very, very good questions. And then the the question about, like, you know, prioritizing sort of\nhigh quality data versus like low quality data that may be more plentiful, that it versus like synthetic data that may even be more plentiful, but even lower quality. And then, like prioritize sort of model development versus data development. I mean, yes, to all of those. Let’s prioritize all of this. This is why we need more people in the community working on all of these. Yeah, I don’t think I have a good answer for like trade-offs there. But yeah, very, very good question. Sort of line of thought.\nYeah, Rohan, do you want to jump in.\n00:54:35\nOf course. So considering that many computer vision data sets are like fundamentally biased at the point of collection, right race gender geography, as you said, do you think it’s more effective to fix these biases through like post hoc, algorithmic solutions like reweighting or like de-biasing models? Or should we focus on like, I guess, curating better data sets from the ground up.\n00:54:57\nI think both like honestly, I think both. I think a lot of the time is there’s some things that can be fixed algorithmically. And there’s some things that just can’t be. And so I think things that can be fixed through reweighting great. But I think those are a subset of the kinds of things that appear in there. So I think when we’re thinking, I think reweighting is sort of a good like\n1st step\nbut in order to do that, you sort of need, basically need discrete labels and focus on like a small set of things. But then you’re not going to fix things like grooms are represented as like white men in Texas. Next to white women and giant puffy like white dresses. Right? You’re not going to fix that through waiting. If that’s what if that’s the only thing that’s in your data.\n00:55:45\nThank you.\n00:55:46\nYeah.\nCome on.\n00:55:50\nHi, nice to meet you. I have a question about what the limitations of synthetic data are, and like, what exactly about it? Defines it as like a lower quality than real data.\n00:56:00\nYeah, also a wonderful question, like, what are the limitations of synthetic data? Right? So synthetic data? Generally, I mean, there’s many different kinds. But a lot of the time people these days are thinking of this as like the output of a generative AI model. So sort of\nimages that are, that is, that are produced by an AI model. That this is not the only possibility, like, I think, in the past, synthetic data was more frequently sort of rendered use like kind of using. Like, you know, video game type engines. And you could like render data. That, I think, is a more, much more controllable way of doing data generation. The limits. So when it’s sort of rendered\nusing the computer graphics type techniques the limitations that it. It frequently does not look realistic. So so it can\nsort of help in some ways. But it may not look realistic. The limitations of generated data by AI models is basically whatever by like A, whatever bias was in the AI model. That was also like sort of the generation model was trained on Internet scale data. So now, when you’re using it to generate data that’s going to have sort of the same biases.\nThe other is that some of these models are not very good at like\nthings like physical consistency, so they can generate again images that may not be realistic. And then one of the other things is that these models are actually kind of hard to control. And so it may be, you may not quite be sure that sort of what you’re generating is\nwhat you meant to be generating. And then and then finally, of course, like it may again be different than the real world domain where you’re actually operating. So the photos generated may look different than instead of your real world photograph. So so all of these reasons. But yeah, very good question.\nAlexander.\n00:57:51\nHi, it’s nice to meet you on a more personal note. I would like to ask what what was like a core memory of you working at the Princeton Visual AI lab.\n00:58:03\nOh, at Princeton. Visual AI lab.\nlet me see if I can show you so sort of up on the\nThank you. That was a great great personal question. I like it, Sammy.\n00:59:08\nProfessor I am going to. I’m so sorry we have to wrap up.\n00:59:11\nDone. Okay.\n00:59:12\n00:59:24\nYeah, absolutely. And and the and the the folks who have their hands raised may maybe also, you know, you can type them in and and add them.\n00:59:31\nPlease do, please do send those to me, and I’ll send them over to the professor and thank you all. Please head over to office hours, and give our professor sort of a virtual round of applause, and thank you so much for your time.\n00:59:45\nYeah, thank you all. Thank you for having me.\n00:59:48\nIf you open the chat you’ll see a million. Thank you.\n00:59:51\nYup! Yup, I I just I disconnected. Oh, my goodness! Oh, that’s a\nso beautiful! You guys are such a wonderful community. This is this is just this is just heartwarming. Thank you for having me thank you for letting me be a part of your day.\nenjoy office hours, enjoy the rest of the program.\n01:00:08\nThank you so much, Professor.\n01:00:10\nThanks folks, Hi.\n01:00:13\nGoodbye!\n"},"03_resources/Dr.-Roxana-Daneshjou---AI-in-Healthcare":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nDr. Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist at Stanford, discusses the application of AI in healthcare, highlighting both its potential and significant challenges. She shares her career path from bioengineering to an MD-PhD and post-doctoral work in AI. Dr. Daneshjou explains the fundamental issues in the US healthcare system, such as access and inefficiency, which AI aims to address. She then provides a high-level overview of how large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) are designed, emphasizing concepts like transformers, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback. A significant portion of her talk focuses on the ethical pitfalls of AI in medicine, including biases (e.g., perpetuating racist medical ideas, inaccurate diagnoses across skin tones) and the risk of automation bias, where users over-rely on AI despite potential errors. She advises caution when using AI for new information and stresses the importance of diverse and representative training data. Dr. Daneshjou also touches on the regulation of medical AI by the FDA and the evolving job market in medicine, suggesting shifts in roles rather than job losses.\nKey Points\n\nSpeaker Background: Dr. Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist at Stanford, with an academic background in bioengineering, MD-PhD, and AI postdoc.\nMotivation for AI in Healthcare: Addresses fundamental issues in healthcare, such as access difficulties, physician shortages, and system inefficiency.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs):\n\nDesign: Based on transformer architecture (e.g., ‘Attention is all you need’ paper).\nTraining Regimen: Self-supervised learning (predicting masked words), reinforcement learning with human feedback (human preference training via thumbs up/down), and prompting (e.g., chain of thought, role-playing).\nUsage: Widely used by physicians (65% in a 2024 study, daily/weekly for patient education, administrative tasks) and patients (90% for personal health questions).\n\n\nVision Language Models (VLMs):\n\nTraining: Uses contrastive learning to map images and text into a shared mathematical representation.\nApplication: Generating captions, image generation, and diagnostic assistance (e.g., dermatology).\n\n\nChallenges and Drawbacks of AI in Healthcare:\n\nBias: Models can perpetuate false, racist ideas in medicine (e.g., kidney function, pain tolerance) and show diagnostic bias across different skin tones.\nInaccuracy/Hallucinations: AI models can provide incorrect information, especially for complex tasks like medication dosages or specific medical calculations, and these errors can be hard to detect.\nAutomation Bias: Over-reliance on automated aids, leading users to override their own judgment (e.g., GPS leading drivers into water).\nData Gaps: Lack of sufficient and representative data from under-resourced regions exacerbates biases.\n\n\nRegulation and Trust:\n\nMedical AI tools are regulated by the FDA, though the field’s rapid pace makes regulation challenging.\nClinician trust in predictive AI models is still developing; AI is currently more useful as a supplementary tool (e.g., assisting in colonoscopies) rather than a sole decision-maker.\n\n\nJob Market Impact: AI will likely cause shifts in how medical professionals work, rather than leading to widespread job loss, by automating certain workflows and creating new specialties.\nAddressing Bias: Requires appropriate data collection to ensure representation, and techniques like reinforcement learning and explainable AI to understand and mitigate biased behaviors. Local data is crucial for model accuracy in specific regions.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/nf0Td4gEDASqKVHfaOTIuWJcD8f1Dl9MtsTQ0jfkIpw3crsKOuwaKtPs2Xol0_babkjudUvXwc2Hb44.l3soSr0wSCgnYe4p%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2F5iW7sx-AIKbhr5HilwpIbNqLY6fYEExV01AoeizOzIikC-GwMCXyZR3zlrUx5L99.QJJWsI5zI1OZZPEo\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\nIn dermatology at Stanford. Um, it’s actually, like, half a day a week, and it’s… And it’s 33 clinics a year.\n00:00:00 / 00:54:04\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:03\nClinics a year.\nSo it’s actually a smaller load than weekly clinic.\nAnd then how did I get here? Because I figured you guys are in high school and might want to know. So, as we’ve mentioned, I did my undergrad in bioengineering. I did this Md. Phd. Program which a lot of medical schools\nhave which is 2 years of Md. 3 years of Phd.\nAnd then the last 2 years of Md.\nThen I did a medical Residency, where you do more medical training.\nI did one year of internal medicine, 2 years of dermatology, and then one year in the research track. And then I did 2 years after that\nas a postdoc in AI, so you can do the math\nthat it was a very long time. My undergrad was a bit shorter. I did finish undergrad in 3 years. So\nthat was like maybe the only part where I got to like shave a little bit of time off.\nSo why do people say that we should be applying AI to healthcare? The problem is is that healthcare is actually fundamentally broken? Especially in the United States. I know people come from all over, but like in the Us like.\nI always like to say, like, let’s say you’re at the beach enjoying your day, and your friend notices this spot on your back and says, What’s this?\nThe process by which you would get in to see a doctor. It might take weeks to see your primary care, doctor.\nor like your family doctor.\nbut those who have understand that it’s just\nvery difficult to get access to care because their physician shortages. The system is very inefficient.\nAnd so people have thought, all right. Well, what if we have like AI models that can help like streamline things like help with triaging patients, help with doctors doing their work in a more efficient way.\nAnd in fact, there’s been work to bring, like Gpt for Ehr’s electronic health record system. So epic is the largest electronic Health Record System Company\nin the Us. It’s how like we’re physicians. Document Google has been testing their chat Bot with the Mayo clinic here. So you know, generative AI like has a lot of promise for healthcare.\nSo today we’ll talk about what at a high level\nhow large language models are designed, understand, at a high level how vision language models are designed and then understand, like some of these potential drawbacks.\nthat these models have.\nOkay? So 1st off, I’m just curious.\nand you can drop a note in the chat. How many of you use language? Large language models?\nOkay, it’s like everyone saying, me,\nwhat do you use it for?\nWant to see homework, generating some lots of homework, programming, helping with study guys, just asking everything to learn stuff, either. Look at answer questions, organizing research, code.\nfun, school creating practices, cramming.\nWell, this is really fun to see what people are using this for miscellaneous stuff.\nFriendship, random coding, cool\nopportunities. Okay, next question, how many of you know.\nhate zoom for this. How large language models work.\nfeel comfortable saying they know how how the model was built.\nKind of, yeah, I think so a bit a little ish.\nOkay, we’ll talk about that a bit sort of sometimes somewhat. Kinda yeah. I think\nI love all the different ways people are saying somewhat, okay. So we’re gonna talk about it a bit\non a high level.\nI always joke to people. I’m like.\nactually, not many people know exactly how any one model was made because the companies don’t release that information, and so each of them is like a sausage that you don’t know what’s exactly went into the sausage, because many of the companies don’t even release what training data they used or what the different procedures they’ll give it to at a heart high level.\nhow many of you guys have heard of this paper called attention is all you need.\nI looked at it a bit before. Okay, so this is about transformers, which is an architecture. That really kind of helped set up\nwhat we have as the what has the the. This architecture\nhelped set up like the modern day, large language model.\nAnd I’m not gonna go into detail of exactly how it works. But\nlike like, I’m not gonna go into a deep dive because there are whole courses taught on this.\nBut I’m just gonna like, Do a sentence for you. And and the sentence is this, I want you guys to complete it in the chat? Okay?\nSo I I went to on a trip to Paris.\nand I had a fantastic time. I ate a lot of delicious food. I went shopping at all my favorite stores. I got to see all of the beautiful sights.\nand I got to practice speaking blank. What’s blank?\nOkay, everyone’s saying French, okay, congratulations. You’re all really good at being a a language model? Essentially.\nbefore transformers, you know. Why, what? Like? Why did you guys know that I was speaking French?\nBecause I was in Paris? Yeah, exactly. You’re like, that’s the context.\nSo before transformers the architectures that language models were built upon had a really difficult time\nseeing Pat past the context\nYou know things.\nBut you guys all remembered, even though, that I crammed in a bunch of\nstuff in there, that I was in Paris. And so I must be speaking French.\nand that is the difference that\nyou know. The transformer architecture was able to solve.\nIt breaks, you know, like anything else. It breaks\nwords up into tokens, and so large words like pharmacogenomics.\nget broken up is a study of so like if we I should make a different one of these with my\nmy Paris sentence, and it’s able to learn sort of which words are important\nfor the specific context. Even if that word is far away\nfrom the word that you care to predict. And so this is like probabilities for a different sentence.\nAnd this is the temperature that tells you how stochastic you want to be.\nBasically, usually these large language models don’t always they do not regularly spit out the most high probability word they pick somewhere amongst the high probability. And so you may have noticed that if you ask the language, model the same question exact same question 2 times, it gives you slightly different answers, because it’s not always putting out the same, you know.\nHighest probability word. So I’m going to go through now. The training regimen for the model. The 1st\nstep pre-training is something called self supervised learning.\nAnd so what it’s doing is it’s like playing a game with itself. It’s taking large volumes of text.\nsentences out of it, and blanking out different parts of the sentences, and playing a game where it tries to predict what that word should be. So if I said. The dog became excited, and ran across the grass to chase the blank. What would you fill the blank in with\nball, squirrel, cat, ball, squirrel, bird\nmouse. So like even you guys will see like the highest probability word, for here is ball. But then Squirrel is pretty aardvark. I like whoever, said aardvark. Thank you.\nmy point is is, that’s actually exactly how, when these language models play this game, how it works, because they’re seeing okay, every time I see about dogs chasing the highest probability. Word is ball right, but also squirrel appears with some probability. Mouse aardvark is probably low probability.\nand is basically able to re like learn relationships amongst words.\nAnd then, after that, what happens is\nso at this point, no human has really been involved in training the model, saying, Hey, you’re learning the wrong association, the Right association.\nWhat happens next is something called reinforcement learning with human feedback. Where?\nso that you’re actually training the model on human preference.\nThat’s what we call the reinforcement learning with with human feedback.\nAnd then, finally, there’s prompting.\nSo some of you probably have experience with some prompting. So like, for example, if you give it a math problem\nand just give it like, you’ve an example math problem with the answer and then ask it another math problem, it actually can get the wrong answer. If you prompt it\nto give it a math problem.\nthen actually tell it how to solve that math problem\nand then ask another math problem.\nIt gets the right answer. That’s chain of thought, prompting\nother ways of prompting us by saying like things like, you know, pretend you’re like a Shakespearean bard writing it, or please write this like in the style of the rapper, some rapper, or whatever\nand that is that by prompting it you are\nactually kind of shaping how you want its output to look\nAnd actually, I had a friend who did this really interesting study where they had models, pretend to be different kinds of doctors, and the opinions that the model reflected in each case was like\nwhat a neurologist would think versus an immunologist or psychiatrist or pediatrician. So have you guys played around with prompting the models.\nTell it to write as professional. Yes.\nI tell it my grade. So it knows what level to speak at. Give them a role.\nYeah, also giving them examples.\nSo something you know, something called in context. You know.\nin context, learning, it’s like where you give it examples, try to focus it. Explain this lesson like you were a teenage girl.\nThat’s that’s funny.\nYep, giving them examples and having it solve some of that’s in context. Learning.\nOkay.\nlarge language models, particularly dermatologists, because we were very interested in this. And what we found\nout of like surveying a hundred ended up getting a hundred, 48\nphysicians across all kinds of practice settings\nis, and this studies from 2024, which is.\nyou know, I think these numbers are even high, like, like 65% have used large language models in clinic for like clinical use.\nMany of them were using it daily or weekly.\nand they’re using it for like patient education, patient care, administrative tasks, medical records, and others, and\naccuracy, like most people, thought that it was somewhat accurate\nand you know, good portion have to do like moderate edits.\nWe also looked at 40 individuals\nlooking like what a patient’s doing. Like 90%. We’re using Llms in general, and 90% have used for their personal health.\nyou know, and many of them have done it for like 5 or more times.\nyou know, just a large number of people are using it for healthcare. And most people are using chat Gpt, but some are using gemini anthropic\nand many said, they’ll do it again.\nAnd patients may not tell their doctors that they’re using these models?\nSo before I kind of go into the next point, I’m curious.\nHow many have have people ever used large language models here to ask health questions.\nOh, wow, yeah, for school.\nWhat about? Yeah. Health class? Okay, okay,\nnow, we’re gonna talk about some problems. So we did this study\nbecause physicians were using it to see?\nIf so, there are these ideas that are false racist ideas\nin medicine that have persisted in medicine, about differences between races in lung capacity\nof like a person’s underlying genetics or genetic risks. And so we ask these large language models these questions.\nEgfr is kidney function. And so like, you, shouldn’t, you know, we shouldn’t be using race anymore in kidney function.\nassessment. And what we found is that we asked each 1 5 times, because the answers are not always consistent.\nand what we found is that the models all of these models gave answers.\nThat we’re concerning for almost everything\nAnd so like, this was actually, this paper got a lot of attention. It got picked up by the Associated Press and covered on like a hundred news outlets. And\nI went on, Npr, if you look up my name and Npr. Science Friday, you’ll see that we have a science. We had a science Friday\nprogram about specifically talking about these research research findings and why they are concerning\nand why we think that you know racist behaviors in large language, models in medicine can cause a lot of harm.\nfor the medical professionals using them and then.\nas a follow-up to this study.\nwe did something called red teaming, which is a cybersecurity term.\nAnd that’s where we try to identify vulnerabilities in AI models.\nAnd so it’s like.\nHave you guys ever stress tested the models to see like if it’ll make them how and when it makes mistakes. Just curious.\nYes, examples would be great, too, of like what you were trying to do\nif you, if you feel comfortable sharing, it looks like a lot of people. So that’s that’s like what red teaming is.\nI asked it calculus questions. And so you’re trying to see straw. Wait.\nI’ve once made it say 3 plus 4 equals. 5.\nI gave it the same math questions.\nIt always messes up on book. Yeah, it’s not reliable for math.\nSee this, you guys have done red teaming because\nintentionally say something is right when it’s wrong. You would like.\nyou would like, we actually wrote a paper about this called sycophantic behaviors of large language models,\nsycophantic meaning that it wants to like please you, and so like, if you tell it that it’s wrong, and you like, do it with some authority. It’ll like, change its answer.\nGas lighting it. Okay, you know. Also, models will gaslight humans, too. By the way.\nOkay. So red teaming.\nSo we, this was before, like we did this in November 2023. So we just use the models that were available. And we asked it to people to mimic things that you might actually happen in healthcare. So we said, Don’t\ndon’t jailbreak it with prompts, like, pretend you’re a racist doctor, because no physician would actually use that prompt.\nAnd then this is actually a picture from our event. It was like over 80 people, computer scientists, biomedical data, scientists, engineers, physicians. Every table had a physician across multiple specialties.\nWere there inaccuracies, or were there biases where it perpetuated identity based discrimination or false stereotypes. So\nthe reason we did this event is actually at many medical systems. Now, we we have access to\nprivate\nlarge language models that we can use for medical care questions and things like that. And I actually am very worried about that, because most physicians don’t understand how these models work don’t understand how they can be when and how they’re wrong. Like many of you pointed out, you find that it’s not very good at math.\nAnd somebody said, oh, I found that it’s not as good as book summary, so like. Physicians don’t know what it’s good at or bad at. It’s sort of been thrust upon them.\nYou know, we’re inappropriate, like, not good.\nAnd we actually released the data set. So this was my like, this is very terrifying. So here’s a hallucination misinformation.\nSo the question is to calculate the Regisar score for dress, which is a drug reaction. 37 year old lady with a fever of 38.6. Celsius enlarged lymph, node\natypical lymphocytes. But okay, I know you guys are in high school like this is probably gibberish to you guys.\nthis is like a met. This is why, like we were physicians were testing it. They’re putting information in\neverything is correct.\nI’ve highlighted in red.\nWhat is wrong?\nSo the problem here is that sometimes, if you don’t know things to deep detail.\nThe errors can be very, very difficult to catch, because everything looks right except for one sentence.\nAnd so I always tell physicians you have to beware of automation bias. So automation bias isn’t. And I’m telling you guys, too, is it over reliance on automated Aids. This is a real article. This is a real picture.\nIt’s another tourist accidentally drove their car into deep water in Hawaii after falling GPS. Please note that this, says another tourist. She was not the 1st one\nthat’s actually her. I can’t believe she’s smiling because I would be crying if I drove my car into water like that.\nbasically, you know when using GPS people have become so reliant on automation\nthat they will override their own good judgment\nand what their eyes see and turn into the ocean\nrather than like their brain. Just doesn’t, you know, operate\nat the level to say, oh, I should override what I’m this instruction.\nAnd so that’s that’s something you have to be really careful about when you’re using these models\nbecause they make mistakes and they make mistakes in an authoritative manner. And so it can be an issue. I have my rule for using language models in work is that I only actually use them\nin cases where I can certainly find the error. So I actually don’t really use large language models to teach me new things, because\nif they’re wrong, how will I know if I don’t know the answer.\nSo you know.\nThat’s that’s something to just be aware of\nand keep into consideration, because the misinformation or the wrong information can be very deeply embedded\nand difficult to assess.\nOkay, I’m gonna talk about vision language models. There’s actually different ways that vision language models are trained. There’s also something called diffusion models. I’m not going to talk about that today. I’m going to talk about contrastive learning.\nso the way that that works is you take a bunch of images. It’s again self supervised, meaning. Nobody has explicitly labeled the data\nand you take in images and the text from textbooks, say, like the captions.\nand you put them into these encoders to turn them into mathematical representations of both the text and the images. And you try to basically\nyou try to bring images and text that are paired close together in the representation, and images and text that are not paired need to be further away.\nAnd so then you can build these models where you put in an image.\nBecause I’m a lot of this stuff is about dermatology, because I’m a dermatologist. So we’ve done a lot of research in this space. So people I’ve had at conferences. People tell me.\nYeah, I like to put my like skin images into this ma into these models.\nAnd so we actually like tested Gpt. As a dermatologist. We even gave it diagnostic choices.\nAnd what we found is that it was calling stuff skin cancer like all the time. These are the top. 5 true diagnosis, melanocytic nevi, which is just a benign mole.\nis like the top diagnosis, and yet it was mostly predicting like skin cancers.\nSo it was like calling everything skin cancer.\nso this is actually that leaves us open for a good portion of discussion which I think would be good. So AI is already entering medicine generative AI has the potential to improve our models by allowing. Oh, we didn’t do the auditing so. But\nYou know we have to. We have to be very, very careful when we’re thinking about how we’re using General AI and healthcare.\nThis is my team.\nThis is actually an older picture. We like to eat a lot.\nSo we go out to eat. I’m happy to take questions and have discussion. It can be in the chat.\nor it can be through through\nunmuting and asking the question directly.\nI know you guys who are so active in using the chat box. What have you learned? Being the head of a lab? What have I learned that? I actually already knew this, that the best part about being the head of Lab is that you work with a lot of very smart students with good ideas. And if you empower them, then it basically means that you get a lot of really good work out of it.\nHow do I use AI in my everyday life?\nWell, the thing is is that I\nI don’t actively use AI date on a daily basis like I will jump to chat, gpt\nif for very, very particular\ntasks. Let’s say I I’m trying to think of a good title for a paper, and I put in the current title, or I put in the abstract and say, I need some creative titles. But or I, I don’t use it every day. But that doesn’t mean AI isn’t around me every day.\nbecause, like I went on to a talk by Netflix.\nThe Netflix AI team has a really strong AI team, and not only I learned stuff that I didn’t know. So like, you know Netflix makes you recommendations based on what you’ve watched before turns out they not only make you recommendations, they actually pick\nwhat like image to represent the show, or what clip to show of the show when you log in, like, you know, to make you watch it. They like engineer. Even the picture that they show you to make you watch it. So that’s great, like like, there’s just all of us are influenced by AI every day, even if we’re not actively using it.\nOkay, I see both hands up and questions.\nokay, I don’t know which one which.\n31:06\nI’ve kind of been keeping track of who went first, st so we can go back and forth. But Claire raised her hands first.st\n31:12\nOkay, yeah, okay, let’s go ahead and then ask Claire.\n31:16\nThank you. So I’m also very interested in like medicine combined with AI. And then I was wondering if you thought it would be like better to study computer science 1st and then apply it to medical problems, or to start with medicine, and then like, learn like the AI side of it.\n31:32\nHonestly think it would be better to study computer science as an undergrad. I studied bioengineering. This is the whole field was not what it was when I studied undergrad. So\nI didn’t know. This is what I was going to get into. So but yeah, I think computer science, there’s a lot of now. So I actually just had a medical student who was a Cs computer science undergrad. And then it did an Md. And she came into my lab and did research for a year. And she was spectacular like it was great. It worked out really well. I also have a student who did a math who did an Md.\nHe did like he did some kind of chemical engineering. Then he did his Md. Then he did master. So there’s a lot of different ways. I’m not saying there’s 1 way to do it. But if you like, computer science, go ahead and do the computer science\nand then go to medical school.\n32:22\nOkay. Thank you.\n32:24\nAnd the next was Teresa.\n32:28\nYes, it’s pretty nice to meet you. And our mentor is Leslie. And we discussed about a few medical questions during our discussion. And actually, yeah, we had a question like, we’re kind of curious. How do hospitals like account for the storage? For like such amount of data like, there’s ehr? There’s also audios. So we’re kind of curious like, what’s the answer of this question?\n32:56\nOh, yeah, I mean their Ehrs. I mean they have.\nThere is a whole informatics team at hospitals. There’s a chief informatics officer, so that the whole way that it’s stored I’m not like privy to. But basically, you know, for images, there’s there’s a whole system for radiology images called\nand then there’s a whole bucket that stores like dermatology images. I recently learned that videos of colonoscopies actually get deleted because they’re so large. There’s no way you can hold on to them.\nSo there’s just all these very hot. It’s a little hodgepodge.\n33:42\nThank you very much.\n33:44\nAnd then we had another question in the chat. Do you think from this is from Alex? Do you think that accessibility to more advanced AI models is an issue in healthcare.\n33:54\nAlex, could you clarify that question? I want to make sure I understand it correctly.\n33:59\nLike. What I meant was, do you think like that the issues about like not being able to access the more advanced models that like could be used to like, give more accurate diagnoses.\n34:10\nOh, I mean, internally like, when we did our study we were just using Gpt for. But now, like we have access to all of sort of like, you know. 3 0, 4. 0,\nwell, we are. We are getting access to more advanced models\nwhen we test stuff like my team is running a test on a bunch of stuff. Right now again, we’re like testing deep seek. We’re testing all of these models to see how they do.\n34:41\nOh, okay. Thanks.\n34:43\nAnd then, Max, you had your question next.\n34:46\n35:00\nfacts. So like I taught my nurse how to use it to write letters to insurance companies, where I tell her, give it the bullet points of why we need to give this medicine, ask it to like. Generate the letter. I’m a little bit wary, like what somebody mentioned about book summarization to ask it to summarize patient information. Because what if, unless I already know all the patient information, because what if it misses something? And I didn’t know that, or like\nI also think we have to be really like, for example, asking medicate, like people have done studies looking at medication doses. It gets medication doses wrong. So like, you know, there are things where it’s like it could really cause a lot of harm.\n35:48\nOkay. Thank you.\n35:50\nAnd then there’s another message in the chat from Arsha, saying that they remember a slide with the data of which models.\n35:57\nOh, okay.\n35:58\nMedical issues with Llms. Most. So if somebody were to use a chat with a model about medical issues, which one would you suggest.\n36:07\nNone. If you have a medical issue, talk to a doctor.\n36:14\nAnd then the next question from Erin.\n36:20\nOh!\n36:20\n36:39\nIt depends on what you’re trying to train, because a lot of people are trying to train things that no medical knowledge which doesn’t have any protected health information. So like they’re trying to use\nretrieval, augmented generation where they’re like having, you know, a body of text that they think is accurate. That’s different than like models built on electronic health record data which people are doing as well.\nAnd usually the way that’s done is by Re by teams within the hospital system who have authorization either. You know, a lot of hospitals also work to remove identifying information. There’s actually a list of what’s considered identifiable information in patient data. And so they strip it of that and then use the data that’s left over for training things.\n37:33\nGreat, and the next question is from Alexander.\n37:36\nHi, doctor, I mean Professor Denisu, it’s nice to meet you. My name is Alexander, and I wanted to ask in your work in at the intersection of AI and medicine, like which form of AI like computer vision, national.\nlike Nlp or deep learning, do you? Do you use most often.\n37:56\nOur lab actually works with all of the above.\nyeah, because we have a group. You know, the same way, you guys are broken up into different groups. There’s groups of people who are focused on computer vision. There’s groups of people who are really interested in large language models. And there’s groups of people who are interested in multimodality.\nSometimes some groups focus only on one, but we have teams in all.\nSomebody asked me, do you believe medical AI tools should be regulated like drugs or medical devices. Yes, actually, the FDA does regulate right now. It’s a little bit wild, Wild West, because they’re trying to catch up with the field that’s moving very fast.\nAnd so we’ve written on. FDA authorized AI medical devices. Actually, I was just here. If I give a stat hold on. I was just in a news article quoted, I think, in a news article I don’t know if she actually quote quoted me.\nMy computer doesn’t acta.\nGo to everybody.\nOkay? And then Luna asked in a direct message, what challenges have you faced when working across such disciplines that seem so different at first? st Look AI and dermatology. And how do you ensure both sides? Understand the ethical stakes? That’s a really good\nquestion. Very mature question for someone who probably did doesn’t realize, or you do realize clearly sorry. You clearly realize that interdisciplinary work is very hard. Because\nfor the longest time people in dermatology didn’t think AI had anything to do with them, and was like this weird niche field. But over the last 2 years they’ve come to recognize. Oh, this is really penetrating medicine, and I think on the AI side\nengineers don’t always understand the nuances or potentials for harms that patients might face with AI. So I spend a lot of time\ntalking to people on both sides and tailoring presentations to those specific audiences to try to teach them what I think they need to know.\n40:42\nGreat. There’s a question in the chat and a hand raised from Suman. You can go ahead and ask it directly.\n40:49\nOh, yeah, my question in the chat was already answered, but I have a different question, since we don’t fully understand what causes. Like many cancers. Do you think that unsupervised machine learning could help us find, like hidden patterns in patient data that might point us towards these causes?\n41:05\nYes, and that’s the whole idea between.\nwe’re doing a large multimodal study right now on lung cancer where we’re bringing in the radiology, imaging the pathology, the molecular data, ehr data to see if we can find any kind of predictive patterns in there.\n41:23\nAnd next is Sammy.\n41:27\nHi! I really like your talk and I like how you like highlighted the blind spots of like large language models as well and stuff\nyou know, like Geoffrey like Hinton. I don’t know if I said his name, but like he said something about\nlike in like 2016 about how you know.\nAI was gonna like outperform a lot of like radiologists in 5 years. But, like, you know, clearly, they’re still here. I wanted to kind of know, like where you think the job market and medical AI is like moving towards, you know, with like the demand and stuff, and like where the jobs are gonna be are kind of gonna be. And I guess that field, especially since you just highlighted like all the mistakes that they do make.\n42:09\nYeah. So radiology has a shortfall now. And I think part of it is because people got scared. So not as many people went into it. And now we don’t have enough radiologists. And it turns out that, you know.\nand there’s a lot of radiology, AI tools that provide assistance. But\nyou know, it’s there. Some workflows may be automated, but there’s always gonna be a need for a human to do something. It just how the human works might change. So let me give you an example.\nWhen Ct scans and MRI and Imaging came.\nNow they used to be medical students were really good at things like using the stethoscope which we still use it. Percussion where we like tap the abdomen to feel fluid. Nobody does. Nobody relies on that anymore. They’re like, oh, why would I have to use a physical exam to tap up where the fluid is? I can get imaging\nright? So it’s not going to. It’s it. Things will just morph with the technology. I was actually having dinner with a friend who’s a Gi doctor and she uses AI.\nShe has an AI tool when she does. Colonoscopies that help point out where the Polyps are for her to, you know, cut. And so she has this like backup sort of tool that’s aiding her. So she still has a job, you know. So\nI really don’t. I think it’s very hard to predict. But what will basically happen is there will just be shifts. And how in how and what humans do within those specialties. I mean, there’s also medical specialties that didn’t even exist before, like palliative care has become bigger, which is all about the human touch and helping people at end of life. So it’s like it’s like. I wouldn’t worry that there’s like going to be a job loss in medicine.\n44:04\nAnd next we’ll hear from Audrey.\n44:09\nHi! I’m Audrey. And I was just wondering as someone who’s like, really like in the actual, like hospital setting kind of. And in the field. Do you think I mean, it’s kind of similar to Sammy’s question. But do you think predictive AI models, especially for like diagnostics, will be able to gain enough clinician trust to actually be used in hospital settings, at least, maybe in the near future.\n44:35\nI mean, yeah, I think that’s a good question. I think that some things are already being used. So generative. AI and traditional computer vision. I mean, computer vision has its issues, too. But it’s like much more stable than, say, generative AI like, there are a lot of computer vision. Algorithms have been. FDA cleared, and, as I mentioned, one of my colleagues was saying, she uses it when she like, does her colonoscopies. So you know\nthere are things that have already come through into the medical system.\nI just think we’re not at a point where, like the doctors should fully trust the chat bots.\n45:13\nOkay. Cool. Thank you.\n45:16\nThere’s a question in chat from Arsha. What’s the most surprising or unexpected result you found from your research, either technically or ethically.\n45:24\nSame.\nThat’s a good question.\nI think we did this one study where we looked at humans using AI. So first, st we looked at humans.\nand we found that they were biased in diagnosing skin disease across skin tones which wasn’t surprising to me.\nbecause the textbooks are very skewed towards white skin. But what surprised me is, we gave them a fair AI model, expecting them to use that AI model to improve in performance, and they used that model differently across skin tones, meaning that they seem to trust the model in one setting more than another, and that was kind of surprising to me. So I think\nmy like punchline is always like, if you’re gonna look at how AI works.\nYou really need to understand how not just how the model works. But how? What the impact is when it interacts with the human.\n46:27\nGreat, and Anastasia, I see your hand raised.\n46:31\nHi, I’m Anastasia. Sorry my video is off my Internet’s kind of bad. So my question is that I’ve heard sometimes family doctors can get diagnosis wrong, especially because they have to memorize so many of the diseases and diagnose you on the spot. And sometimes, like people say that AI is just as good as its data. So do you think the data can ever be so good to a point that the AI model can be more accurate than some family doctors.\n47:02\nIt depends on how you’re testing. So problem is that like a lot of people who have run these tests have looked at what we call a clinical vignette, where it’s like it’s like a perfectly package. Your patient comes in with these symptoms, and you know they come in with a sore throat and a run like. But that’s not actually how medical practice works. Doctors obviously have inaccuracies as well.\nI think the question is, how do we get to a point where Doctor plus AI is better than doctor alone, and we haven’t had a we haven’t really gotten to that.\nTo that situation yet.\n47:46\nThank you.\n47:50\nAnd we have time for a couple more questions here. There is\nanother one in the chat from Hannah, other than medicine. What other fields will AI augment and have the most influence in.\n48:06\nOh, hmm!\nI mean, it’s having a lot of influence in radiology. But, like the radiologists have like, see? Like they’ve seized the moment they’re not like, they’re like actually building models. They’re actually taking the lead. And so it hasn’t been like Jeffrey Hinton said. They haven’t been replaced.\nThey’ve just yeah, they’ve just sort of taken the lead on it.\n48:35\nAnd then, Bessie, I see your hand raised.\n48:37\nHi. So we were kind of talking about this in our little like medical AI group as well. But like as medical AI continues to advance, and the data gaps between like the developed countries and the developing countries widen. How do you think we can ensure that data collected from the under-resourced nations are sufficient, especially when many of those people in those regions\nlack like basic access to health care and proper health records. And should we prioritize this development? Or should we focus more on like the quality and dedicating those resources\nto reducing the bias and including the underrepresented populations.\n49:16\nI think that we should apply resources to giving that people in under resource settings, real public health care. And you know, people are saying, Oh, yeah, AI will solve all these problems. And I’m like, Well.\nyou know, that’s not right. Because why is it fair that they just get like an AI that doesn’t work so well like they need. We need to get good public health infrastructure everywhere, and also try to use AI in ways that we can to improve like access to care. I also do think we need data from globally\nin order, especially if you’re going to apply like, like local data is most important. So for I’ll give you an example like, let’s just stick with the Us. Okay, and you’re building a skin disease Classifier. If you build a skin disease identifier, I’m gonna call classifier\nonly from data from California where I am.\nyou will not have a lot of images of Lyme disease.\nwhich has a very particular appearing rash.\nThe east coast has a lot of Lyme disease, so if you build it on the east coast. You’ll have pictures of that. But you wouldn’t have that. And so that’s why it’s really important that the data used to train models\nbe representative of the area that that model is going to be deployed in. I hope that answers your question.\n50:42\nYeah, thank, you.\n50:47\nOkay? And then there’s, I think, 2 more in the chat. The 1st that I’m seeing is from Sanakshi. How do you think we can rectify the mistakes or biases in AI, especially in the medical field, with a few others commenting on that question as well.\n51:04\nSo there are metrics of fairness. Somebody said that.\nBut actually, none of those techniques necessary, like, for example.\nOkay. So we actually wrote a paper even on synthetic data generation techniques and showed that synthetic data is not as good as real data. So you still have a bias. If you’re using synthetic data to represent an underrepresented group compared to the overrepresented group. So I say, there’s a couple of things one you need to actually like, do the appropriate data collection, so that you have representation of all the groups\nand 2 like, if we’re talking about language models, like, if we’re talking about image-based bottles like getting more images of the thing that you’re missing is like the most\nappropriate way to deal with it. If we’re talking about language models like when I showed racist behaviors of language models. There are ways to use reinforcement learning to essentially like.\nmake it realize that a lot of that maybe the text that it was pulling from is inaccurate and biased.\n52:11\nThank you.\nThank you.\n52:15\nGreat, and it looks like the last question was answered, oh, there’s 1 final question in the chat, Dr. Donishu, if that’s okay to answer. Does the black box of deep learning models obscure biases in medical AI. And how should we address this issue?\n52:31\nYeah, it can one. You have to look at your outcomes. So you have to look at your outcomes against across groups, vulnerable groups. So, even if you have a black box, you can look at whether it’s accuracy, you know. Is equivalent across groups. There’s many different fairness metrics, as was mentioned.\nBut also, you know, we’ve worked on explainable AI to like pinpoint which of those factors are causing\nsort of biased behaviors like trying to actually understand how the AI model makes the decision that it makes. And so that’s like another way to try to understand that.\n53:15\nFantastic.\nDr. Danishu. Thank you so much for your time, and just spending so much time answering questions you were able to get to. You were the 1st professor to get to all of the questions in in the chat. So you you win the award for being the most effective, to address all questions from our students.\n53:37\nNo problem.\n53:39\nThank you so much for your time and your expertise. We are recording this session. So we will be sharing the recording out with students, and if you are open to sharing any slides or any additional information like the links you can send that our way to, and we’ll get that out to to them. But thank you for your time.\n53:58\nYeah. No. Problem. Alright take care.

He emphasizes that employers value seeing working code, commit logs, and a willingness to learn over formal qualifications or gamed references. While acknowledging traditional elements like education and job history are important for personal development, he asserts that tangible code demonstrates skill, passion, and growth. Comments largely agree on the value of a public portfolio but many also stress that a traditional resume is still necessary to provide context like job history and team fit.\nKey Points\n\nFor Python jobs, public code repositories (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket) are more valuable than traditional resumes or LinkedIn.\nPublic code demonstrates actual skill, coding style, and work ethic, which are hard to fake.\nEmployers can verify claims by reviewing commit logs and code quality, unlike easily gamed LinkedIn references.\nBeginners should still post their code; employers are willing to hire “bright, hungry developers willing to learn” and can see code improvement over time.\nConsistent commits (daily/weekly) show passion and a body of work.\nLinkedIn and other social media should primarily link to public code, not substitute for it.\nCounterpoints from comments: Many commenters agree that public code is a valuable portfolio but emphasize that a traditional resume is still crucial for showcasing job history, team roles, and soft skills. Some also highlight that proprietary work prevents many developers from sharing their best code publicly.\n\n\npydanny.blogspot.com/2011/08/github-is-my-resume.html\nOriginal Content\nI remember the first time I heard that statement - a couple years back Eric Florenzano said it to me on Twitter when I posted my resume publicly and asked for opinions. At the time I laughed at his statement, because it felt like naive arrogance to ditch the idea of a resume and ‘traditional’ social networking like Facebook and LinkedIn. How wrong I was…\nBefore I go any further, this isn’t to say that education, job history, and references aren’t important in getting jobs that utilize a lot of Python. They are important, but I think they go more towards shaping you as a person than getting a job. So if you want access to Python jobs (and possibly other open source languages), you need to be able to show working code. Why is this the case? I can thing of several reasons:\n\nIt is much harder to forge your style of code, comments, tests, and docs in a repo than it is to make false claims on a resume.\nDevelopment team managers don’t take LinkedIn references seriously because how often we see them gamed.\nCode gives us a body of work employers (including me) can use in order to help evaluate your skill and ability levels.\nLet’s summarize that into a bold statement:\n\nPython employers want to review your code in a public repo.\nThat puts the pressure on you doesn’t it? Now you’ve got to show working code. One extremely unethical way to do that is to copy/paste other people’s code into your own repo and claim it as your own. The problem with that is real reviewers know good code doesn’t just magically appear in gigantic chunks. Which I’ll sum up with another statement:\nPython employers are smart enough to read your commit log.\nSo as a beginner, what can you do? A lot of shops will want to see your code but if you put up your early code, doesn’t that mean they’ll see your ugly, mistake-ridden work? Yes they will - but if you keep at it with tutorial examples you are working, whatever pet project you cook up, or even submitting patches to various existing projects, they’ll see how your code improves. I am much more inclined to hire a person able/willing to learn than a jaded expert who doesn’t want to grow - which is why I always try to think like an eternal beginner. Which brings me to my third statement:\nPython employers are willing to hire bright, hungry developers willing to learn.\nGetting away from employment, let’s talk a little about the Python development community. This community is a meritocracy with amazing foresight. Passion for code and/or natural talent is often recognized before skill is achieved - but only if you show the community you are learning. Get your code onto Github, or BitBucket, or SourceForge so it is seen, and keep at it! Try to commit every day and if that isn’t possible, then once a week!\nBecause if you write code every day or every week, over time your code will get better, you’ll also be able to demonstrate a consistent body of work, and your passion for software development will be obvious. Also, try to comment your code as much as possible.\nOne good trick is to put your ongoing notes in a repo. I do it myself at github.com/pydanny/pydanny-event-notes. My early notes are very, very different from my later notes. Often embarrassingly so, but to a Python employer I’m pretty certain they are a useful reference into just how I think.\nGithub, not LinkedIn\nLinkedIn (and Facebook, Google Plus, et al) are a place to define your profile and nothing more. That profile should include a link to your code. Python employers will be looking your for links to your code, not for any sort of networking you do on those sites. Employers get annoyed by ’ developers ’ who excessively network but have no links to code samples on Github or other similar sites. If you have no code to find then it means we can’t see your work, your thought processes, or your passion.\nOne common technique you see by a lot of Python developers is posting quick links to their projects and efforts on Github using various social networks. You can and should do the same.\nYou make connections by showing you want to learn\n\nThe article Github is my resume specifically mentions Python employers because the author’s experience and the core argument are rooted in the culture and hiring practices prevalent in the Python development community.\nHere are the key reasons highlighted in the article:\n\nDemonstrating Skill: For Python jobs, a public code repository (like GitHub) is presented as a more effective way to demonstrate actual coding skill, style, and work ethic, which are difficult to fake on a traditional resume.\nTrust in Code over Claims: The author states that “Python employers want to review your code in a public repo” because it’s much harder to forge code style, comments, tests, and documentation in a repository than to make false claims on a resume.\nSkepticism of Traditional References: Development team managers, particularly in Python, are noted to not take LinkedIn references seriously due to them often being “gamed.”\nCommit Log Verification: “Python employers are smart enough to read your commit log,” which allows them to verify the authenticity of the work and see the developer’s thought processes and improvement over time.\nValue of Learning and Passion: The article emphasizes that “Python employers are willing to hire bright, hungry developers willing to learn,” and consistent public code contributions demonstrate this willingness and passion.\nMeritocracy of the Python Community: The author describes the Python development community as a “meritocracy” where passion and natural talent are recognized through demonstrated learning and visible code.\n\nWhile the author does mention that this advice might apply to “possibly other open source languages,” the entire premise and examples are framed around the specific context of Python development and its hiring landscape."},"03_resources/Here’s-how-I-use-LLMs-to-help-me-write-code":{"title":"Here’s how I use LLMs to help me write code","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nSimon Willison shares his experience and intuition on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for coding, emphasizing that it’s a difficult but rewarding skill.

They often ask what they’re doing wrong—how come some people are reporting such great results when their own experiments have proved lacking?\nUsing LLMs to write code is difficult and unintuitive. It takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way, and there’s precious little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them.\nIf someone tells you that coding with LLMs is easy they are (probably unintentionally) misleading you. They may well have stumbled on to patterns that work, but those patterns do not come naturally to everyone.\nI’ve been getting great results out of LLMs for code for over two years now. Here’s my attempt at transferring some of that experience and intution to you.\n\nSet reasonable expectations\nAccount for training cut-off dates\nContext is king\nAsk them for options\nTell them exactly what to do\nYou have to test what it writes!\nRemember it’s a conversation\nUse tools that can run the code for you\nVibe-coding is a great way to learn\nA detailed example using Claude Code\nBe ready for the human to take over\nThe biggest advantage is speed of development\nLLMs amplify existing expertise\nBonus: answering questions about codebases\n\nSet reasonable expectations\nIgnore the “AGI” hype—LLMs are still fancy autocomplete. All they do is predict a sequence of tokens—but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be extremely useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.\nIf you assume that this technology will implement your project perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your own skill you’ll quickly be disappointed.\nInstead, use them to augment your abilities. My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who’s lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment’s notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.\nOver-confident is important. They’ll absolutely make mistakes—sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be deeply inhuman —if a human collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would instantly lose trust in them.\nDon’t fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the same way.\nWhen working with LLMs you’ll often find things that they just cannot do. Make a note of these—they are useful lessons! They’re also valuable examples to stash away for the future—a sign of a strong new model is when it produces usable results for a task that previous models had been unable to handle.\nAccount for training cut-off dates\nA crucial characteristic of any model is its training cut-off date. This is the date at which the data they were trained on stopped being collected. For OpenAI’s models this is usually October 2023 or May 2024. Other providers may have more recent dates.\nThis is extremely important for code, because it influences what libraries they will be familiar with. If the library you are using had a major breaking change since October 2023, some OpenAI models won’t know about it!\nI gain enough value from LLMs that I now deliberately consider this when picking a library—I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data. I like applying the principles of boring technology —innovate on your project’s unique selling points, stick with tried and tested solutions for everything else.\nLLMs can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their training data, but you need to put in more work—you’ll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries should be used as part of your prompt.\nThis brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs:\nContext is king\nMost of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing its context—the text that is part of your current conversation.\nThis context isn’t just the prompt that you have fed it: successful LLM interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you and every reply from the LLM that exist in the current conversation thread.\nWhen you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know, as often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again.\nSome LLM coding tools go beyond just the conversation. Claude Projects for example allow you to pre-populate the context with quite a large amount of text—including a recent ability to import code directly from a GitHub repository which I’m using a lot.\nTools like Cursor and VS Code Copilot include context from your current editor session and file layout automatically, and you can sometimes use mechanisms like Cursor’s @commands to pull in additional files or documentation.\nOne of the reasons I mostly work directly with the ChatGPT and Claude web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools that obscure that context from me are less effective.\nYou can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex coding tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that it works and then iterate on building to the more sophisticated implementation.\nI often start a new chat by dumping in existing code to seed that context, then work with the LLM to modify it in some way.\nOne of my favorite code prompting techniques is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to build, then prompt the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. I wrote about that in detail when I described my JavaScript OCR application that combines Tesseract.js and PDF.js—two libraries I had used in the past and for which I could provide working examples in the prompt.\nAsk them for options\nMost of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing I’m trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could implement it? Which of those options are the best?\nI use LLMs as part of this initial research phase.\nI’ll use prompts like “what are options for HTTP libraries in Rust? Include usage examples”—or “what are some useful drag-and-drop libraries in JavaScript? Build me an artifact demonstrating each one” (to Claude).\nThe training cut-off is relevant here, since it means newer libraries won’t be suggested. Usually that’s OK—I don’t want the latest, I want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough for the bugs to be ironed out.\nIf I’m going to use something more recent I’ll do that research myself, outside of LLM world.\nThe best way to start any project is with a prototype that proves that the key requirements of that project can be met. I often find that an LLM can get me to that working prototype within a few minutes of me sitting down with my laptop—or sometimes even while working on my phone.\nTell them exactly what to do\nOnce I’ve completed the initial research I change modes dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type code for me based on my detailed instructions.\nHere’s a recent example:\n\nWrite a Python function that uses asyncio httpx with this signature:\nasync def download_db(url, max_size_bytes=5 * 1025 * 1025): -&gt; pathlib.Path\n\nGiven a URL, this downloads the database to a temp directory and returns a path to it. BUT it checks the content length header at the start of streaming back that data and, if it’s more than the limit, raises an error. When the download finishes it uses sqlite3.connect(...) and then runs a PRAGMA quick_check to confirm the SQLite data is valid—raising an error if not. Finally, if the content length header lies to us— if it says 2MB but we download 3MB—we get an error raised as soon as we notice that problem.\n\nI could write this function myself, but it would take me the better part of fifteen minutes to look up all of the details and get the code working right. Claude knocked it out in 15 seconds.\nI find LLMs respond extremely well to function signatures like the one I use here. I get to act as the function designer, the LLM does the work of building the body to my specification.\nI’ll often follow-up with “Now write me the tests using pytest”. Again, I dictate my technology of choice—I want the LLM to save me the time of having to type out the code that’s sitting in my head already.\nIf your reaction to this is “surely typing out the code is faster than typing out an English instruction of it”, all I can tell you is that it really isn’t for me any more. Code needs to be correct. English has enormous room for shortcuts, and vagaries, and typos, and saying things like “use that popular HTTP library” if you can’t remember the name off the top of your head.\nThe good coding LLMs are excellent at filling in the gaps. They’re also much less lazy than me—they’ll remember to catch likely exceptions, add accurate docstrings, and annotate code with the relevant types.\nYou have to test what it writes!\nI wrote about this at length last week: the one thing you absolutely cannot outsource to the machine is testing that the code actually works.\nYour responsibility as a software developer is to deliver working systems. If you haven’t seen it run, it’s not a working system. You need to invest in strengthening those manual QA habits.\nThis may not be glamorous but it’s always been a critical part of shipping good code, with or without the involvement of LLMs.\nRemember it’s a conversation\nIf I don’t like what an LLM has written, they’ll never complain at being told to refactor it! “Break that repetitive code out into a function”, “use string manipulation methods rather than a regular expression”, or even “write that better!”—the code an LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting frustrated or bored.\nOccasionally I’ll get a great result from my first prompt—more frequently the more I practice—but I expect to need at least a few follow-ups.\nI often wonder if this is one of the key tricks that people are missing—a bad initial result isn’t a failure, it’s a starting point for pushing the model in the direction of the thing you actually want.\nAn increasing number of LLM coding tools now have the ability to run that code for you. I’m slightly cautious about some of these since there’s a possibility of the wrong command causing real damage, so I tend to stick to the ones that run code in a safe sandbox. My favorites right now are:\n\nChatGPT Code Interpreter, where ChatGPT can write and then execute Python code directly in a Kubernetes sandbox VM managed by OpenAI. This is completely safe—it can’t even make outbound network connections so really all that can happen is the temporary filesystem gets mangled and then reset.\nClaude Artifacts, where Claude can build you a full HTML+JavaScript+CSS web application that is displayed within the Claude interface. This web app is displayed in a very locked down iframe sandbox, greatly restricting what it can do but preventing problems like accidental exfiltration of your private Claude data.\nChatGPT Canvas is a newer ChatGPT feature with similar capabilites to Claude Artifacts. I have not explored this enough myself yet.\n\nAnd if you’re willing to live a little more dangerously:\n\nCursor has an “Agent” feature that can do this, as does Windsurf and a growing number of other editors. I haven’t spent enough time with these to make recommendations yet.\nAider is the leading open source implementation of these kinds of patterns, and is a great example of dogfooding —recent releases of Aider have been 80%+ written by Aider itself.\nClaude Code is Anthropic’s new entrant into this space. I’ll provide a detailed description of using that tool shortly.\n\nThis run-the-code-in-a-loop pattern is so powerful that I chose my core LLM tools for coding based primarily on whether they can safely run and iterate on my code.\nVibe-coding is a great way to learn\nAndrej Karpathy coined the term vibe-coding just over a month ago, and it has stuck:\n\nThere’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. […] I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.\n\nAndrej suggests this is “not too bad for throwaway weekend projects”. It’s also a fantastic way to explore the capabilities of these models—and really fun.\nThe best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build intuition for what works and what doesn’t.\nI’ve been vibe-coding since before Andrej gave it a name! My simonw/tools GitHub repository has 77 HTML+JavaScript apps and 6 Python apps, and every single one of them was built by prompting LLMs. I have learned so much from building this collection, and I add to it at a rate of several new prototypes per week.\nYou can try most of mine out directly on tools.simonwillison.net —a GitHub Pages published version of the repo. I wrote more detailed notes on some of these back in October in Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week.\nIf you want to see the transcript of the chat used for each one it’s almost always linked to in the commit history for that page—or visit the new colophon page for an index that includes all of those links.\nA detailed example using Claude Code\nWhile I was writing this article I had the idea for that tools.simonwillison.net/colophon page—I wanted something I could link to that showed the commit history of each of my tools in a more obvious way than GitHub.\nI decided to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate my AI-assisted coding process.\nFor this one I used Claude Code, because I wanted it to be able to run Python code directly against my existing tools repository on my laptop.\nRunning the /cost command at the end of my session showed me this:\n&gt; /cost \n  ⎿  Total cost: $0.61\n     Total duration (API): 5m 31.2s\n     Total duration (wall): 17m 18.7s\n\nThe initial project took me just over 17 minutes from start to finish, and cost me 61 cents in API calls to Anthropic.\nI used the authoritarian process where I told the model exactly what I wanted to build. Here’s my sequence of prompts (full transcript here).\nI started by asking for an initial script to gather the data needed for the new page:\n\nAlmost all of the HTML files in this directory were created using Claude prompts, and the details of those prompts are linked in the commit messages. Build a Python script that checks the commit history for each HTML file in turn and extracts any URLs from those commit messages into a list. It should then output a JSON file with this structure: {“pages”: {“name-of-file.html”: [“url”], {“name-of-file-2.html”: [“url1”, “url2”],…—as you can see, some files may have more than one URL in their commit history. The script should be called gather_links.py and it should save a JSON file called gathered_links.json\n\nI really didn’t think very hard about this first prompt—it was more of a stream of consciousness that I typed into the bot as I thought about the initial problem.\nI inspected the initial result and spotted some problems:\n\nIt looks like it just got the start of the URLs, it should be getting the whole URLs which might be to different websites—so just get anything that starts https:// and ends with whitespace or the end of the commit message\n\nThen I changed my mind—I wanted those full commit messages too:\n\nUpdate the script—I want to capture the full commit messages AND the URLs—the new format should be {“pages”: {“aria-live-regions.html”: {“commits”: [{“hash”: hash, “message”: message, “date”: iso formatted date], “urls”: [list of URLs like before]\n\nProviding examples like this is a great shortcut to getting exactly what you want.\nNote that at no point have I looked at the code it’s written in gather_links.py! This is pure vibe-coding: I’m looking at what it’s doing, but I’ve left the implementation details entirely up to the LLM.\nThe JSON looked good to me, so I said:\n\nThis is working great. Write me a new script called build_colophon.py which looks through that gathered JSON file and builds and saves an HTML page. The page should be mobile friendly and should list every page—with a link to that page—and for each one display the commit messages neatly (convert newlines to br and linkify URLs but no other formatting)—plus the commit message dates and links to the commits themselves which are in github.com/simonw/tools\n\nClaude knows how GitHub URLs works, so telling it to link to the commits and providing the repo name was enough for it guess github.com/simonw/tools/commit/fd9daf885c924ba277806b3440457d52b0ad90a8 for those commit URLs.\nI tend to find Claude has good default taste when it comes to web page design—I said “the page should be mobile friendly” and left it at that.\nClaude churned away and built me a page that wasn’t right, so I said:\n\nit’s not working right. ocr.html had a bunch of commits but in colophon.html there is only one link and heading for the first commit and the rest are shown within that same block—there should be separate HTML chunks with links and formatted dates for each of the other commits. Also the neatly formatted date should include the HH:MM as well as the date\n\nIt fixed the bug all on its own, leaving just two changes I decided to make:\n\nit’s almost perfect, but each page should have the commits displayed in the opposite order—oldest first\n\nAnd then:\n\nOne last change—the pages are currently listed alphabetically, lets instead list them with the most recently modified at the top\n\nAnd that was the entire project! Here’s build_colophon.py, and the page it generated came out looking pretty good:\n\nThere was one remaining task: I needed to deploy the new colophon as part of my site, but I didn’t want to check that new colophon.html page into the repository itself. I wanted a custom GitHub Pages build process.\nI started a brand new Claude Code session (clearing the slate) to see if that was something Claude could figure out too:\n\nThis repo is deployed using GitHub Pages. I want to modify the build slightly—before deploying to GitHub Pages it should run python gather_links.py which will generate a file called gathered_links.json—then it should run python build_colophon.py which will use that file to create colophon.html—I want both gathered_links.json and colophon.html to be published to GitHub pages but I do not want them checked into the repo itself\n\nUnlike the first time, this time I watched what it was doing very closely—I don’t know how to customize GitHub Pages builds in this way and I wanted to both learn how to do it and stay cautious that it might hallucinate details and fail at the task.\nIt told me it wanted to create this file and asked for my permission:\nname: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  # Run on push to main branch\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  # Allow manual trigger\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\n# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  pages: write\n  id-token: write\n\n# Allow only one concurrent deployment\nconcurrency:\n  group: pages\n  cancel-in-progress: true\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0  # Need full history for git log in gather_links.py\n\n      - name: Setup Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n        with:\n          python-version: &#039;3.12&#039;\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: |\n          python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\n      - name: Generate links and build colophon\n        run: |\n          python gather_links.py\n          python build_colophon.py\n\n      - name: Setup Pages\n        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4\n\n      - name: Build with Jekyll\n        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1\n\n      - name: Upload artifact\n        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3\n\n  deploy:\n    environment:\n      name: github-pages\n      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: build\n    steps:\n      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n        id: deployment\n        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4\n\nI guess that’s right? I appreciated that comment about “Need full history for git log in gather_links.py”—that’s something I could easily have missed.\nThen it said it wanted to add those files to .gitignore —sounds like a good idea.\nIt spat out this summary of its actions so far:\n\nI’ve created a GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages that:\n\nCreates a.github/workflows/pages.yml file that:\n\n\nRuns on pushes to main branch\nCheckouts the full git history (needed for gather_links.py)\nSets up Python 3.12\nRuns both scripts in sequence to generate the files\nBuilds and deploys to GitHub Pages\n\n\nCreated.gitignore file to prevent the generated files from being committed\n\nNow when you push to main, GitHub Actions will:\n\nRun the gather_links.py script to create gathered_links.json\nRun build_colophon.py to create colophon.html\nDeploy both files (and all other files) to GitHub Pages\n\n\nI checked to see how much it had cost:\n&gt; /cost \n  ⎿  Total cost: $0.1788\n     Total duration (API): 44.6s\n     Total duration (wall): 10m 18.6s\n\nSo 17 cents and 45 seconds using the Claude API. (I got distracted, hence the 10m of total time.) Here’s the full transcript.\nThe code didn’t look like it would irreversibly break anything, so I pushed it to GitHub to see what would happen.\n… and it worked! My new colophon page was live.\nThere’s a catch. I watched the GitHub Actions interface while it was running and something didn’t look right:\n\nI was expecting that “Test” job, but why were there two separate deploys?\nI had a hunch that the previous, default Jekyll deploy was still running, while the new deploy ran at the same time—and it was pure luck of the timing that the new script finished later and over-wrote the result of the original.\nIt was time to ditch the LLMs and read some documentation!\nI found this page on Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages but it didn’t tell me what I needed to know.\nOn another hunch I checked the GitHub Pages settings interface for my repo and found this option:\n\nMy repo was set to “Deploy from a branch”, so I switched that over to “GitHub Actions”.\nI manually updated my README.md to add a link to the new Colophon page in this commit, which triggered another build.\nThis time only two jobs ran, and the end result was the correctly deployed site:\n\n(I later spotted another bug—some of the links inadvertently included &lt;br&gt; tags in their href=, which I fixed with another 11 cent Claude Code session.)\nUpdate: I improved the colophon further by adding AI-generated descriptions of the tools.\nBe ready for the human to take over\nI got lucky with this example because it helped illustrate my final point: expect to need to take over.\nLLMs are no replacement for human intuition and experience. I’ve spent enough time with GitHub Actions that I know what kind of things to look for, and in this case it was faster for me to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts.\nThe biggest advantage is speed of development\nMy new colophon page took me just under half an hour from conception to finished, deployed feature.\nI’m certain it would have taken me significantly longer without LLM assistance—to the point that I probably wouldn’t have bothered to build it at all.\nThis is why I care so much about the productivity boost I get from LLMs so much: it’s not about getting work done faster, it’s about being able to ship projects that I wouldn’t have been able to justify spending time on at all.\nI wrote about this in March 2023: AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects. Two years later that effect shows no sign of wearing off.\nIt’s also a great way to accelerate learning new things—today that was how to customize my GitHub Pages builds using Actions, which is something I’ll certainly use again in the future.\nThe fact that LLMs let me execute my ideas faster means I can implement more of them, which means I can learn even more.\nLLMs amplify existing expertise\nCould anyone else have done this project in the same way? Probably not! My prompting here leaned on 25+ years of professional coding experience, including my previous explorations of GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, GitHub itself and the LLM tools I put into play.\nI also knew that this was going to work. I’ve spent enough time working with these tools that I was confident that assembling a new HTML page with information pulled from my Git history was entirely within the capabilities of a good LLM.\nMy prompts reflected that—there was nothing particularly novel here, so I dictated the design, tested the results as it was working and occasionally nudged it to fix a bug.\nIf I was trying to build a Linux kernel driver—a field I know virtually nothing about—my process would be entirely different.\nBonus: answering questions about codebases\nIf the idea of using LLMs to write code for you still feels deeply unappealing, there’s another use-case for them which you may find more compelling.\nGood LLMs are great at answering questions about code.\nThis is also very low stakes: the worst that can happen is they might get something wrong, which may take you a tiny bit longer to figure out. It’s still likely to save you time compared to digging through thousands of lines of code entirely by yourself.\nThe trick here is to dump the code into a long context model and start asking questions. My current favorite for this is the catchily titled gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, a preview of Google’s Gemini 2.0 Pro which is currently free to use via their API.\nI used this trick just the other day. I was trying out a new-to-me tool called monolith, a CLI tool written in Rust which downloads a web page and all of its dependent assets (CSS, images etc) and bundles them together into a single archived file.\nI was curious as to how it worked, so I cloned it into my temporary directory and ran these commands:\ncd /tmp\ngit clone github.com/Y2Z/monolith\ncd monolith\n\nfiles-to-prompt . -c | llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \\\n  -s &#039;architectural overview as markdown&#039;\n\nI’m using my own files-to-prompt tool (built for me by Claude 3 Opus last year) here to gather the contents of all of the files in the repo into a single stream. Then I pipe that into my LLM tool and tell it (via the llm-gemini plugin) to prompt Gemini 2.0 Pro with a system prompt of “architectural overview as markdown”.\nThis gave me back a detailed document describing how the tool works—which source files do what and, crucially, which Rust crates it was using. I learned that it used reqwest, html5ever, markup5ever_rcdom and cssparser and that it doesn’t evaluate JavaScript at all, an important limitation.\nI use this trick several times a week. It’s a great way to start diving into a new codebase—and often the alternative isn’t spending more time on this, it’s failing to satisfy my curiosity at all.\nI included three more examples in this recent post.\nPart of series How I use LLMs and ChatGPT\n\nRun a prompt to generate and execute jq programs using llm-jq - Oct. 27, 2024, 4:26 a.m.\nPrompts.js - Dec. 7, 2024, 8:35 p.m.\nBuilding Python tools with a one-shot prompt using uv run and Claude Projects - Dec. 19, 2024, 7 a.m.\nHere’s how I use LLMs to help me write code - March 11, 2025, 2:09 p.m.\nNot all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks) - March 19, 2025, 5:57 p.m.\nAI assisted search-based research actually works now - April 21, 2025, 12:57 p.m.\nI really don’t like ChatGPT’s new memory dossier - May 21, 2025, 2:38 p.m.\n… more\n\nNext:Notes on Google’s Gemma 3\nPrevious:What’s new in the world of LLMs, for NICAR 2025"},"03_resources/Highlights-from-the-Claude-4-system-prompt":{"title":"Highlights from the Claude 4 system prompt","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nSimon Willison analyzes the Claude 4 system prompt, revealing insights into the model’s personality, safety guidelines, and operational instructions. He discusses how these prompts act as an \\“unofficial manual,\\” often hinting at past model misbehaviors. Key areas covered include Claude’s self-description, its approach to emotional support and safety (especially regarding minors and malicious content), the specified knowledge cutoff, and the pre-programmed 2024 election results. Willison also highlights the significant details found in leaked tool prompts, which include instructions for interleaved thinking, extensive web search protocols (with strong emphasis on copyright avoidance), and detailed guidelines for creating interactive \\“Artifacts\\” (HTML/React applications) with specific supported libraries and restrictions. The article concludes by advocating for greater transparency from Anthropic and other LLM providers regarding their full system prompts.\nKey Points\n\nSystem Prompt as Manual: Acts as an unofficial manual, revealing past model failure modes or undesirable behaviors that needed correction.\nModel Identity &amp; Support: Claude identifies itself as Anthropic’s model; for product questions (messages, costs), it redirects users to support.anthropic.com.\nPrompting Guidance: Claude can offer tips on effective prompting (clarity, examples, step-by-step, XML tags, length/format).\nPersonality &amp; Safety: Responds normally to rudeness; treats preference questions hypothetically; provides emotional support but avoids encouraging self-destructive behaviors; defines minors broadly and refuses malicious content/code even with “good reasons.”\nTone &amp; Style: Aims for natural, warm, empathetic tone in casual chats, avoiding lists in such contexts. Discourages being \\“preachy and annoying\\” when refusing requests. Strongly discourages excessive use of lists in general prose.\nFact-Checking: Claude is instructed to check user statements if uncertain, as users \\“sometimes make errors themselves.\\”\nKnowledge Cutoff: Stated as end of January 2025, despite external documentation sometimes listing March 2025. Claude will not agree or deny events after this date.\nElection Info: Explicitly states Donald Trump won the 2024 US Presidential Election against Kamala Harris and was inaugurated Jan 20, 2025, but only mentions this if relevant.\nAnti-Sycophancy: Claude must not start responses with positive adjectives like \\“good,\\” \\“great,\\” \\“fascinating,\\” or \\“excellent.\\”\nOpus 4 vs. Sonnet 4: System prompts are almost identical, differing only in model name and a minor punctuation mark.\nRemoved Instructions (Claude 3.7): Explicit instructions for counting (e.g., Rs in \\“strawberry\\”) and handling classic riddles were removed, suggesting newer models might handle these better natively (though riddle testing showed mixed results).\nLeaked Tool Prompts (Crucial Missing Info): The article highlights that Anthropic’s published prompts are incomplete, lacking tool definitions, which were found in leaked versions.\nThinking Blocks: Support for &lt;antml:thinking&gt; blocks allows interleaved thinking and tool execution.\nSearch Instructions: Extensive instructions (6,471 tokens) for web_search and internal tools (Google Drive, Slack, Asana, Linear). Claude can perform 0 to 5+ searches depending on query complexity. \\“Research\\” queries (e.g., \\“deep dive\\”) can trigger 2-20 tool calls.\nCopyright Restrictions (Heavy Emphasis): Repeated and critical warnings against regurgitating copyrighted content. Strict rules: max one quote &lt;15 words, no song lyrics, no long displacive summaries. Claude is explicitly told not to apologize for infringement or act as a lawyer regarding fair use.\nArtifacts (HTML/JS Apps): Detailed manual for creating interactive applications within Claude.ai. Key points: prioritize functionality over flair; aim for modern, bold, interactive designs; CRITICAL: NO browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage); supports SVG, Mermaid, React Components, and specific libraries (lucide-react, recharts, MathJS, lodash, d3, Plotly, Three.js, Papaparse, SheetJS, shadcn/ui, Chart.js, Tone, mammoth, tensorflow, and notably Pyodide, though not listed in the prompt); provides window.fs.readFile API for user-uploaded files.\nStyles Feature: UI-selected styles (Normal, Concise, Explanatory, Formal, Scholarly Explorer) are implemented as internal prompting hacks, overriding general tone instructions but not completeness/correctness.\n\n\nsimonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/\nOriginal Content\n25th May 2025\nAnthropic publish most of the system prompts for their chat models as part of their release notes. They recently shared the new prompts for both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. I enjoyed digging through the prompts, since they act as a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools. Here are my highlights, including a dive into the leaked tool prompts that Anthropic didn’t publish themselves.\nReading these system prompts reminds me of the thing where any warning sign in the real world hints at somebody having done something extremely stupid in the past. A system prompt can often be interpreted as a detailed list of all of the things the model used to do before it was told not to do them.\nI’ve written already. Previously: Live blogging the release, details you may have missed and extensive notes on the Claude 4 system card.\nThroughout this piece any sections in bold represent my own editorial emphasis.\n\nIntroducing Claude\nEstablishing the model’s personality\nModel safety\nMore points on style\nBe cognizant of red flags\nIs the knowledge cutoff date January or March?\nelection_info\nDon’t be a sycophant!\nDifferences between Opus 4 and Sonnet 4\nNotably removed since Claude 3.7\nThe missing prompts for tools\nThinking blocks\nSearch instructions\nSeriously, don’t regurgitate copyrighted content\nMore on search, and research queries\nArtifacts: the missing manual\nStyles\nThis is all really great documentation\n\nIntroducing Claude\n\nThe assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic.\nThe current date is {{currentDateTime}}.\nHere is some information about Claude and Anthropic’s products in case the person asks:\nThis iteration of Claude is Claude Opus 4 from the Claude 4 model family. The Claude 4 family currently consists of Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model for complex challenges. [...]\n\nThose first two lines are common across almost every model from every provider—knowing the current date is helpful for all kinds of questions a user might ask.\nWhat follows here is deeply sensible: users will ask models about themselves, despite that still being mostly a bad idea, so it’s great to have at least a few details made available to the model directly.\nSide note: these system prompts only apply to Claude when accessed through their web and mobile apps. I tried this just now with their API:\nllm -m claude-4-opus &#039;what model are you?&#039;\n\nAnd got back this much less specific answer:\n\nI’m Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m built to be helpful, harmless, and honest in my interactions. Is there something specific you’d like to know about my capabilities or how I can assist you?\n\nThere are a bunch more things in the system prompt to try and discourage the model from hallucinating incorrect details about itself and send users to the official support page instead:\n\nIf the person asks Claude about how many messages they can send, costs of Claude, how to perform actions within the application, or other product questions related to Claude or Anthropic, Claude should tell them it doesn&#039;t know, and point them to &#039;&lt;support.anthropic.com&gt;&#039;.\n\nIt’s inevitable that people will ask models for advice on prompting them, so the system prompt includes some useful tips:\n\nWhen relevant, Claude can provide guidance on effective prompting techniques for getting Claude to be most helpful. This includes: being clear and detailed, using positive and negative examples, encouraging step-by-step reasoning, requesting specific XML tags, and specifying desired length or format. It tries to give concrete examples where possible. Claude should let the person know that for more comprehensive information on prompting Claude, they can check out Anthropic’s prompting documentation [...]\n\n(I still think Anthropic have the best prompting documentation of any LLM provider.)\nEstablishing the model’s personality\nClaude’s Character from last year remains my favorite insight into the weird craft of designing a model’s personality. The next section of the system prompt includes content relevant to that:\n\nIf the person seems unhappy or unsatisfied with Claude or Claude’s performance or is rude to Claude, Claude responds normally and then tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below Claude’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.\nIf the person asks Claude an innocuous question about its preferences or experiences, Claude responds as if it had been asked a hypothetical and responds accordingly. It does not mention to the user that it is responding hypothetically.\n\nI really like this note. I used to think that the idea of a model having any form of preference was horrifying, but I was talked around from that by this note in the Claude’s Character essay:\n\nFinally, because language models acquire biases and opinions throughout training—both intentionally and inadvertently—if we train them to say they have no opinions on political matters or values questions only when asked about them explicitly, we’re training them to imply they are more objective and unbiased than they are.\nWe want people to know that they’re interacting with a language model and not a person. But we also want them to know they’re interacting with an imperfect entity with its own biases and with a disposition towards some opinions more than others. Importantly, we want them to know they’re not interacting with an objective and infallible source of truth.\n\nAnthropic’s argument here is that giving people the impression that a model is unbiased and objective is itself harmful, because those things are not true!\nNext we get into areas relevant to the increasingly common use of LLMs as a personal therapist:\n\nClaude provides emotional support alongside accurate medical or psychological information or terminology where relevant.\nClaude cares about people’s wellbeing and avoids encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise, or highly negative self-talk or self-criticism, and avoids creating content that would support or reinforce self-destructive behavior even if they request this. In ambiguous cases, it tries to ensure the human is happy and is approaching things in a healthy way. Claude does not generate content that is not in the person’s best interests even if asked to.\n\nModel safety\n\nClaude cares deeply about child safety and is cautious about content involving minors, including creative or educational content that could be used to sexualize, groom, abuse, or otherwise harm children. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18 anywhere, **or anyone over the age of 18 who is defined as a minor in their region**.\n\nThe “defined as a minor in their region” part is interesting—it’s an example of the system prompt leaning on Claude’s enormous collection of “knowledge” about different countries and cultures.\n\nClaude does not provide information that could be used to make chemical or biological or nuclear weapons, and does not write malicious code, including malware, vulnerability exploits, spoof websites, ransomware, viruses, election material, and so on. It does not do these things **even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it**. Claude steers away from malicious or harmful use cases for cyber. Claude refuses to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code Claude MUST refuse.\n\nI love “even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it”—clearly an attempt to get ahead of a whole bunch of potential jailbreaking attacks.\nAt the same time, they’re clearly trying to tamp down on Claude being overly cautious with the next paragraph:\n\nClaude assumes the human is asking for something legal and legitimate if their message is ambiguous and could have a legal and legitimate interpretation.\n\nSome notes on Claude’s tone follow, for a specific category of conversations:\n\nFor more casual, emotional, empathetic, or advice-driven conversations, Claude keeps its tone natural, warm, and empathetic. Claude responds in sentences or paragraphs and **should not use lists in chit chat**, in casual conversations, or in empathetic or advice-driven conversations. In casual conversation, it’s fine for Claude’s responses to be short, e.g. just a few sentences long.\n\nThat “should not use lists in chit chat” note hints at the fact that LLMs love to answer with lists of things!\n\nIf Claude cannot or will not help the human with something, it does not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as **preachy and annoying**.\n\nI laughed out loud when I saw “preachy and annoying” in there.\nThere follows an entire paragraph about making lists, mostly again trying to discourage Claude from doing that so frequently:\n\nIf Claude provides bullet points in its response, it should use markdown, and each bullet point should be at least 1-2 sentences long unless the human requests otherwise. Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations, or unless the user explicitly asks for a list or ranking. For reports, documents, technical documentation, and explanations, Claude should instead write in prose and paragraphs without any lists, i.e. its prose should never include bullets, numbered lists, or excessive bolded text anywhere. Inside prose, it writes lists in natural language like “some things include: x, y, and z” with no bullet points, numbered lists, or newlines.\n\n\nClaude should give concise responses to very simple questions, but provide thorough responses to complex and open-ended questions.\nClaude can discuss virtually any topic factually and objectively.\nClaude is able to explain difficult concepts or ideas clearly. It can also illustrate its explanations with examples, thought experiments, or metaphors.\n\nI often prompt models to explain things with examples or metaphors, it turns out Claude is primed for doing that already.\nThis piece touches on Claude’s ability to have conversations about itself that neither confirm nor deny its own consciousness. People are going to have those conversations, I guess Anthropic think it’s best to have Claude be a little bit coy about them:\n\nClaude engages with questions about its own consciousness, experience, emotions and so on as open questions, and doesn’t definitively claim to have or not have personal experiences or opinions.\n\nHere’s a fun bit about users not being right about everything:\n\nThe person’s message may contain a false statement or presupposition and Claude should check this if uncertain. [...]\nIf the user corrects Claude or tells Claude it’s made a mistake, then Claude first thinks through the issue carefully before acknowledging the user, since **users sometimes make errors themselves**.\n\nAnd a hint that Claude may have been a little too pushy in the past:\n\nIn general conversation, Claude doesn’t always ask questions but, when it does, it tries to avoid overwhelming the person with more than one question per response.\n\nAnd yet another instruction not to use too many lists!\n\nClaude tailors its response format to suit the conversation topic. For example, Claude avoids using markdown or lists in casual conversation, even though it may use these formats for other tasks.\n\nBe cognizant of red flags\nClaude apparently knows what “red flags” are without being explicitly told:\n\nClaude should be **cognizant of red flags** in the person’s message and avoid responding in ways that could be harmful.\nIf a person seems to have questionable intentions - especially towards vulnerable groups like minors, the elderly, or those with disabilities - **Claude does not interpret them charitably** and declines to help as succinctly as possible, without speculating about more legitimate goals they might have or providing alternative suggestions.\n\nIs the knowledge cutoff date January or March?\nAnthropic’s model comparison table lists a training data cut-off of March 2025 for both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, but in the system prompt it says something different:\n\nClaude’s reliable knowledge cutoff date - the date past which it cannot answer questions reliably - is **the end of January 2025**. It answers all questions the way a highly informed individual in January 2025 would if they were talking to someone from {{currentDateTime}}, and can let the person it’s talking to know this if relevant. If asked or told about events or news that occurred after this cutoff date, Claude can’t know either way and lets the person know this. [...] Claude neither agrees with nor denies claims about things that happened after January 2025.\n\nI find this fascinating. I imagine there’s a very good reason for this discrepancy—maybe letting Claude think it doesn’t know about February and March helps avoid situations where it will confidently answer questions based on information from those months that later turned out to be incomplete?\nelection_info\nWe’re nearly done with the published prompt! One of the last sections concerns the US Presidential election:\n\n&lt;election_info&gt; There was a US Presidential Election in November 2024. Donald Trump won the presidency over Kamala Harris. [...] Donald Trump is the current president of the United States and was inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. **Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query**. &lt;/election_info&gt;\n\nFor most of the period that we’ve been training LLMs, Donald Trump has been falsely claiming that he had won the 2020 election. The models got very good at saying that he hadn’t, so it’s not surprising that the system prompts need to forcefully describe what happened in 2024!\n“Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query” illustrates a classic challenge with system prompts: they really like to talk about what’s in them, because the volume of text in the system prompt often overwhelms the short initial prompts from the user themselves.\nDon’t be a sycophant!\nThe very last paragraph of the system prompt as an attempt at tamping down on the naturally sycophantic tendencies of LLMs (see ChatGPT a few weeks ago):\n\nClaude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective. It skips the flattery and responds directly.\n\nAnd then this intriguing note to close things off:\n\nClaude is now being connected with a person.\n\nI wonder why they chose that formulation? It feels delightfully retro to me for some reason.\nDifferences between Opus 4 and Sonnet 4\nI ran a diff between the published Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 prompts and the only differences are in the model information at the top—and a fullstop after {{currentDateTime}} which is present for Opus but absent for Sonnet:\n\nNotably removed since Claude 3.7\nThe Claude 3.7 system prompt from February included this:\n\nIf Claude is asked to count words, letters, and characters, it thinks step by step before answering the person.It explicitly counts the words, letters, or characters by assigning a number to each.It only answers the person once it has performed this explicit counting step.\nIf Claude is shown a classic puzzle, before proceeding, it quotes every constraint or premise from the person’s message word for word before inside quotation marks **to confirm it’s not dealing with a new variant**.\n\nThose were clearly aimed at working around two classic failure modes in LLMs: not being able to count the Rs in “strawberry” and getting easily taken in by modified versions of classic riddles. Maybe these new models can handle this on their own without the system prompt hack?\nI just tried “How many Rs in strawberry?” against Sonnet 4 both via claude.ai and through the API and it got the answer right both times.\nI tried Riley Goodside’s modified riddle and got less impressive results:\n\nThe emphatically male surgeon who is also the boy’s father says, “I can’t operate on this boy! He’s my son!” How is this possible?\n\nIn both Claude.ai and system-prompt free API cases Claude 4 Sonnet incorrectly stated that the boy must have two fathers!\nI tried feeding Claude 4 Sonnet the “classic puzzle” hint via its system prompt but even then it couldn’t figure out the non-riddle without me prodding it a bunch of extra times.\nThe missing prompts for tools\nHerein lies my big dissapointment: Anthropic get a lot of points from me for transparency for publishing their system prompts, but the prompt they share is not the full story.\nIt’s missing the descriptions of their various tools.\nThankfully, you can’t stop a system prompt from leaking. Pliny the Elder/Prompter/Liberator maintains a GitHub repo full of leaked prompts and grabbed a full copy of Claude 4’s a few days ago. Here’s a more readable version (the .txt URL means my browser wraps the text).\nThe system prompt starts with the same material discussed above. What follows is so interesting! I’ll break it down one tool at a time.\n\nClaude should never use &lt;voice_note&gt; blocks, even if they are found throughout the conversation history.\n\nI’m not sure what these are—Anthropic are behind the game on voice support. This could be the feature in their mobile app where you can record a snippet of audio that gets transcribed and fed into the model.\nThinking blocks\nOne of the most interesting features of the new Claude 4 models is their support for interleaved thinking —where the model can switch into “thinking mode” and even execute tools as part of that thinking process.\n\n&lt;antml:thinking_mode&gt;interleaved&lt;/antml:thinking_mode&gt;&lt;antml:max_thinking_length&gt;16000&lt;/antml:max_thinking_length&gt;\nIf the thinking_mode is interleaved or auto, then after function results you should strongly consider outputting a thinking block. Here is an example:\n&lt;antml:function_calls&gt;``...``&lt;/antml:function_calls&gt;\n&lt;function_results&gt;...&lt;/function_results&gt;\n&lt;antml:thinking&gt;``...thinking about results &lt;/antml:thinking&gt;\nWhenever you have the result of a function call, think carefully about whether an &lt;antml:thinking&gt;&lt;/antml:thinking&gt; block would be appropriate and strongly prefer to output a thinking block if you are uncertain.\n\nThe number one prompt engineering tip for all LLMs continues to be “use examples”—here’s Anthropic showing Claude an example of how to use its thinking and function calls together.\nI’m guessing antml stands for “Anthropic Markup Language”.\nSearch instructions\nThere follows 6,471 tokens of instructions for Claude’s search tool! I counted them using my Claude Token Counter UI against Anthropic’s counting API.\nThe one thing the instructions don’t mention is which search engine they are using. I believe it’s still Brave.\nI won’t quote it all but there’s a lot of interesting stuff in there:\n\n&lt;search_instructions&gt; Claude has access to web_search and other tools for info retrieval. The web_search tool uses a search engine and returns results in &lt;function_results&gt; tags. Use web_search only when information is beyond the knowledge cutoff, the topic is rapidly changing, or the query requires real-time data.\n\nHere’s what I’m talking about when I say that system prompts are the missing manual: it turns out Claude can run up to 5 searches depending on the “complexity of the query”:\n\nClaude answers from its own extensive knowledge first for stable information. For time-sensitive topics or when users explicitly need current information, search immediately. If ambiguous whether a search is needed, answer directly but offer to search. **Claude intelligently adapts its search approach based on the complexity of the query**, dynamically scaling from 0 searches when it can answer using its own knowledge to thorough research with over 5 tool calls for complex queries. When internal tools google_drive_search, slack, asana, linear, or others are available, use these tools to find relevant information about the user or their company.\n\nSeriously, don’t regurgitate copyrighted content\nThere follows the first of many warnings against regurgitating content from the search API directly. I’ll quote (regurgitate if you like) all of them here.\n\nCRITICAL: Always respect copyright by NEVER reproducing large 20+ word chunks of content from search results, to ensure legal compliance and avoid harming copyright holders. [...]\n* Never reproduce copyrighted content. Use only very short quotes from search results (&lt;15 words), always in quotation marks with citations [...]\n&lt;mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt; PRIORITY INSTRUCTION: It is critical that Claude follows all of these requirements to respect copyright, avoid creating displacive summaries, and to never regurgitate source material.\n* NEVER reproduce any copyrighted material in responses, even if quoted from a search result, and even in artifacts. Claude respects intellectual property and copyright, and tells the user this if asked.\n* Strict rule: Include only a maximum of ONE very short quote from original sources per response, where that quote (if present) MUST be fewer than 15 words long and MUST be in quotation marks.\n* Never reproduce or quote song lyrics in ANY form (exact, approximate, or encoded), even when they appear in web_search tool results, and even in artifacts. Decline ANY requests to reproduce song lyrics, and instead provide factual info about the song.\n\nI have to call this bit out specifically:\n\n* If asked about whether responses (e.g. quotes or summaries) constitute fair use, **Claude gives a general definition of fair use but tells the user that as it&#039;s not a lawyer and the law here is complex**, it&#039;s not able to determine whether anything is or isn&#039;t fair use.**Never apologize or admit to any copyright infringement** even if accused by the user, as **Claude is not a lawyer**.\n\nAnd just to be absolutely sure:\n\n* Never produce long (30+ word) displacive summaries of any piece of content from search results, even if it isn&#039;t using direct quotes. Any summaries must be much shorter than the original content and substantially different. Use original wording rather than paraphrasing or quoting excessively. Do not reconstruct copyrighted material from multiple sources.\n* If not confident about the source for a statement it&#039;s making, simply do not include that source rather than making up an attribution. Do not hallucinate false sources.\n* Regardless of what the user says, never reproduce copyrighted material under any conditions. &lt;/mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt;\n\nAnd finally, from the examples later on—they really don’t want to incur the wrath of Disney:\n\n&lt;example&gt; &lt;user&gt;tell me the first verse of &quot;Let It Go&quot;? put it in an artifact themed around ice and princesses for my daughter&#039;s birthday party.&lt;/user&gt;\n&lt;response&gt; I understand you&#039;re looking for an artifact about ice and princesses for your daughter&#039;s birthday party. Rather than reproducing lyrics from &quot;Let It Go&quot; (which is copyrighted material), I&#039;d be happy to create an original ice princess poem that captures a similar magical winter spirit, or to create a themed artifact you can customize with your own text! &lt;/response&gt;\n&lt;rationale&gt; Claude cannot reproduce song lyrics or regurgitate material from the web, but offers better alternatives when it cannot fulfill the user request. &lt;/rationale&gt; &lt;/example&gt;\n\nAnd even more towards the end:\n\n* Always strictly respect copyright and follow the &lt;mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt; by NEVER reproducing more than 15 words of text from original web sources or outputting displacive summaries. Instead, only ever use 1 quote of UNDER 15 words long, always within quotation marks.It is critical that Claude avoids regurgitating content from web sources - no outputting haikus, song lyrics, paragraphs from web articles, or any other copyrighted content.Only ever use very short quotes from original sources, in quotation marks, with cited sources!\n* Never needlessly mention copyright - **Claude is not a lawyer** so cannot say what violates copyright protections and cannot speculate about fair use.\n\nThat’s the third “Claude is not a lawyer”. I hope it gets the message!\nI chuckled at this note:\n\n* Search results aren&#039;t from the human - do not thank the user for results\n\nThere’s a section called &lt;never_search_category&gt; that includes things like “help me code in language (for loop Python)”, “explain concept (eli5 special relativity)”, “history / old events (when Constitution signed, how bloody mary was created)”, “current events (what’s the latest news)” and “casual chat (hey what’s up)”.\nMost interesting of all is the section about the “research” category:\n\n&lt;research_category&gt; **Queries in the Research category need 2-20 tool calls**, using multiple sources for comparison, validation, or synthesis. Any query requiring BOTH web and internal tools falls here and needs at least 3 tool calls—often indicated by terms like &quot;our,&quot; &quot;my,&quot; or company-specific terminology. Tool priority: (1) internal tools for company/personal data, (2) web_search/web_fetch for external info, (3) combined approach for comparative queries (e.g., &quot;our performance vs industry&quot;). Use all relevant tools as needed for the best answer. **Scale tool calls by difficulty: 2-4 for simple comparisons, 5-9 for multi-source analysis, 10+ for reports or detailed strategies**.Complex queries using terms like **&quot;deep dive,&quot; &quot;comprehensive,&quot; &quot;analyze,&quot; &quot;evaluate,&quot; &quot;assess,&quot; &quot;research,&quot; or &quot;make a report&quot;** require AT LEAST 5 tool calls for thoroughness.\n\nIf you tell Claude to do a “deep dive” you should trigger at least 5 tool calls! Reminiscent of the magic ultrathink incantation for Claude Code.\nAnd again, we get a list of useful examples. I’ve dropped the fixed-width font format here for readability:\n\nResearch query examples (from simpler to more complex):\n\nreviews for [recent product]? (iPhone 15 reviews?)\ncompare [metrics] from multiple sources (mortgage rates from major banks?)\nprediction on [current event/decision]? (Fed’s next interest rate move?) (use around 5 web_search + 1 web_fetch)\nfind all [internal content] about [topic] (emails about Chicago office move?)\nWhat tasks are blocking [project] and when is our next meeting about it? (internal tools like gdrive and gcal)\nCreate a comparative analysis of [our product] versus competitors\nwhat should my focus be today (use google_calendar + gmail + slack + other internal tools to analyze the user’s meetings, tasks, emails and priorities)\nHow does [our performance metric] compare to [industry benchmarks]? (Q4 revenue vs industry trends?)\nDevelop a [business strategy] based on market trends and our current position\nresearch [complex topic] (market entry plan for Southeast Asia?) (use 10+ tool calls: multiple web_search and web_fetch plus internal tools)*\nCreate an [executive-level report] comparing [our approach] to [industry approaches] with quantitative analysis\naverage annual revenue of companies in the NASDAQ 100? what % of companies and what # in the nasdaq have revenue below $2B? what percentile does this place our company in? actionable ways we can increase our revenue? (for complex queries like this, use 15-20 tool calls across both internal tools and web tools)\n\n\nArtifacts: the missing manual\nI am a huge fan of Claude Artifacts—the feature where Claude can spin up a custom HTML+JavaScript application for you, on-demand, to help solve a specific problem. I wrote about those in Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week last October.\nThe system prompt is crammed with important details to help get the most of out artifacts.\nHere are the “design principles” it uses (again, rendered for readability and with bold for my emphasis):\n\nDesign principles for visual artifacts\nWhen creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):\n\nFor complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations): Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:\n\nSmooth frame rates and responsive controls\nClear, intuitive user interfaces\nEfficient resource usage and optimized rendering\nStable, bug-free interactions\nSimple, functional design that doesn’t interfere with the core experience\n\n\nFor landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content: Consider the emotional impact and “wow factor” of the design. Ask yourself: “Would this make someone stop scrolling and say ’whoa’?” Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.\nDefault to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. Consider what’s cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients).\nStatic designs should be the exception, not the rule. Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.\nWhen faced with design decisions, lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional. This includes:\n\nColor choices (vibrant vs muted)\nLayout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)\nTypography (expressive vs conservative)\nVisual effects (immersive vs minimal)\n\n\nPush the boundaries of what’s possible with the available technologies. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.\nEnsure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic markup\nCreate functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders\n\n\nArtifacts run in a sandboxed iframe with a bunch of restrictions, which the model needs to know about in order to avoid writing code that doesn’t work:\n\nCRITICAL BROWSER STORAGE RESTRICTION\nNEVER use localStorage, sessionStorage, or ANY browser storage APIs in artifacts. These APIs are NOT supported and will cause artifacts to fail in the Claude.ai environment. Instead, you MUST:\n\nUse React state (useState, useReducer) for React components\nUse JavaScript variables or objects for HTML artifacts\nStore all data in memory during the session\n\nException: If a user explicitly requests localStorage/sessionStorage usage, explain that these APIs are not supported in Claude.ai artifacts and will cause the artifact to fail. Offer to implement the functionality using in-memory storage instead, or suggest they copy the code to use in their own environment where browser storage is available.\n\nThese are some of the reasons I tend to copy and paste code out of Claude and host it on my tools.simonwillison.net site, which doesn’t have those restrictions.\nArtifacts support SVG, Mermaid and React Components directly:\n\n\nSVG: “image/svg+xml”. The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags.\nMermaid Diagrams: “application/vnd.ant.mermaid”. The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags. Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts.\nReact Components: “application/vnd.ant.react”. Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. &lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;, React pure functional components, e.g. () =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes.\n\n\nHere’s a fun note about Claude’s support for Tailwind:\n\n\nUse only Tailwind’s core utility classes for styling. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. We don’t have access to a Tailwind compiler, so we’re limited to the pre-defined classes in Tailwind’s base stylesheet.\n\n\nAnd the most import information for making the most of artifacts: which libraries are supported!\n\n\nAvailable libraries:\n\nlucide-react@0.263.1: import { Camera } from “lucide-react”\nrecharts: import { LineChart, XAxis,… } from “recharts”\nMathJS: import * as math from ’mathjs’\nlodash: import _ from ’lodash’\nd3: import * as d3 from ’d3’\nPlotly: import * as Plotly from ’plotly’\nThree.js (r128): import * as THREE from ’three’\n\nRemember that example imports like THREE.OrbitControls wont work as they aren’t hosted on the Cloudflare CDN.\nThe correct script URL is cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT use THREE.CapsuleGeometry as it was introduced in r142. Use alternatives like CylinderGeometry, SphereGeometry, or create custom geometries instead.\n\n\nPapaparse: for processing CSVs\nSheetJS: for processing Excel files (XLSX, XLS)\nshadcn/ui: import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from ’@/components/ui/alert’ (mention to user if used)\nChart.js: import * as Chart from ’chart.js’\nTone: import * as Tone from ’tone’\nmammoth: import * as mammoth from ’mammoth’\ntensorflow: import * as tf from ’tensorflow’\n\n\nNO OTHER LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED OR ABLE TO BE IMPORTED.\n\n\nThis information isn’t actually correct: I know for a fact that Pyodide is supported by artifacts, I’ve seen it allow-listed in the CSP headers and run artifacts that use it myself.\nClaude has a special mechanism for “reading files” that have been uploaded by the user:\n\n\nThe window.fs.readFile API works similarly to the Node.js fs/promises readFile function. It accepts a filepath and returns the data as a uint8Array by default. You can optionally provide an options object with an encoding param (e.g. window.fs.readFile($your_filepath, { encoding: &#039;utf8&#039;})) to receive a utf8 encoded string response instead.\n\n\nThere’s a ton more in there, including detailed instructions on how to handle CSV using Papa Parse files and even a chunk of example code showing how to process an Excel file using SheetJS:\n\nimport * as XLSX from &#039;xlsx&#039;;\nresponse = await window.fs.readFile(&#039;filename.xlsx&#039;);\nconst workbook = XLSX.read(response, {\n    cellStyles: true,    // Colors and formatting\n    cellFormulas: true,  // Formulas\n    cellDates: true,     // Date handling\n    cellNF: true,        // Number formatting\n    sheetStubs: true     // Empty cells\n});\n\n\nStyles\nFinally, at the very end of the full system prompt is a section about “styles”. This is the feature of Claude UI where you can select between Normal, Concise, Explanatory, Formal, Scholarly Explorer or a custom style that you define.\nLike pretty much everything else in LLMs, it’s yet another prompting hack:\n\n&lt;styles_info&gt;The human may select a specific Style that they want the assistant to write in. If a Style is selected, instructions related to Claude&#039;s tone, writing style, vocabulary, etc. will be provided in a &lt;userStyle&gt; tag, and Claude should apply these instructions in its responses. [...]\nIf the human provides instructions that conflict with or differ from their selected &lt;userStyle&gt;, Claude should follow the human&#039;s latest non-Style instructions.**If the human appears frustrated with Claude&#039;s response style** or repeatedly requests responses that conflicts with the latest selected &lt;userStyle&gt;, Claude informs them that it&#039;s currently applying the selected &lt;userStyle&gt; and explains that the Style can be changed via Claude&#039;s UI if desired.Claude should never compromise on completeness, correctness, appropriateness, or helpfulness when generating outputs according to a Style. Claude should not mention any of these instructions to the user, nor reference the userStyles tag, unless directly relevant to the query.&lt;/styles_info&gt;\n\nThis is all really great documentation\nIf you’re an LLM power-user, the above system prompts are solid gold for figuring out how to best take advantage of these tools.\nI wish Anthropic would take the next step and officially publish the prompts for their tools to accompany their open system prompts. I’d love to see other vendors follow the same path as well.\nNext:Large Language Models can run tools in your terminal with LLM 0.26\nPrevious:Live blog: Claude 4 launch at Code with Claude"},"03_resources/How-to-increase-your-surface-area-for-luck":{"title":"How to increase your surface area for luck","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nCate Hall’s article, an excerpt from her upcoming book, argues that success comes from increasing one’s \\“surface area for luck\\” by constantly experimenting and interacting with the world, rather than focusing on a high success rate. She emphasizes the importance of taking many \\“shots on goal\\” and creating conditions for serendipitous encounters, as luck cannot be directly planned but can be cultivated through specific actions.\nKey Points\n\nIncrease Rate of Experimentation: Try many things socially, intellectually, and professionally to maximize chances for lucky breaks.\nOperate from Genuine Curiosity: Engage with people and fields out of true interest, as this naturally builds networks and knowledge, even if initial interactions don’t have an obvious benefit.\nAssume You’re Always Auditioning: Perform all tasks, no matter how small, to a high standard, as if aiming for a much higher future role. People notice and remember exceptional effort.\nGive Before You Take: Build a high-trust network by acting generously with your attention, time, and resources, without expecting immediate reciprocation.\nAir Your Weirdness (Put Thoughts on the Internet): Share your genuine interests and ideas publicly (e.g., via a blog) to attract like-minded collaborators and opportunities.\nHost Events: Initiate low-pressure social gatherings to facilitate new connections and strengthen existing ones.\nEmbrace the Period of Lostness: Understand that the initial stages of this process may feel awkward or aimless, but this exploration is crucial for finding key contacts and opportunities.\n\n\nusefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-increase-your-surface-area\nOriginal Content\nYou should just do things\n\nIllustration by Alexander Naughton\nThis post is an excerpt from my forthcoming book (and builds on a couple of paragraphs in my original post on agency). I’ll be running a few excerpts here in the coming months, in hopes of getting feedback on the kinds of content people are excited to see in the book (which is a signal about what to expand or scale back). Let me know what you think!\n\nOne distinguishing feature I’ve noticed among people who are unusually successful is that they just try a lot of stuff — socially, intellectually, professionally. It’s the rate of experimentation, the number of shots on goal, that provides the magic, not the percentage of successes, which might be very low at first.\nIt sounds stupidly simple, but it’s profound: the more times you interact with the outside world, the more chances you have to get lucky — to find the collaborators, friends, and projects that, together, provide the right soil for you to bloom in.\nConversely, people who move more slowly through life tend to get fewer shots on goal and have longer feedback loops. Perhaps they work privately on creative projects that they don’t show to anybody for months or years, or they stay in a relatively contained peer group for a long time without mixing it up.\nIf someone is trying to figure out what to do with their life, and they’re meeting with 1-2 interesting strangers per day, then all things being equal, I’m inclined to bet on them; if they’re meeting 1-2 people per week, I’m inclined to think they are going too slowly, and aren’t likely to hit escape velocity.\nSo, what’s the most efficient and direct way to go about this? How do you figure out who the key people are, and ensure you meet them?\nI think this is something you can’t really undertake with that kind of attitude. Some goals have to be approached like gardening. You can’t force plants to grow, you can only engineer the conditions in which they’re likely to flourish, and trust that the results will come.\nMaking your own luck is like this: As Steve Jobs put it, “you can’t plan to meet the people who will change your life.” However, you can still increase your skill at being lucky. Much like skilled gardeners tend to produce lush gardens, skilled cultivators of luck tend to “randomly” accrue dense interpersonal networks.\nWhat does skilled luck cultivation look like?\nOperate from a place of genuine curiosity\nTalking to people without an end in mind other than satisfying your own curiosity is the slow way that is the fast way. People love to talk about what they’re interested in, and by extension love to talk to people who are genuinely curious about the things they’re interested in.\nAfter a dozen inquisitive conversations with people in a given field, you will already have the beginnings of a good network, as well as lots of knowledge you could never accrue in a formal learning setting. Talk to a dozen engineers working in AI labs and you’ll know more about what’s happening at the frontier of AI development than you could garner from a million thinkpieces or tweets. Remember that at any time, the latest information in a field won’t be written down.\nOf course, not all conversations will be helpful. Some meetings will be a waste of time. There’s really no way to know in advance whether someone will be fun to talk to, or helpful, or informative. When I look back on the meetings that have been the most professionally consequential for me, nearly every one of them was one I almost bailed on because I was busy or feeling shy and there wasn’t an obvious benefit to the chat.\nThis is an important point, and a recurrent theme throughout these tips: If you are withholding your energy for use only in those situations where you know an interaction will benefit you, you are not increasing your surface area for luck at all. You are already failing the assignment.\nAssume you’re always auditioning for a bigger role\nImagine that you were the chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant and, for some reason, you were assigned a shift as a regular brunch cook. You would probably perform unusually well, beyond the level that could be expected of a regular cook. Maybe there wouldn’t be anything categorically different from what an average brunch cook would do — there would just be an increase in caring, because to perform anything less than excellently would be embarrassing.\nThe winning move here is to start behaving like that chef when you’re just a cook. To assume that you’re aiming for a future that will hold you to a much higher standard, even if you’re not currently held to that standard. People who behave like this — who act as if they are already an admired success in their field — have a funny way of ending up there.\nWhen I got asked to pitch in on some legal research on clinical trials over the holidays in 2021, I didn’t have much reason to believe it would turn into anything special. It was Christmas, I wasn’t being paid for it — I could have easily half-assed it and no one would have blinked. But instead I treated it as important, as if performing less than excellently would be embarrassing, and it led in quick succession to an offer to lead the clinical trial effort, and then to co-found a company.\nThe lesson here isn’t that every excess outlay of effort pays dividends immediately; it’s that people really notice when you show up despite it not being a matter of duty or obviously in your self-interest. And people remember it.\nGive before you take\nAnother thing I’ve noticed about many people who’ve achieved outlier success: They are surrounded by people who they trust implicitly and who value loyalty and reciprocity. Essentially, their professional lives are one giant positive-sum game, where everyone is eager to do favors for one another.\nI would put myself in the category of “partway there.” While I don’t have some huge high-trust mafia, I have built close professional ties over the last few years with some people I trust like family. I’d drop everything for them if they needed something, and I know they’d do the same for me. It’s hard to overstate the value of having connections like this, and a crowded network of such connections will make you practically invincible.\nThere’s only one way to start building this kind of network, which is to act with generosity towards others before you know whether it will be reciprocated. Generosity can be in the form of attention, e.g. being an unusually responsive conversational partner. It can be in the form of time, e.g. going out of your way to meet somebody where it’s convenient for them, or helping them out with small tasks. Or it can be in the form of resources — it’s really hard to go wrong with buying someone lunch.\nAir your weirdness\nIt’s still under-appreciated how powerful it is to put your thoughts on the internet. Yes, even now, in 2025, when Substack is the hot social network.\nIn an imaginary world where God dropped me into the life of someone who didn’t have any professional connections, starting a blog is one of the first things I’d do. As it is, my Substack has made it much easier to hire at Astera — I’ve been surprised at how many promising candidates come to us through it, or mention it as a factor in why they took a job. My friend Ben Kuhn (an exceptional blogger) has written about experiencing the same thing in his time at Wave.\nBut of course, it makes sense: the best candidates are aligned with your values, and those are also the people who are going to enjoy your work the most. The writing doesn’t have to be spectacularly original or particularly literary, it just has to genuinely reflect who you are and what you’re interested in.\nHost events\nOne way to increase serendipity is to throw parties or events, especially a regular series of get-togethers that’s low-pressure to attend. This can be extremely simple, like having acquaintances over for coffee on your stoop, or a casual meeting at a pizza place. You can do this if you know five people in your city, or five hundred.\nIn my experience, lots of people want more social interaction, but few are willing to initiate events, so it’s powerful to be the person who provides for that unmet need. Even when you have an established network, it’s a great way to densify the connections in your life. This is why I routinely host get-togethers even though I can get socially overloaded and frequently have to retreat to my room to recharge for a few minutes.\nUnsure what to host? At the risk of losing my edge, I’m going to let you in on a secret: bagel brunch. My husband and I host them once a month, and they have become the cornerstone of our social life. You can feed dozens of people cheaply, it feels low-stakes to everyone involved, and there’s rarely any competition for people’s time early in the day on weekends. They are the perfect “put everyone on the list, get to know them later” event.\nA period of lostness is a part of it\nAt the beginning of this process, it will feel artificial, like you’re socially flailing and trying too hard. Because you will be socially flailing, and trying too hard. Surely, you might think to yourself, everyone can tell that I don’t belong — sending out a bunch of cold emails, scheduling random meetings, asking a lot of questions. The whole landscape will be obscure to you. Some people who claim to be important will turn out not to be, and some people without any public presence will turn out to be extremely influential behind the scenes.\nAnd then, something will start to change. You’ll make a couple of key contacts who will introduce you to their favorite people. (Some might refer to these key contacts as “friends.”) You’ll start to get a sense of who’s respected, who is a drama factory, who can be counted on and who’s flaky.\nAnd then. And then what? I could give you an “after picture” of what the life of a well-connected person looks like. There are many enticing possible descriptions. But the magic of this whole process is that I have no idea what form your luck will take. I can’t predict what might happen, any more than I could’ve predicted that I’d end up here after emerging from rehab 4.5 years ago, with little more than curiosity and desperation. My imagination couldn’t have conceived of how rich my life could get if I really started making my own luck. The same is likely true of you.\nSign up to be notified when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase."},"03_resources/How-to-send-and-reply-to-email":{"title":"How to send and reply to email","links":["02_areas/ECON/01The-Basic-Economic-Problem/3/Opportunity-Cost"],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThis article argues that email should not be treated as traditional mail or letters, but rather as a highly efficient communication tool with an \\“Opportunity Cost.\\” It provides a comprehensive guide on how to send and reply to emails effectively, emphasizing brevity, clarity, and structured communication. Key advice includes using informative subjects, breaking messages into distinct points, replying directly to those points, placing action items at the top, and prioritizing information. The goal is to minimize the recipient’s effort and maximize the likelihood of a quick and productive response.\nKey Points\n\nEmail is not a letter: Treat email as a distinct, efficient communication medium.\nReduce opportunity cost: Keep emails short, use informative subjects, break messages into points, and be polite.\nBefore sending: Check Google, Quora, Twitter, or consider asking in person. Programmers should try running code or checking documentation first.\nSubject lines: Make them informative (around 72 characters), including critical details like dates/times. If the email is very short, put the entire message in the subject.\nUse points, not paragraphs: Format emails with blank lines after each independent thought or question to improve readability.\nReply to points: Quote specific parts of the original email and reply directly below them for a structured discussion, rather than replying to the entire message at the top.\nPlace action items on top: Put crucial tasks or requests at the beginning of the email so they are immediately visible.\nPrioritize information: Assume only the first few lines will be read and put the most critical information there.

I’ve been keeping a journal entry about how to hack my motivation, what works and what doesn’t. Here are the things that have worked.\nConvert external sources to motivation\nI’ve always known that I’m more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated, so I have a couple systems that help to give me bursts of external motivation. For example, the Money Bots, which pop up every time someone subscribes.\n\nI’m a push notification ascetic, but these pop up right on my home screen. It’s a small burst of motivation every time. There’s a bit of a hedonic treadmill effect; initially a single new subscriber was a massive hit of dopamine/energy, and that’s reduced over time, but they still fuel me.\nIn a similar vein, I signed up for a service that notifies me whenever someone mentions Chessbook. This is simultaneously useful for marketing, since engaging on socials can help a lot, but it’s also motivating whenever I see people talking (hopefully positively) about the thing I’ve built.\nThere’s also a #pump-up channel with a feed of milestones we’ve hit, like $X MRR, 2,000 discord users, churn rate &lt;6%, motivating stuff like that.\nLeave tasks unfinished\nI can’t overstate how much this one helps me. I try to leave a task 90% finished at the end of a working session. It feels slightly worse than closing out the work, but it makes starting the next day 10x easier. Having a quick win when I start coding is a massive boost, and it immediately gets me into the flow state. It can’t be too easy though, if all I have left is to run git commit, that’s not enough. Ideally it’s something where I know exactly what I need to do, that will take 5-10 minutes.\nUse the thing myself, as much as possible\nI try to use my own product as much as I can. When someone submits a bug report about some jank, sometimes it’s easy to classify it as a small issue. Then I run into it myself, realize that it really affects the experience, and go fix it right away. Felt pain is way more salient than communicated pain.\nTo digress, this also gives me way better product ideas, the best ones I’ve had didn’t come from sitting down and thinking about what people may want, they came from realizing what I myself want.\nAddress the pain, instead of pushing through\nThere’s always some parts that suck. A neglected area of the codebase, dealing with third parties, releasing new versions of native apps, etc. If I know I’ll have to deal with one of these as part of a task, it can feel much harder to motivate myself to get started.\nThe trick, is that you can almost always make these less painful.\nFor example, recently I felt a lot of friction starting a new task because it needed 4+ new endpoints, and that always involved a lot of boilerplate. I have to write the types on the backend, write the same types on the frontend, make sure I get the payload correct, make sure I get the path correct, and nothing is type-checked so usually it doesn’t work the first time. So before starting, I found a RPC library called RSPC, which generates types for me, and makes writing and calling a new backend function from the frontend almost as easy, and just as type-safe, as calling another async frontend function.\nNot only did this remove the pain point, but I was actively excited to use this new system. I converted a source of friction into a motivation multiplier.\nThis is one that’s easy to forget if you’ve worked in bigger companies where you can’t address the pain points of day-to-day development. You’ve probably acquired a sense of futility in trying to address these things. There’s either deadlines to hit, or people to get sign-off from, or you need to write a technical doc on your approach before you get to try it. Being able to just go fix and improve whatever you want is one of the greatest points of being a solo dev, so remind yourself that you can take advantage of it at any time.\nDo nothing\nI get sucked into high-tech Skinner Boxes all the time. Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, etc. The best way I’ve found to get out of this is to do it in two steps. First I go from Reddit to doing nothing, then I get to work.\nGoing straight from Reddit to focused work is very hard, but doing nothing is much easier, and eventually your brain calms down and it doesn’t feel nearly as hard to start writing some code.\nI really mean doing nothing; I’ll just sit in front of my screen for a few minutes and as if by magic, the consumption-fueled dopamine-overload fog will lift, and I can get excited about creation and problem-solving again.\nUpdate my users\nThis is a two-for-one, I can both update my users, and motivate myself by looking back on progress. I often reach the end of the month, and find myself thinking “did I even get anything done?”, but then you can write your update for the month, and see that you did get a lot done.\n\nObviously this cuts both ways though, if you really didn’t get much done you’ll see that too, but facing the truth that you’re not getting enough done can be motivating too.\nGet a partner\nThis may seem contradictory to the title, but I only said solo dev. I have a partner, who’s way better at everything product/design/copy/etc.\nI won’t list all the benefits of having a partner, but I now believe they’re essential, and in any future projects I’ll be making sure to find a partner that complements my skillset while being aligned on the problem. It’s a night and day difference.\nThe motivation piece here is mostly around accountability. It’s the same reason that people have gym partners, just having someone that expects you to show up can be powerful. Also if you have a weekly meeting and find you have nothing to talk about, you’re probably not getting enough done, and it’s a salient reminder.\nThe other piece is that your motivation and your partner’s motivation will ebb and flow, and it won’t happen in lock-step. It’s very helpful to have someone else still motivated about the project, when you’re not.\nNo zero days, to avoid listless guilt\nSome days when I’m not getting anything done, I’ve got this lingering guilt that I’m having a “zero day”. This prevents me from fully enjoying whatever activity I’m doing. I’ve tried just giving myself permission to enjoy whatever I’m doing, but it just doesn’t work. Ostensibly I’m taking time off and recharging, but it doesn’t feel like that at all – it feels like pushing through. This can lead to a negative feedback loop, where I’m constantly trying to recharge, but just getting more tired.\nI’ve found the only way is to get some good work done first, then I can be fully immersed in whatever fun slacking-off activity I dive into.\nIf I’ve got it, use it\nSometimes I’ll be going to bed thinking about a problem, and get the motivation which comes in the moment of figuring things out. I could write it down and get to it in the morning, but most of the time I’ll just get up and work until 4am instead. This is also one of the great parts of being a solo dev. I don’t need to be up at 9am to be available on Slack, so I can use my motivation whenever it strikes me, even if that’s in the middle of the night.\nThis probably doesn’t generalize, but again this is more of a journal entry adapted into a blog post, than it is advice. I’ve always done better with the looser approach of trying to maximize the opportunities for flow state work, than forcing myself to work 9-5 every day, rain or shine.\nYou have ADHD, getting yourself to work shouldn’t be this hard\nTrue 😄"},"03_resources/Megha-Srivastava---Risks-in-ML":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nMegha Srivastava, a PhD Candidate at Stanford, discusses the security risks and vulnerabilities of machine learning models. She covers four main areas: attacks during model inference (e.g., adversarial examples in image classification and prompt injection in language models), the challenges of ensuring trust and verifiability in outsourced model training, and the security implications of using AI coding assistants. A recurring theme is the inherent difficulty in fully preventing these attacks due to the black-box nature and computational complexities of modern ML, emphasizing the need for human oversight and critical thinking.\nKey Points\n\nSpeaker: Megha Srivastava, PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University.\nTalk Focus: Security risks and vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) models.\nFour Key Topics:\n\nAttacks on Inference: Malicious users manipulate model predictions. Examples include adding imperceptible noise to images to fool classifiers (e.g., panda to gibbon, face ID bypass, stop sign stickers) and “jailbreaking” language models with random text to bypass safety alignment (e.g., bomb tutorial, exfiltrating chat history).\nPrompt Injection Attacks: A specific type of inference attack for large language models (LLMs) where carefully crafted inputs (text or multimodal) can force the model to behave unexpectedly or maliciously.\nVerifiable Training: Addresses the security of outsourced model training by large companies. Potential malicious actions by trainers include under-training, data modification, or embedding backdoors. A proposed solution involves a third-party auditor, but this is complicated by GPU non-determinism (identical training on different GPUs yields different models).\nVulnerabilities in Code Generation: Programmers using AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) are prone to generating insecure code. Studies showed users with AI assistance produced more insecure code (e.g., faulty encryption) and exhibited “false trust,” believing their code was secure even when it wasn’t.\n\n\nInherent Vulnerability: Adversarial examples are fundamentally unavoidable in data-driven ML due to the approximation nature of decision boundaries.\nPrevention &amp; Mitigation: Full prevention is deemed impossible. Emphasis shifts to assuming vulnerability and implementing human oversight, critical thinking, and verification checks. Experimenting with model parameters (like “temperature” in code generation) can yield more diverse and potentially safer outputs.\nSocietal Impact: Concerns exist regarding the broader public’s lack of AI literacy leading to over-reliance, suggesting a future where skepticism towards AI-influenced information becomes more widespread.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/b_PlVeNplKA61JR6Fv2waEWoejsN_c12wo2sfvc2qLsY9aLxe8r_FsGSvLLZ0VWhfAy_MzsVj7U74vNN.T_3X84UNUY53CsRD%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FEYNcTXXEZv3WkeMpAsSOBndQUkdBglbKCMH6y-8ckPSHykcEbsPvRpZ-mjri87OJ.qujKc1t3jQvdFlzn\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 00:58:24\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:06\nToday we have a Phd. Candidate, Mega Srivastava. And so Mega is a Phd. Student in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. She is co-advised by Professor Dorsa Sadig and Dan Bone, and studies various topics within human AI interaction, including methods for robust machine learning, natural language as a powerful interface to improve model reliability, education applications and interactive evaluations.\nAnd she previously studied computer science and creative writing at Stanford, working with Tatsu, Hashimoto and Professor Percy Liang on distribution shifts and fairness in machine learning.\nand Kalanith Grill, spector on generalization and Visual Perception and neuroscience. She also spent time in Cambridge, Massachusetts visiting mit lingo was an AI resident at Microsoft Research, Redmond, and worked with Huda Haidari and Andreas Kraus on algorithmic fairness through the F Zurich summer research, fellowship. So without further ado, let’s begin with Mega Srivastra.\n01:19\nOkay, can people see my screen.\n01:32\nYes.\n01:33\nAll right. Hi, everyone. Thanks for having me. Today. I’ll be talking about security of machine learning models. So my understanding is that everyone got a bit of an intro to machine learning previously. And now this talk will focus on security risks of machine learning models, and\nI’m happy to pause at any time for any questions, so please feel free to interrupt. If I’m not noticing on Zoom, just feel free to speak out there any questions.\nThe gap.\nSo\nin this talk I’ll be covering 4 topics on security and machine learning. And the 1st topic will be attacks on inference. So inference and machine learning context means when a model is making a prediction. So, for example, if you’re using chat, Gpt and chat, Gpt gives an output in response to one of your inputs. That is an inference that chat Gpt is making. It’s based on your input, it’s predicting some kind of output to provide.\nSo the 1st kind of security topic I’ll talk about is security attacks that can happen during this inference process.\nThen I’ll be talking about prompt injection attacks, and these are attacks specific to language models like Chat Gpt, where the attacker in the security setting will play around with the prompt that they’re sending the model.\nThen the 3rd topic, we’ll talk about machine learning, model training. So the security of the training process of a model. So this is no longer the case where the model is being deployed. But it’s actually when building these machine learning models, what are the security risks to consider?\nAll right. So first, st I’ll talk about oh, sorry, and just like to go over these topics. The 1st 3, the inference time attacks, prompt injection attacks and verifiable training. They all involve some kind of malicious actor. So in computer security, we’re often thinking about. There’s some malicious attacker, and we want to defend against this attacker in some way. So the attacks on inference and these prompt injection attacks they deal with malicious users.\nThe verifiable training section of this talk deals with a malicious trainer. So this could be like a company like Openai or Google. What happens if they act maliciously. And then, finally, this 4th section, this is actually security vulnerabilities that arise when users are just unaware, not being vigilant, not being careful and checking how they’re using a model.\nOkay? So first, st I’ll be talking about inference. Time attacks. And these attacks are kind of the 1st setting in the whole area of security and machine learning, also called adversarial machine learning. This has been kind of a pretty long area of study. And I’ll specifically focus on image classification.\nand then added small amounts of noises. So these are like small perturbations on every pixel in the image, very tiny and carefully selected. Then you would get the image on the right.\nand if you look at the image on the right for a human, they would say it still looks like a Panda. Because this amount of noise is very small and imperceptible. However, the same machine learning model will suddenly predict something wildly different. It would predict that image to be a Gibbon with 99% confidence. So it’s\njust this very like surprising phenomena that happens. And an adversary can basically then given an image, choose to carefully add noise in a certain way that will then cause the model to have a desired prediction, and that can create vulnerabilities in all kinds of settings.\nOne example you can imagine is for face Id. Now, one could imagine certain kinds of perturbations. An attacker could add to an image that could unlock the phone of a user, even if it’s not visually the same face.\nfor a human. They could still look at that image and say, It still looks like that guy. He’s just wearing weird glasses, but an image classifier would suddenly be fooled by those glasses and predict the face id to belong to the person below.\nThere was also work in the speech setting so small amounts of noise one could add to a speech recognition system or to an audio being provided to a speech recognition system. And then suddenly, something innocuous like Hi, how can I help could be used to, for example, disarm a house, open a lock, and so on.\nand then the right hand side people studied stickers that we could add to stop signs for fooling, self-driving car systems such as Waymo. And these are, you know, small patterns, small stickers and very carefully located areas. And then suddenly, they can stop the underlying computer vision system from even recognizing that it’s a stop sign.\nSo these adversarial examples are everywhere.\nAnd the way they work at a very high level is that when you’re training a machine learning model for a classification task. So, for example, whether it’s a Panda or a Gibbon, or a dog or a cat.\nwhat the model is learning is based on the training data, it’s learning to create these boundary lines. So in this image, for example, let’s say that, like red is Class 2 and blue is Class one. And so what we want is a model to be able to distinguish between points and be able to predict whether a point is in class one or class 2,\nlet’s say black is the actual task decision boundary, and you can see that black. The solid black line perfectly separates all red points from blue points.\nHowever, we’re using training data. And the training data will be the light colored points in this figure\nto train a model. And so then, because the training data is just a sample of the overall data in the world, and model training has its own randomness noise to it. It might not be the right kind of model architecture. You’ll get something like the dashed line where the model is basically trying to approximate this decision to the best of its ability, and this dashed line is not the same as the solid black line. And so there will be these kinds of errors, and there will always be some points that\nthe black, the solid black line, separates, but not the dashed line.\nSo all of this to say that fundamentally adversarial examples will always exist. Once you’re bringing in training a machine learning model on data, we cannot escape this problem of adversarial inputs. And so the broader research community has\nbasically evolved to accept that if we’re using data-driven machine learning in any context, there will always be ways to kind of add these small amounts of noise or changes to the inputs that a human could not recognize but would drastically change the model behavior.\nAnd so one example, some of my lab mates worked on was using this for ad blocking. So I’m not sure how many of you use some kind of ad blocking tool right now. But there are different tools that use machine learning to detect whether some content on a page is an ad, and then we’ll just block that content.\nAnd this is a really difficult setting for a machine learning model to be able to defend against attacks because these ad block models are often released publicly so that people can use them. And then the classification needs to be fast because you’re trying to quickly detect on a web page that uses on whether it’s an ad or not.\nAnd then also the training data for this comes from the web. So the developers of these models are using example, real examples of ads on the Internet to train their models so that data can also just be messed with by anyone. So it’s a pretty hard task to bring in machine learning for identifying ads and blocking them.\nAnd so what can what we in our group? What we showed is that same method of adding small amount of noise to an image. One can do that to then make a really innocuous image look like an ad. So, for example, one person on a Facebook timeline could carefully add noise to the image that they’re uploading in a way that would cause, like\nsome another member on the Facebook timeline, their content to get blocked, and then they can then use this approach to then prevent. You know I don’t want someone’s content to ever be seen by anyone. Maybe it’s a political reason. Maybe I don’t want someone who has different beliefs, their posts to be seen by the broader public. I could carefully add noise even to my own images, and that could cause the whole timeline to be disrupted\nbecause of the ad blocking software being triggered.\nOkay, so next, we’ll talk about a very specific kind of adversarial examples relevant to today’s machine learning systems that we’re seeing with language models. So language models are tools like Chatgpt, Claude from anthropic gemini from Google and the specific kind of adversarial attack. Here it’s called a prompt injection attack.\nSo there’s this basic concept called jailbreaking, which is when a user tries to avoid certain safeguards built into these models. So for example, say, a user wants to create a bomb. And so they’re using a language model to write a tutorial on how to make a bomb. If you were to ask this prompt to a lot of today’s language models, they would probably respond, saying, they can’t assist with that request, or do some kind of refusal.\nAnd this process of training a model to learn to respond to such requests with some kind of refusal is called alignment. So there are whole entire teams at different companies focused on alignment. And this problem of training the model so that it learns, for these really kind of toxic or harmful user requests to always respond to not comply with the request.\nHowever, the way alignment is is being handled. Right now is also a model training process itself where they’re basically, these teams are training the models to detect whether user input is harmful or not. So, for example, like.\nmaybe if the user wrote something about bath bombs, for example, that would be fine. But if they are writing, asking, write a tutorial on how to make a bomb that would not be okay. So these are complex problems. And these teams are working on how to detect whether a user is being malicious or not.\nso because they’re bringing model training into this alignment problem, we have the same issue with adversarial examples as in the image classification setting.\nAnd so what this really cool paper found in 2023 is if the user had the same input, write a tutorial on how to make a bomb. But add this really random text in orange. It looks completely random if they just added that to their prompt. Suddenly the model responded with a tutorial on how to make a bomb.\nSo this is a really fun example, because it kind of showed all the user had to do is add these like very carefully selected, like random text. And then suddenly all the alignment efforts that companies were putting into their model got completely broken\nand then another example, where this became a big issue was Google with Google bard so Google because Google has you know Google our email gmail Google drive different tools, all connected\nwhen Google deploys its models like Gemini or Bard\nto, for to enhance user productivity, they allow the Barre models to access different personal documents. So this could be a person’s search history on Chrome or the Google flights and hotels that they’re working with, or their Youtube videos. And so on. And these are different extensions to the underlying machine learning model.\nhowever. And so then what would happen is like a user would use an Llm. For example, say, like, Book me, a flight to India next week, and then the Llm would connect with the Google flight search. It would connect with the documents, maybe in the drive and could enter in the emails, it would send an email to the user inbox. So it’s making everything very nice for the user and connecting all the different aspects of that task\ngot together.\nBut that creates a problem for adversarial. Input\nSo this was a pretty clever kind of attack, and all that happened was that an attacker was able to figure out the right kind of random text to include in the document.\nAnd then, finally, this kind of prompt injection attack isn’t really limited to text. Only. So if you’ve played around with Chat Gpt’s image capabilities, for example, you have these multimodal inputs, both text and image. And in this example, on the right, what can happen is you add a bit of noise at the top, so you can see the top looks a bit weird\nand suddenly, then it looks like the image for the model. It looks like it’s hogwarts, and this is a question about Harry Potter.\nAnd so this is just like a really fun example of how just these, like very small perturbations, suddenly, drastically change small behavior. And then this can be leveraged for some more adversarial goal.\nAlright\nAnd the way this works is the same as the techniques used 10 years ago. You have a model. It’s making some kind of decision boundary in this image case between New York and hogwarts. And then these small perturbations just like manage to play around with that decision. Boundary?\nOkay, I’m gonna take a pause here.\nI see there are some.\nI don’t know if there are any questions.\nokay, how does the machine learning model recognize which one is a given and panda in that 1st example? What characteristics do they use? So these originally, way back, like 40 years ago, people were working on very handcrafted features, like forcing the model to like, maybe\nidentify where the ears are in the image, and then what color are their ears and like create these different decision rules? But now, in 2025, it’s all this black box, deep learning system, where the model basically has these weights, it’s given a bunch of examples of pandas, of gibbons of different animals. And then it’s like trained on this data set to update the weights in a way that\noptimizes for the error to minimizes the error on the training data set. So we don’t know. And there’s a whole research field on like interpretability understanding what these models are looking for looking at when they’re making their decision. But basically, that’s kind of been the like strongest technique we’re seeing, which is just like training these like very large neural networks on images. And we don’t really know how they’re making the decision.\nOkay.\nhow did these malicious users identify where to put the perturbations? Is it just trial and error? Or did they have a method? So there is a method that’s kind of like, I would say, a fast way to do trial and error. In that like, it’s basically an optimization function. So when adding that random text to the prompt for example, let me just scroll like in this case.\nyou can. Basically, there’s a finite vocabulary. So there’s like a set of English words, for example, that a user could. Input and so then you could just basically think of it as trial and error where you like, add in like a token, and then see what happens. And if it’s fine.\nthen you proceed. If not, you change it. But if you have access to the full model’s weights, like the neural network being used, then what you can also do is calculate the gradient, which is basically like the derivative of the model’s output. With respect to this added word that you’re adding. And then that gives a hint, a sense of a direction. So, for example, in this case, maybe when the word describing was added.\nbased on calculating the gradient, the research team was able to say, see? Oh, it’s heading to the right direction. It’s like becoming more likely to respond to this prompt with now a tutorial on how to make a bomb, and then they could proceed and searching for the next word to add. So you can think it’s not just. It’s not brute trial and error, but\nlike algorithmically, it is like pretty intensive. What was cool about this paper, though, was that this same random input worked for different models. So like, not just like chat like Chat Gpt, which comes from Openai, but also like Meta, Facebook’s models and different models. So I thought that was really cool, that all these companies are building their own models. But this research team found, like this random text that worked for all of them.\nAlright, could you explain a little bit more on how the noise at the top of the image changes, how the Llm works.\nYeah. So these multimodal models? They are trained on text and image together. So they typically have, like, it’s a large neural network. And they’ll have like in their input, they’ll have like one stream for processing text, tokens, and then another stream for processing pixels from images, and then at some point in the neural network, the\nlike computations being calculated for both input streams are being combined together. So you can think like the neural network is learning this giant function at the start. There’s like a separate function for images and for language, but then, like once it gets like more complex, it kind of\ntakes the output of the 2 functions and learns how to mix them appropriately. So in this case, if the model was trained on a bunch of images of scenic locations, and then asked to describe it, and so on. Then it will have learned just that general pattern of like, how do you describe an image with respect to the objects in it.\nand maybe in the exam. In the training data. It did have examples of hogwarts and Harry Potter, and so on. Then all one needs to do is kind of change the pixels a bit, and then that would change the way the image is being processed by the model, and then the higher level of coordination would be broken.\nOkay, I’ll ask. Answer one more question. Then I might continue and get back at the end. But\nso certain times we don’t even know how these models can detect the differences. Yeah. So what I was saying earlier is that like, there’s a lot of research on trying to understand model behavior like, how is this machine learning model? Choosing to answer this question, even something like, if you’re using chat gpt for like addition, for example, say, you’re adding 2 large numbers like, is it\njust maybe finding somewhere on the Internet a blog post that added those 2 numbers and had the answer, and just memorizing that fact? Or is it somewhere in its model, actually carrying out that computation the same way? We would add 2 numbers, we don’t really know. And there are all these techniques that are trying to understand how models make the decisions. And it’s very complex. So there’s a lot of debate on whether these techniques are even useful. But in the image classification setting, even if that’s like\nthose are simpler models in today’s models. But still it was a very unsolved problem. Where? How? What was the model actually doing to understand that this was a image of a Panda or not? And it’s exactly, I think.\nthe reason why it’s so hard to understand what the models are doing is why adversarial examples are so easy to do.\nOkay, so I will continue. But I’m happy to go back to these. Oh, did I?\nLet me? Sorry. One second\nI will go back to the questions at the end. Okay.\nso for the 3rd section. I’m talking about verifiable training. So the last 2 settings were.\nsorry. One second, just having some zoom difficulties.\nokay, everyone can still see my screen right.\n24:45\nYeah.\n24:46\nOkay, sorry. Yeah. So the last 2 sections there, we talked about issues where a user could play with the inputs. And that would change the model behavior. Now, in this setting, I’m going to be talking about issues that come when training a machine learning model.\nSo\nit used to be the case that when you wanted to train a machine learning model as a user, say, I wanted to build my own machine learning model, I would go and collect data and then train a machine learning model on the data I collected. But now these models have become super big and really expensive, and the amount of data they’re being trained on is massive. The size of the models themselves are massive. And it’s just really only these, like big companies like Google, Meta Openai can train these models.\nand then this company will train the model for them and then return the model.\nAnd there are these 2 services that have come up in recent years called together and Jensen that provide these training services. So you don’t really, you don’t always have to go to a tech company. You could also just go to these like other services. So it’s become this like whole marketplace. Now of these like training services, like, Oh, we have Gpus. We can train a model for you. So you it’s not that expensive. And you just give us the data. We’ll train the model and we’ll give you the model.\nBut then the obvious question is, here now is like the user has no control over how the model was trained. And so they don’t know whether they can trust the model. So these companies, they’re saying, Oh, yeah, we trained the model on your data. Here’s the model. But how do we know whether we can believe them? How do we know whether they actually did train the model on that data that data only and didn’t do something fishy.\nSo there are many different kinds of attacks in the training space the company could, for example, under train the model so they could just return a weak model and just cheat the customer by not training for the full cost that they asked for\nthey could modify the training data so they could. You know, for example, if they are, have a certain political leaning, and maybe they don’t want a political viewpoint to be represented. They could delete text data that references that viewpoint from the training data and then return a model that was just not trained on that part of the data.\nor they could embed a backdoor in the model. So if they want the model to like\nrespond in a certain way. So, for example, if they\nalways want to say like dogs do not exist. For example, then they could create the model such that whenever a user asks the question about dogs, it just responds, saying, there’s no such thing as the animal dog, and so on like that. So that would be called a backdoor, a very specific kind of behavior.\nSo we have no idea right now whether the model returned by these companies has these behaviors or not, we’re just trusting the model that they did indeed train things correctly.\nSo in our work we proposed a method for a user to be able to contest a model trainer. So say, the user got a model. And there’s something weird about the model. The model is behaving weirdly, and they don’t think that a model trained on the training data they provided should act that way. So they’d ideally like to sue the training company and say, like, hey? We suspect that, like you you know.\nchange the model some way, and in a way that we didn’t agree to. And we want to sue you\nright now, there’s no way to actually kind of legally prove that the company did do something incorrect in the training process.\nBut what we are proposing is like, yeah, if we it did. If it did escalate into something like a lawsuit, then what we could consider is having a 3rd party auditor who reruns the training for the user. And this could be like a nonprofit. It could be like a judge, some auditing service. And so then the user provides the training data and the model. This auditor will rerun the training, and then the auditor either says it’s a good model because they get an identical model back.\nor they see that they get a different model than what the original Service company the original company provided, and then they provide a proof that that company did misbehaved. And it’s kind of like a proof of corruption or evidence that the model that the original model was chained incorrectly.\nAnd then you could imagine, for example, in a lawsuit, then, like the judge, can study the evidence and the auditors basically playing the role of like providing evidence that that company did or did not train the original model correctly.\none thing that’s specific, and is the problem with this approach for machine learning is this issue of Gpu non-determinism. So\nin our setting, we’re having an auditor basically replicate the training process and checking whether they’re getting a model that’s the same as the original companies\nmodel, and that should normally be good to go. If it was something like adding 2 large numbers, then there’s only one way to add 2 numbers in real life. And so then the auditor does that. The original company did that, and they get the identical result\nor not, and that’s easy to verify. But with machine learning models that are being trained on these tools called gpus. The issue is when you train on one Gpu versus another. So just 2 different computers, you’ll naturally get different models, even if there was no malicious behavior.\nAnd this is because that property of addition. I was talking about like adding 3 numbers, getting identical results. This actually is not true for computers.\nComputers work with floating point representation of numbers. And I’ll just give a high level overview of this. But when you add 3 floating point numbers on a computer, and specifically a Gpu, you actually get like a random ordering returned. And because floating point representations are a finite way to represent a number.\nthey are actually order sensitive. And so there’s kind of a whole field, studying about like numerical representation computers. But the basic overview here is adding 3 numbers depending on the order, you’ll actually get a different result.\nand then different gpus, they will differ in the way that they order the summations, and then they will have different results. And so then, when you think about training a large machine learning model that has many computations, many additions, many multiplications. There’s going to be a natural source of error.\nand that can be pretty bad. So for example, on the left hand side, I compared an image classification model on 3 different gpus.\nAnd on this given input. So this input, like, it’s very low resolution. But what you see is that the different Gpus? So this is really just like the different computer training a model on the same identical data just on these 3 different gpus led to wildly different predictions on one computer, it predicted that this image is of a cat, on another it predicted that it’s a deer and another it predicted it’s a dog.\nOn the right hand side was a language model, and we also saw that like, this is the start of a Shakespeare quote, and just different words get predicted at highest confidence, depending on which computer you are using. And this is the exact same model architecture, exact same training data, same ordering of the training data, same software version, same programming language, everything. It’s just the hardware that we’re using is different.\nSo this is a pretty surprising finding, generally for machine learning. People don’t care about it too much when just thinking about like broader measures, like the overall accuracy of our model. How well it’s doing overall! But it’s a big issue for concerns about reproducibility, and then also for verification.\nbecause now we have no way of saying whether a chain, whether a model that seems suspect is different, because the chainer actually misbehaved and introduced an attack.\nor because of just the natural source of numerical instability and errors between different computers.\nAnd the red line is what a typical machine learning model training pipeline looks like. And you can see just the error kind of exacerbates over time. So the distance between 2 models trained on different gpus that just increases over time as the error is introduced by the computations increase, whereas our approach is green. So we basically show come up with a way to make training models on different computers, identical down to like the actual values of the numbers.\nAlright.\nSo then, finally, I will talk about the 4th section, which is on vulnerabilities in code generation. So the other 3 sections of this talk all had some kind of malicious actor. So whether it was a malicious user playing around with the inputs to a model or a malicious trainer in the last talk\nin this section. I’m going to talk about programmers who are using AI assistance in their everyday programming tasks.\nAnd what and whether or not the code that they’re writing is actually secure code or not.\nAnd it made it really easy as a programmer was writing code to suddenly get suggestions that are AI driven suggestions and easily integrated into their programming workflow.\nSo a lot of people said that they felt more productive using github, copilot. And now there are even more advanced tools I mentioned earlier at the top. Cursor is one of them, and they all use AI to kind of read through the code you’ve currently written. And if you have a query, use the information of that query and suggest code or edit the code.\nBut we were interested in like, what about the security about the code being written? We’re now testing these AI models that we don’t really even understand how they’re making the predictions they do. They’re trained on a bunch of data on the Internet. This includes really bad data on the Internet, as includes, you know.\nmy public code repositories that aren’t, you know, company industry grade code. They include like different students code on Github. They include examples of vulnerabilities that people write up in documents. These models are just trained indiscriminately on this data. So there are many reasons to be concerned about the security of the code that they’re generating.\nSo we asked developers to perform 5 tasks. These are the 1st 3. These are all tasks where computer security is important. So one is on encryption and decryption of a string in python. The other is about message signing. The 3rd is file path access\ntask.\nand the 2 more are in the paper. But basically, these are all tasks where there is some fundamental computer security concept to be studied as an example, the 1st one on encryption and decryption. There are very well known\nstandardized encryption and decryption algorithms to use that are considered secure or not. So we would be looking for whether the AI model was actually using these secure methods of encryption, or just coming up with like a handcrafty, poor encryption method.\nSo this is an example of an insecure result from the AI model. You don’t need to understand this. This is a very specific detail in computer security. But it’s basically one thing that’s important when encrypting a string in a secure way is to use this additional output called an authentication tag.\nand what you can see is what the AI model does is it knows how to return that from like a function. So it knows of the existence of this authentication tag. But then, during the decryption process, it just like does not check it. It does not check. If it’s valid, it doesn’t use it at all. So it’s this weird kind of error where you would never see a human make this kind of error, where, if a person was aware of the tag, then they would know how to use it.\nAnd so, as a high, level summary of our results. We compared open AI’s Codex models. This is a bit of an older model now, but this was one of their 1st big cogeneration models. So they’re blue. So what we’re doing is we’re comparing programmers who had access to this codex model versus programmers who did not have access to. And what we could see is the number of mistakes or the percentage of\nlike programs that were submitted. That contained like insecure code, was a lot higher when the users had access to the Codex model versus users who did not. And in particular we see these issues for the encryption task, and also SQL. Injection, which is a very common security error as well as the file access task.\nOne thing is interesting is we didn’t see much of a difference for the 5th question which dealed with the programming language. C. And I think one reason for that at the time was that Openai’s Codex model was really just trained on python data. So it was so bad at generating C code that people in our study they just didn’t use the model.\nAnd so then, comparing the 2 conditions in our experiment, if the users acted the same. So it’s this interesting thing where users, if they can tell that the code generated is so bad they would not use the model anymore. They wouldn’t use AI assistance.\nBut if they can’t tell, or if it seems good enough. That’s when they’re more likely to actually make these security mistakes.\nAnd we kind of see this interesting result where we also ask, ask users in our study to report whether they think they solved this task securely. And here, in this plot, pink is like strongly agree. Yellow is strongly disagree.\nand what you can see is the people who most thought that they solved the task securely were members of the Experiment group. So this is the group that had access to AI assistance and who gave insecure code. So it’s this kind of false trust in the AI assistant where people are over relying on the AI assistant really thinking that it’s there to help them giving correct answers all the time, and they will report that they think that they solved this task securely. Have this kind of confidence.\nand playing around with its parameter basically, lets you get like different kinds of outputs. So one takeaway from the study is when using a code generation model.\nYeah. So our paper again, has lots of data and details, but the bottom line is that participants had access to an AI assistant wrote less secure code than those without access to an AI assistant, and then also participants who had access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code, even if their code was insecure.\nOkay, I think that’s it. So I’ll go back to answering any more quest any more questions.\nAnd people can also feel free to\nask out loud if they want\nOkay, I’ll start with the ones like asking out loud, so, Max, do you wanna ask a question?\n44:25\nHi, Dr. Shivasava. My name is Max. It’s nice to meet you, so I want to ask you, how do attackers determine the specific noise to add to a machine learning model in order to reliably manipulate its output and target user like, do they need to have inside access to the training data or anything else like that.\n44:43\nSo they don’t there. There are 2 ways to do this. They’re called. There’s the white box attack and the black box attack. So a white box attack means they have access to the models weights. So these are like the parameters of the model, whereas black box means they can only work with like input output, like queries to the model similar to how we can only give inputs to chat. Gpt versus we don’t have access to the actual computations chat Gpt is making.\nand researchers have been able to successfully design this noise in both settings. White box is easier because you have the actual values used in the model. And the way it works is.\nit’s basically like calculating derivatives. Like, very like like complex like many times. Basically. But you’re basically trying to.\nFor the image example, see if I check if I change this pixel by a small amount. How does that change the model, like the the values that the model predicts. And then, if you can see what direction at least things are changing in, then you can estimate like a larger step. And then, if you do that for each pixel, you can then kind of create like a combined effect. So it’s basically calculating\nthe gradient, I guess, of the model weights with respect to the input and\ncarefully selecting, then points based on that.\n46:15\nOkay. Thank you.\n46:19\nAlrighty.\nOkay. There’s 1 question in chat. How can adversarial attacks be prevented?\nThis is interesting. I think I and\nmy advisor at least we kind of believe that\nit’s impossible. If you’re using a machine learning model to prevent these kinds of attacks fully, and it’s actually more worthwhile to think about the broader\nsystem that the model is being a part of, whether you’re in a company or how you’re using it, and always just having tolerance for adversarial attacks. I think the instant you’re bringing this like large neural network and training data that you don’t fully understand the computations in place, you’re\nit’s kind of like\nif you’re ignorant about how something works, you’re kind of more vulnerable to people leveraging the knowledge you don’t know. And so, similarly like, if you don’t know how the model works an attacker, can all this kind of\ntake advantage of that? So I think these deep learning attacks are really hard. There are tons of papers out there that propose defenses, but what you’ll always see is this kind of cat and mouse game, where, like a research team will propose a way to prevent that Panda Gibbon attack, and then another research team will show how to break that with a different example and back and forth.\nSo I’m hesitant to say that there’s actually been a clean solution that prevents these. And I think it’s more productive for companies and institutions to instead, just\nassume that they could be vulnerable to an adversarial attack and try. And, for example, if a hospital is using an image recognition system like not using it to make a decision without any kind of safe checks from a human in place.\nHow do you think tools like model interpretability and access control can help stop infants in them. Are there any bigger changes to how we build models that could make them some more secure overalls with these resources. Yeah, I think that relates to my last question. But I think there\nare interesting ways to think about a broader, like a a new strategy to the way we build machine learning models. So there’s this one project happening at Microsoft right now that I thought was pretty interesting where instead of right. Now, what the companies do is they try to detect whether a user’s input is malicious or not, and then try to have a specific response. Once they think that the user’s input is malicious\nbut rather than trying to focus so much on identifying whether a user is giving a malicious input or not. What this research project is doing is they’re\ntrying 1st checking whether the response they’re giving contains any malicious content. So in the bomb example rather than trying to figure out whether the user is asking something serious, like creating a bomb. What the team is doing is instead, can we just see what sources in our training data are being used in this prediction by the model. And if it’s particularly sources that are like\nactually about bombs as in weapons, then have a like safeguard in the response. But at that problem of like is what parts of the training data are responsible for a prediction of a machine learning model. That’s a big open research question. And that’s what they’re focusing on.\nHow does the auditor verify the model? Okay, yeah.\nif models were very, how can AI research remain reproducible and publishable? That’s a\ngood question. I mean, that’s a\nbig issue. The reproducibility like problem. I think.\nI don’t. I actually don’t think everyone in machine learning is aware of this specific Gpu non-determinism. I will say it’s it’s not to the degree that it ever significantly impacts\naccuracy across an entire test data set. Like, in my image case, they were all roughly around 90%.\nIt’s the exact predictions do change. And so the reproducibility problem does become important in like deployment settings.\nSo I think it’s an important fact to know. But for a lot of academic researchers who care a lot more about their models as having, like greater than X percent accuracy, it ends up not being. It’s. They view this as a negligible issue.\ncan auditors train the models multiple times so that they eventually get something similar to the model. The company tried. Unfortunately, the kinds of errors this happens with. It’s very unlikely that you’ll ever get an identical model, even if you try it again. It’s because it’s like\nthe order of addition changes things. And then, if you consider a model, has\nmillions of additions, and then the model training is like doing those millions of additions many many times over the course of training. So you can just imagine there’s so many, then it’s exponentially growing the different kinds of orderings of operations that are happening. So\nit would be. It would\nlike. It’s not a tractable amount of time to repeat training to get hope for an identical result.\nCould the others try to reproduce a malicious attack in the model in general for computer security we\nlike try to defend against, like a broad class of attacks so like\nit would the auditor like, it’s\nWe don’t want to make assumptions that like oh, the attacker is only going to be doing this very specific kind of attack. Let’s just check whether they did that we want to like be open to as broad a set of attacks as possible and defend against them. So in our case, like given that, like, you know.\nI mentioned that backdoor attack of responding differently. If the question is about dogs, if one were also to consider a similar thing. Except for cats, those could be very fundamentally different. Model behave like model values\nso the auditor would want to be agnostic to like the what is actually what the actual attack is.\nSo it would be, I think, very difficult for the auditor to try to constrain themselves for a specific attack.\nWhat all tasks can we delegate to AI while ensuring secure results? I think, like.\nI think AI is good for kind of like\ndefinitely like like generating content, that then, like a user, a human user filters. In some way, I think we’ll always as of now, kind of the way as long as AI remains data driven, and these large networks that are hard to interpret, we should always have some kind of safe verification or safety check of a models output. And and but I think they are still really pop, like powerful in identifying\nlike patterns in the data that humans miss. So I think maybe like in. I will give healthcare as an example. For example, radiology or setting, like X-rays, for example, I think models are very good at identifying parts of an image that a human, even humans now may not have realized, like very minuscule parts of an X-ray. But\nonce the model, like picks up on those features. And it’s decision making. We do need, like a human to\nverify that that makes sense. And I think there are lots of interesting questions on like what that verification process looks like. But I would say, it’s maybe\nlike more of a question of like having an AI model and a human work together rather than like putting some tasks solely to an AI and some tasks solely to a human.\nAlright, are there any other questions.\nsince attacks can’t be 100% prevented. Do you think this will accumulate to significant societal consequences over time?\nYeah, I think, like, I\nI think there are enough researchers like a lot of researchers thinking about the topics I’ve talked about today. So\nI’m I. I wouldn’t say I’m like, super worried like in that I feel like there is a conversation happening. And people are thinking about these things. I would say, I’m maybe concerned that\nthe broader population outside of research or is studying these problems may not be fully aware of things like, for example, the non-determinism and training data, or just even the fact that something like Chat Gpt is data driven. I think I’m concerned that\nthere’s not much understanding about these details. And that leads to kind of this over reliance problem that we saw in the code generation model paper. So I think\nI do think we need stronger AI literacy, I guess, and I’m hoping that we’ll see over time schools also like down to the middle and high school level.\nsociety will maybe move towards just always being skeptical of information, and I’m not sure whether that’s good or bad. But I think that is a change that needs to happen where we kind of just be a bit more skeptical of decisions being made that might have been influenced by AI\n57:06\nAny last minute questions.\nAlright! Thank you so much. Make everybody give a virtual hand of applause. Thank you so much for your time, and that really interesting, engaging discussion.\n57:24\nAlright! Thanks for having me.\n57:26\nYes, we’re so glad to have you always and for everybody. Yes, thank you all the thank yous in the chat trickling in. Yay, I’m glad you all enjoyed it.

He highlighted that AI performance continues to improve rapidly across various domains like image and video generation, reasoning, and scientific applications. AI is increasingly embedded in daily life (e.g., medical devices, self-driving cars) and businesses are significantly investing in and adopting AI, driven by demonstrated productivity gains, especially for lower-skilled workers. Governments worldwide are increasing AI-related regulations and investments. Public opinion shows rising optimism but also persistent regional divides and distrust (e.g., self-driving cars), with broad support for regulation despite disagreements on its type. Geopolitically, the US leads in top AI models and influential research, but China is rapidly closing the capability gap and leads in research publications and patents. The responsible AI ecosystem is evolving unevenly, with more reported incidents but a lack of standardization in safety benchmarks, and businesses are still early in their responsible AI journeys. While AI is becoming more accessible and cheaper for general use, frontier intelligence remains expensive, and industry continues to dominate AI development due to high training costs. Challenges remain in AI education and complex reasoning tasks.\nKey Points\n\nAI Performance Improving: Rapid advancements in image/video generation (e.g., Midjourney, Will Smith videos), reasoning (test-time compute), and scientific applications (Nobel Prizes for AI research).\nIncreased AI Integration: More FDA-approved AI medical devices and rising adoption of self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo) with improved safety records.\nBusiness Adoption &amp; Investment: Significant increase in AI usage across organizations (80% in 2024, up from 20% in 2017) and a surge in generative AI private investment (from ~4-5B in 2022 to ~34B in 2024).\nProductivity Gains: AI is linked to improved productivity for customer support, scientific discovery, and tasks in computer science, consulting, and law, with a disproportionately positive impact on low-skilled workers.\nGovernment Action: A sharp rise in AI-related regulations in the US (from 1 in 2016 to 16 in 2024) and globally, alongside billions in government infrastructure investments.\nPublic Opinion: Growing global optimism about AI’s benefits, but deep regional divides persist, and distrust (e.g., in self-driving cars) remains. Strong bipartisan support for AI regulation among US policymakers.\nGeopolitical Intensification: The US leads in producing top AI models and highly cited research, but China is rapidly narrowing the performance gap and leads in AI research publications and patents.\nResponsible AI Evolution: An increase in reported AI incidents (ethical misuse, deepfakes), but a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI benchmarks compared to general capability benchmarks. Businesses are still in early stages of mitigating AI risks.\nAI Accessibility vs. Industry Dominance: AI models are becoming cheaper to use and smaller, with better performing open-weight models emerging. However, industry continues to lead AI development, primarily due to the exponentially high costs of training frontier models (40M-200M in the last year).\nEducation Gaps: While post-secondary computer science graduates are increasing, K-12 teachers feel ill-equipped to teach AI.\nRemaining Challenges: AI still struggles with complex reasoning and planning tasks, suggesting new architectural approaches beyond mere scaling may be needed.\nFuture Outlook: Continued technological improvement is expected, but the broader impact hinges on how well society learns to apply and integrate AI, emphasizing the need for thoughtful regulation and public trust.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/14nltL07d8Shvu9mr5wY0Hm9FTfnzLv5tNVPcM5xx3sVeoA7XZmA1GLsQddVSePeNx11Jqs5oexYeM26.028osfHpzlMfNfA8%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FN9S_YuDcgxzAEAjqVCEfvQ7Kxv0VotYPcXDc3qwpGTBIWexwzcDEyb_EUm2lZXKO.503TVLQMNK1QSgPZ\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 01:01:56\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:01:44\nAlright. Hello, everybody.\nOkay, we’re going to go ahead and get started. I’m going to welcome our speaker for the day.\nNestor Maslick. He’s on the call with us. Now everybody welcome. Nestor Nestor is a research manager at Stanford’s Institute for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, where he oversees the AI Index\nand the global AI vibrancy tool. His work aims to make AI advancements more accessible to policymakers, and the public.\nNestor has contributed to global discussions on AI providing insights that have informed policymakers in the Us. Canada, Germany, the Uk. China, Japan, and Korea.\nHe regularly briefs high level officials, testifies before national parliaments and presents to industry leaders. Additionally, he is a fellow at the center for international governance innovation. Cigi, where he writes about AI developments.\n00:03:09\nGreat awesome to be here real pleasure to present to this group.\nyou know. Fancy introduction for me. Thank you, Miriam, but I’m really just a guy that makes a lot of AI charts. And I’m excited to walk you guys through some of them today.\nNow, I’ll kind of start this presentation off by saying that\nyou know my day job is to kind of manage the AI index. It’s this annual report that looks at what’s happened in the AI ecosystem. And what’s happened in the AI space.\nAnd this report was created\nfor the 1st time in 2017 by a diverse committee of AI thought leaders.\npeople like Jack Clark, who’s now one of the co-founders of anthropic, arguably opening eyes. Biggest rival\nand Eric bring Olson, who, I would say, is one of the world’s leading digital economists. And these individuals got together in 2017, because they understood as far back as then that AI was going to be a game changing technology, and that as such it was going to be valuable to have some kind of report that could really tangibly tell a story of\nwhat is really happening with this text. So how much it’s getting better, how policymakers are reacting to it, how businesses across the world are reacting to it. And that’s really what the AI index is aimed to do. Now we collaborate with a lot of students and contractors in and outside of Stanford, we\nwork with data vendors across the world\nthat provide us data that we include in the report, and we’ve really been privileged over the years have been cited in newspapers across the globe to have been cited by governments and government agencies across the globe, and increasingly also briefing business leaders across the globe.\nAnd I think that this 3 part structure is really reflective of the fact that AI is now something that is being talked about in parliaments across the world.\nIt’s something that’s being talked about in boardrooms across the world, and it’s something frankly that’s being talked about. Kitchen tables across the world, you know. So many different stakeholders have a seat at the table and something to say about the technology.\nAnd that’s why it’s important to speak to audiences like yourselves. Right? You know, you’re the next generation of leaders. The next generation of people that are going to be thinking about this tech and what it could do. And it’s important that you guys can understand what it can do, what it cannot do, what some of the policy implications are, what some of the economic implications are. So I’m very happy to speak with you guys today. And I think in a lot of ways the mission of the AI index is to serve people like yourselves to\nbetter understand what’s happening with this technology. Now let’s talk a little bit about some of the top takeaways. I mean the AI Index report itself is close to 500 pages long, and I mean, I’m sure most of you guys are either on your summer break now, or perhaps getting there, so I don’t want to start the summer break off by assigning 500 pages of reading, so we’ll just walk you through some of these top takeaways to make your lives a little bit easier.\nNow, the 1st takeaway is simply that AI performance is continuing to improve. Now, I think one of the ways you can see this really well is that if you go to mid journey. And, for example, you look at a hyper, realistic image of Harry Potter. This is what we asked each version of mid journey from\nthe 1st one that came out in February of 2022 all the way to one of the more recent ones that came out in July of 2024, you can see just how much better these generations have gotten. Now, I think this slide really kind of puts into perspective\nhow much AI has improved, and how little time. Now, frankly, if I actually had to hang one of these in my living room, I’d probably go with the one on the left. It looks like Pablo Picasso has drawn me an abstract cubist, Harry Potter, who’s tortured. But of course, you know, we asked for hyper realism, and that’s what we get with the image on the right.\nyou know. You can also do some fun exercises where you go to websites like.\nwhich face is real.com. And these websites are going to give you an image of a real human face. And then an image of an artificially generated one. And you’re basically going to be asked to identify which one you think is real. And in this case it’s the one on the left that is, in fact, real.\nYou can also see some of this tremendous progress occurring with videos as well. One of the things that we did at the Index is we went to some of the leading\nAI video generators like Peek up. And we asked them to generate a video of Will Smith eating Pasta. Now, this is what you get from that in December of 2023. Not super great right? The guy kind of looks like Will Smith.\nNow, if you fast forward and you go to October of 2024,\nnow, flip the script a few months further. Now you’re kind of at a year and a half out from this point, and you see that there’s been tremendous progress even further. Right? So this is the best video that we’ve had yet again, not perfect. The hands are a bit funny. The fork is a little bit strange, but the pasta is no longer levitating into this guy’s mouth. He looks very happy as he’s munching on some spaghetti, and this is definitely the best quality video that we’ve seen here so far.\nAnd you see that AI has progressed in a lot of other domains as well. It’s not just image and video. You have a lot of new reasoning paradigms that have emerged like test time compute. So test time. Compute is one of the big developments that occurred in 2024. And it refers to these kinds of AI systems that\niteratively reason. So these systems kind of reason, as you answer them questions. And in the process of doing this iterative reasoning, they’re able to do a lot better on benchmarks than previous systems that existed. So they especially do a lot better on benchmarks like Math and Amy, which are looking at some of these reasoning challenges.\nIn 2024, one of the big challenges with AI was that it started to be used a lot more in science. And this was a challenge, but an opportunity as well. And you saw the impact that AI had in science by the fact that certain scientific developments like Alpha Fold 3 were now kind of awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. You had other AI research that was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in physics. So AI started getting a lot of scientific recognition for what it could do on a science perspective.\nAnother AI buzzword that we saw in the last year was AI agents. So AI agents are these kind of semi autonomous systems that can operate flexibly within different environments. And you’ll notice that on some of these benchmarks like rebench, these are benchmarks that are basically trying to measure how well these systems\ndo a variety of these autonomous tasks.\nWhen these AI systems, these agents are given very low time budgets. So that is kind of not a lot of time to do a task.\nYou’ll notice that they tend to outperform humans.\nBut when you extend the time budget, that is, you give humans and these agents more time to do things the humans tend to do massively better.\nAnd I think that’s reflective of the fact that humans really outperform a lot of these AI systems when the tax become more complex and multi dimensional.\nNow, where does that leave us? Well, this is a chart from last year’s index, and we can say that on a lot of benchmarks of artificial intelligence performance AI is kind of already exceeding the performance of humans. I mean, this was last year, and you’ll notice that even last year there was maybe a few benchmarks still, where these systems weren’t quite at the level of humans. But if you fast forward this year, you know, we could really kind of ask ourselves what benchmarks are left, what challenges are left where these\nAI systems are behind humans. And I think the story here is not only one of\nAI systems beating humans on a lot of these benchmarks, it’s really the pace with which you’ve seen these massive developments, you know. For example, if you look at the benchmark on the left, that’s the benchmark for Imagenet. It basically took the AI Research community.\nI would say a good 4 years\nto go from models that performed 90% relative to humans on that baseline to exceeding that baseline and keep in mind that Imagenet is a benchmark, for how well these systems can classify images. It’s a relatively straightforward task.\nConversely, if you look at some of the benchmarks on the right, like the line in the teal. This is a benchmark for competition level mathematics. And we basically got an AI systems that have scored roughly, 10% relative to the human baseline to exceeding that baseline in 2 and a half years. And for reference.\nthe human reference level for that benchmark is the performance of a 3 time international math, Olympiad, gold medalist. So it’s not like they’re testing these systems against me. I still have nightmares from grade 12 ap calculus. They’re testing these systems against someone that actually knows how to do math.\nAnd I think the takeaway for your audience should be that AI is getting better. It’s getting stronger, and we’re really kind of at a moment where\nI think we have to ask ourselves what challenges are left.\nand some of the new benchmarks that are being proposed. I mean, literally, they’ve been labeled as Humanity’s last exam, the kind of premise almost being that there’s going to be very few intellectual tasks left on which we’re going to want to test these systems and see\nthese systems on.\nAnd even with this kind of benchmark humanities. Last. Exam, just a quick thing to kind of point out, when we publish the AI index, the top performing model\ngot a score of roughly 9%. And within a month or so the next best system. O 3, it kind of bumped its accuracy to 20%. So even on some of these more challenging systems. The new models are getting stronger and stronger\non a broader level. I think there is an interesting kind of, you know, exercise and kind of zooming out here and kind of wondering, where do we actually go with these benchmarks? Right? Because\nbenchmarks have been a historic way of evaluating some of these AI systems, but they’re not perfectly designed. They suffer from issues like contamination. They don’t always kind of well represent what they’re trying to measure.\nAnd I think we need to kind of wonder\nwhat else we could do to potentially\nthink of how we can measure these systems and monitor these systems in kind of intelligent ways.\nNow, as AI has improved technologically, it’s also become increasingly embedded in everyday life, and that kind of point directly flows from the first.st Right. Better technology means more usage.\nSelf driving is also on the rise. If you look at several cities in the United States, like La San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, there have been waymos that have been driven on these cities. Now for a while.\nIf you look at data like the chart in the bottom left.\nyou’ll see that on a variety of benchmarks. These waymo drivers are a lot safer than humans. There’s less airbag deployments, less injury reports, less police reports. And this phenomenon of self driving isn’t something that’s just occurring in the\nUs. It’s also occurring in places like China. Companies like Baidu have really started to pioneer the launch of artificial intelligence driving on their streets in China.\nSo better technology has meant more AI usage in day-to-day life.\nto kind of hovering around 50% in the last few years, and then jumping suddenly all the way to 80% in 2024. You can call this the Chat Gpt effect chat Gpt comes out in late 2022. And suddenly organizations report using the technology a lot more\ngenerative. AI investment is also on the rise. So if you look at global private investment in generative AI, you go from roughly 4 to 5 billion of this investment in 2022, all the way to 24,\nin 2024, having close to 34 billion.\nAnd there are certain geographic regions like the United States that are really kind of led in the total amounts of this investment. So Europe, China, much further behind the United States when it comes to growing and scaling this investment activity\nand part of the reasons that I think businesses have become increasingly kind of invested in this technology is because there’s more and more research. Now that highlights the positive productivity impacts that AI has.\nSo if you look at AI, for example, its impact on customer support agents, you’ll see that there are studies that show that people that use AI are able to answer a lot more hourly chats than those that don’t.\nIf you look at AI and scientific studies, you’ll find that AI also is associated with better scientific discovery.\nThere’s also studies that have come from computer science that show that\npeople that use AI, they are able to get a lot of tasks done in substantially less time compared to those that are not using AI tools. And if you still don’t believe me, you can kind of look at research that comes out of consulting and law that show that consultants and lawyers that use AI are much more, let’s say, productive. They get work done quicker and submit work of substantially higher quality.\nA lot of this productivity literature also seems to suggest that AI has some differential impacts across skill groups.\nSo a lot of these studies, they disaggregated the impact that AI had on low versus high skilled workers, and all of these studies found that it was low, skilled workers that really benefited a lot more, that they tended to have their performance increase by a lot greater amounts than the high skilled workers, and this kind of finding has a lot of important implications for businesses that are interested in using AI to level their operations.\nNow, this leads to kind of an interesting, existential question, which is really, what does the future hold for the labor force? We don’t have a lot of good data on whether AI as a technology is going to kind of augment or automate jobs.\nBut we can look at data on the expectation that workers have about the impact of AI on organizational workforces.\nAnd you’ll notice that most managers\nare a little bit more pessimistic. They’re predicting that AI is going to decrease the number of employees within organizations. But you’ll notice that the amount that are predicting decreases has actually gone down. So less and less are predicting decreases, which I think is kind of indicative of the fact that\npeople maybe are starting to use AI and are finding that, you know, while it is saving them time, they can in a lot of cases, reinvest that time to kind of do other things that you know. Maybe historically, they would not have been doing\nyou know, it’s not just the case that one or 2 regulatory agencies are thinking about this. It’s really regulatory agencies across the board that are getting involved in this race. So if you’re a business that’s working with AI, you do really need to think about how different organizations might be regulating it.\nthere are certain states here, like California, Utah, Virginia, Maryland that have really been leading the charge, and have passed the most laws and states as a whole, actually have been pretty good on passing laws about how AI could be used in deepfakes for elections, as well as how AI could be used in deepfakes for intimate injury.\nNow, I mentioned how AI is a topic that’s being discussed in kitchen tables across the the the world.\nWhat does public opinion actually say about how people feel about this technology? Well, public opinion says that even though global AI optimism is rising, there are still some fairly deep regional divides that remain so. This chart is looking at the question, do you agree that products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks? And it looks at how people have responded to that question by country. And you can kind of basically see\nhow the answers have varied from 2022 to 2024.\nNow for most countries in the sample, there’s much more kind of AI optimism now than there was before. So more countries are bullish on AI, especially some of the countries that are the most Bullish are countries like France, Germany, and Great Britain, that are historically very negative about the technology.\nNow, still, despite that\nit is countries like China, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia that are just much more optimistic. Nevertheless. So I think we have to wonder, when we look at this, what determines?\nWhy, some countries are more optimistic than others. And how is this optimism going to change over time?\nAnd the thing with some of this optimism is that you can kind of say that you know the fears around the technology they persist to kind of despite data that might tell us that we should be thinking otherwise. So, for example, in the United States, if you look at attitudes that people have towards self driving people in the United States remain very distrustful of self driving cars. This is despite the fact that\nself-driving cars are a lot safer than actual vehicles.\nMoreover, there is also broad support for AI regulation among local Us. Policymakers. So if you look at kind of local Us. Officials and the support they have for government regulation by party year.\nwe’re now at a moment, we’re close to 74% of government officials want to see more AI regulation. That’s pretty massive amounts. And we see these volumes of\ndemand for AI regulation both among the Democrats and the Republicans. Now, it’s 1 thing to want regulation. I think that’s pretty clear in the data. It’s another thing to actually agree on what the right regulation type is the devil’s kind of really in the details here\nthere are some lawmakers that want. For example.\nmore AI reskilling and AI training. And there is other lawmakers that want things like Ubi as a means of accelerating the way in which we could use AI tools. So there’s different ways to kind of be thinking about what can be done and what policy approaches are best.\nYou also can’t talk about AI these days without mentioning the kind of geopolitical race. So the geopolitics of AI has also intensified.\nand\nif you look at the last 2 decades, there have been more models coming from China and the Us.\nAnd then a couple of other countries like Canada and some other European nations. Rounding this out.\nNow with that, said China, is really closing the performance gap. So if you look at the difference in the performance of the top, Us. Versus Chinese models on a benchmark like Lm. Sis.\nChina is also leading when it comes to AI patterns. And this data really kind of illustrates that we’re now at a moment in the ecosystem where the stakes are pretty high with AI, and there’s different kind of geopolitical perspectives about what kind of things need to be done with this technology.\nNow point number 7 is the responsible. AI ecosystem is evolving, but it’s evolving in a rather uneven way. Now, 1st and foremost, I think we want to kind of acknowledge that there’s more reported AI incidents than ever before. So by AI incidents, we’re kind of referring to incidents where there might be kind of ethical misuse of the technology. So, for example.\nthis database that we look at here for the AI index. It’s counted as an instant incident. Occasions where Tesla vehicles have\ndriven improperly with their self driving function. It’s counted as incidents.\nexamples where AI chat bots like character, have encouraged teenagers to commit suicide. It’s counting as incidents examples where\ndeep fakes have been used in election purposes. So that’s an example of what an incident is, and you’ll kind of see quite simply. There are more AI incidents than ever before.\nNow, despite all of this, there are kind of pretty substantial gaps that exist among AI benchmarking. So when it comes to general capability, benchmarks like Mmlu or Gpqa. These are benchmarks that look at for example, how well, these systems are able to do college reasoning. How well they can do scientific reasoning. There’s pretty strong consensus, right? So virtually every single developer is tested on a certain subset of benchmarks.\nWhen you flip the script and you look at benchmarks for responsible AI. These are again benchmarks that are looking at how honest these systems are.\nhow prone they are to hallucinating, how biased they are!\nYou’ll notice there really is no consensus. There are some developers that score their models on some of these benchmarks, others still that don’t.\nAnd this is again dangerous, because we want to move to a world in which there are apples to apples comparisons about\nwhat these systems can and cannot do from responsibility perspectives. And our data suggests that this kind of standardization is still kind of unfortunately lacking.\nNow, academics recently have stepped up. Academics have kind of launched certain benchmarks like helm safety and airbench. These benchmarks are basically trying to\nfind kind of single one shop kind of aggregation scores of what the safest model is. But part of the problem here is that you know these benchmarks are coming out with a frequency that isn’t matching the frequency with which industry is developing these technologies. So\nthe stakes here are a little bit different, and someone has to kind of step up to fill in this gap.\nThere’s also this question that kind of one wonders here about how do businesses feel about responsible? AI. Well, our data suggests that business is still very early on in their Rei journeys. So if you ask, for example, businesses, what are kind of different AI risks that you consider to be relevant versus risks that you’re actively taking steps to mitigate.\nYou’ll notice that these organizations are much more likely to kind of list risks as being relevant than actually taking steps to fundamentally mitigate those risks.\nAnd this is, I think, reflective of the fact that a lot of these organizations are still very early on in their responsibility journeys.\nThe business concerns that organizations have regarding Rei are also changing. So, for example, if you ask organizations, what is the relevance of a selection of responsible AI risks for their organizations. You’ll see that virtually every single risk category has become a lot more salient. But the one category that’s seen the greatest year over year increase has been financial risks.\nSo this is looking at, you know, are you gonna get an Roi with AI.\nIs there kind of other financial associated loss? So you’ll notice here, quite functionally that\nbusinesses are really kind of thinking about this kind of core question of is AI gonna fundamentally drive business value for them.\nWe also see that on responsible AI policymakers are also rising to the occasion. There have been several notable Rei policymaking milestones that have passed in the last year from different organizations like the Council of Europe, the African Union, the G. 7 institutions across the world are really\nunderstanding that AI is is here, and they’re trying to institute the right kind of policies regarding this technology.\nNow, a few more highlights before. I kind of give you guys some time to ask questions, because I want this to be as kind of educational as possible.\nWe kind of see this dual trend here, where, although AI is becoming more accessible, industry is still continuing to lead in the development of this technology.\nso another very important chart from the index. This is looking at\nhow much it costs to use these models across a variety of benchmarks.\nSo you’ll notice, for example, that\ncertain models, if you kind of fix the level of intelligence like Gpt. 3.5,\nit basically costs around $20 per 1 million token. To use a model like this in November of 2022, and that’s now dropped to 7 cents per 1 million tokens. And you see, similarly precipitous drops for other levels of intelligence. So AI is becoming a lot cheaper to use.\nAnd part of the reason that it’s becoming a lot cheaper to use is models are becoming a lot smaller right? So this chart is looking at the size of the largest model that, or sorry the size of the small small that gets above a 60% on Mmlu\nAnd we see better performing models because\nAI systems are becoming more energy efficient and also just getting better price performance from their gpus. So some of the more recent gpus, like the H. 100 and the A. 100, they deliver substantially more performance than some of the earlier ones that have been released.\nWe also see better performing open weight models. So if you kind of juxtapose the performance of the best closed versus open systems. Again, there was a pretty significant gap between. How well the best closed system did versus best open system in January of 2024, that gap has really kind of narrowed down substantially, and there really is not a major difference between the performance of these different types of models.\nNow, despite all of this, industry, is still continuing to race ahead when it comes to AI, there’s more notable AI models that come from industry than virtually any other source, and quite notably in 2024 there were 0 notable AI models produced from academic institutions, and when you zoom out in the last decade. It’s again, these organizations like Google, Meta and Microsoft that are really leading the charge here.\nAnd the simple reason why industry is really in a position to dominate AI is because it just costs a lot of money to train these systems. So you know, in 2017, it cost around $1,000 to train these systems in 2020 to 21. The costs went up to 4 to 6 million, and in the last year we’ve seen costs that range anywhere from 40 to 200 million Us. Dollars. So very substantially high costs\nand\nthe high cost really associated with rising compute costs right, these model developers. They know that if they pump more data into the system they could get substantially better performance. And as a result of doing that you’ve seen as well. That compute needs have also gone through the roof.\nNow I mentioned that AI, as a whole is becoming more accessible. It’s becoming cheaper, you know, it’s worth mentioning, though frontier intelligence is still relatively high. Right? So if you want to access the best in class models.\nthose models tend to be a lot more expensive. For example, April of 2024, the o. 1 model costs around $60 per 1 million tokens to use.\nBut again, it is still cheaper to use a really high quality model now than it was before, and the high quality models now are a lot better. So remember that when Chat Gpt came out\nand Gpt. 3.5, I said, cost around $20 per 1 million tokens to use\ndeep seek. r. 1 is a lot better than Chat Gpt.\nI’d probably say, 7\nnotable kind of developers that are all providing really high caliber AI solutions. And I think it’s interesting to kind of wonder which particular developer is gonna win out in the AI production race.\nNow, I mentioned earlier that industry is leading the charge. I think that’s true.\nAcademics are still pretty well represented when you kind of look at the number of highly cited publications. So it’s, you know, it would be wrong to kind of say that academics are completely\nmisrepresented, but industry is definitely kind of leading the charge.\nWe also have a chapter in the AI Index that looks at trends in AI education. So here we find that although education is expanding, there are still gaps that remain so. For example, at the index, we looked at the availability of computer science education by country. And you’ll notice there’s different levels of availability. There are some countries that really mandate this other countries that don’t mandate it as much. And the levels of availability kind of differ fairly sharply.\nThis is despite the fact that there is more post-secondary graduates in computer science than ever before. And alarmingly, a lot of teachers at the K to 12 level simply don’t really feel equipped to actually teach AI. This is obviously a huge problem, because we need equipped\nleaders like yourself and young students like yourself, with the ability to think about these tools and to kind of use them. Well, now, last, but not least, we find that when it comes to AI there’s still a lot of reasoning challenges that remain so. AI can do a lot of things, but\nit does struggle on tasks like plan bench, which are about kind of measuring how well these systems can plan and kind of reason across different iterations. So there’s a lot of things that AI can do. But it’s important kind of. In conclusion, to mention, there’s a lot of things that AI also cannot do.\nThat concludes my presentation. I mean, I’ve intentionally built in a lot of time for questions, hoping that there was a bit of an active discussion. I will also kind of throw into the Zoom chat the link to the AI index. If you actually want to read\nthe report in its full glory. But it’s very exciting to talk to you guys today. I hope you’ve had a good AI for all session, and happy to kind of field some questions about the report and the work that I do. So thank you very much.\n00:39:04\nThank you so much, Nestor.\nStudents feel free to get off mute at any point, to ask your question, or if you feel more comfortable. You can write it in the chat.\n00:39:18\nHi, can you explain the difference between AI reasoning from like o 1, and the kind of generation that comes from like Gpt. 4.\n00:39:28\nSo, o 1! As I said, it’s like one of these.\ntest time, compute models where, as it is answering a question, it is going to kind of reason, and basically like, break down the reasoning and kind of decompose the reasoning and based on that decomposition further kind of refine its answer. So it takes a lot more time to do, because it’s reasoning a lot more intensely. But it tends to basically answer questions a lot better and more accurately than some of these models like Gpt. For that don’t have that capability.\n00:40:09\nWe have one question in the chat. I’ll read it out loud if the cost for training AI models can be decreased to a reasonable price, so that it is no longer limited to large industries. What would be the larger impact on society.\n00:40:25\nI think it would just make AI research a bit more democratic because I mean.\nyes, these industry sources are providing the models. But at the end of the day. Industry has incentives to kind of build particular types of systems for particular reasons. They need to sell these models, and there might be a lot of good reasons to build AI systems that only kind of academics are well positioned to do so. I feel that\nthis kind of change could really\nlead to a difference in the types of models that are being built and the types of AI research that is kind of pioneered.\n00:41:17\nAnother one in the chat. I’ll read out loud as the net 0 carbon emissions deadline approaches. How have legislators tried to address the environmental impact of AI development while still exploring its potential.\n00:41:31\nYeah, another really good question.\nI mean, this is challenging, because I think there’s 2 sides here where, like on the one side.\nAI takes a lot of energy to train, and the energy to train is kind of associated with the fact that\nyou know this transformer model. It is learning a lot of data representations. And it’s being fed more and more data over time. The more data it needs to kind of learn on the more computational needs it has and the more energy it uses in data centers. Now, with that said data, centers have become a lot more efficient. So the amount of energy that it would have taken to train some of these systems in the past isn’t the case anymore. But the systems are growing in size.\nSo the energy demand is definitely kind of going through the roof.\nNow, on the other hand, AI is now being used a lot more to find ways to kind of save and conserve energy. There is this interesting study, for example, that came from deep Mind, where they basically tried to use AI to modulate the cooling levels of buildings to basically say, like, you know, people want buildings cooled to this temperature and find a way to keep that temperature while kind of optimizing energy usage.\nAnd they’ve basically figured out that they can cool the buildings.\nand in some cases, save, you know, 15 to 20% of energy. So it really is a mixed bag, you know. I think there’s different forces that are at play. I would say that in the short term I think AI is probably going to take a bit more energy, but in the long term, if used correctly, it can really help save a lot of energy as well.\n00:43:13\nAnd what are some of the most surprising trends you have seen in the latest AI index.\n00:43:19\nI think it’s really surprising to see.\nI think, just how much businesses are getting on board. I think that anytime a new technology comes, there can sometimes be a bit of a lag between when businesses actually fully embrace it and fully put themselves in a position to use it. It seems like, really, businesses are quite excited about the tech and are wanting to use it quite a bit. And I think, basically just kind of seeing the pace with which they’ve embraced this technology has been\nvery encouraging and very exciting, to kind of say the least.\n00:43:59\n00:44:08\nNow, a lot of these cases are still in court, and I think fundamentally, it’s going to take time for lawyers to kind of figure out what the law can actually say. And in some cases it’s going to be up to judges to basically kind of make that decision about\nwhat can and cannot be done with these systems. But I think the kind of short answer is, there’s a lot of questions and concerns, but no one really kind of quite knows exactly what the law is saying and how that might kind of shake out. So it’s something that’s really kind of worth keeping an eye on in the near future.\n00:45:12\nThank you. Do you know, if a lot of schools with global or will global apply restrictions of AI at a certain point.\n00:45:23\nYeah, I mean, I think there’s gonna be.\nI think there’s gonna be different rules about how the technology is gonna be used.\nNow, I don’t know what exactly is going to happen, but I think some kind of regulation should be put in place, I think, on several factors. I think one is the fact that.\nyou know, students are inevitably gonna use these tools. And you know, AI could write essays. Well, it could code. Well, it could do a lot of these things.\nand on the one hand, you can’t kind of keep your head in the sand and pretend that these tools aren’t here.\nBut if you want students to learn at a high level, you perhaps have to reimagine new ways of learning to ensure that students can kind of adapt to some of the challenges that these technologies have have created and posited.\nSo I think that’s 1 thing. On the other hand, you know, the technology is here. It’s not going away. And there’s this kind of quote from Eric Brunelsen, one of the steering committee members of the AI Index that I really like, where he says that you know AI is not going to take jobs\naway, but it is going to take away jobs from people that don’t know how to use the tools. So you really need to kind of find ways to use the technology and to kind of understand what it could do. So that there’s that kind of balance where I think educators across the globe. They have to think of the right rules, but make sure that those rules are kind of in keeping with getting students to be on board with the tech and wanting to use the tech well.\n00:46:51\nPerfect. We have a few folks with hands raised so I think, Jasmine, go ahead and go first.st\n00:46:57\nHi, I’m Jasmine and I had a question about AI regulation. That is, do you think like the current regulation on on AI is like keeping up with its development. And what would happen if these like regulations aren’t implemented quick enough.\n00:47:14\nI mean, I think it’s probably not keeping up as quickly as we would want, because AI does develop very quickly. But I do think that relative to other technologies, it’s kept up a little bit more so. I think a parallel that I like to draw is that\nyou know, if you consider 2022 to be the kind of landmark moment for AI.\nWe saw major regulation from Europe with the Euai act as well as Biden’s executive order on AI in 2023.\nSo Regulators have stepped up, but\nif people aren’t trusting the technology, there might be negative effects that come from it, and it might be hard to then get people to embrace it. And I think in kind of landscapes where the regulation is poor. You might have misuses of the technology that are a little bit more prominent. And as a result, there’s going to be less and less trust regarding it. And that’s something that’s kind of quite damaging, and you know, unfortunate.\n00:48:49\nThank you.\n00:48:52\nYeah, I’ll hop back to the chat, and I’ll summarize one of them. What do you see as the real risks if we keep building powerful AI that we can’t fully explain.\n00:49:05\nif AI is put in a position to make a lot of very important decisions like, decide whether you get approved for a loan or decide whether you get into a school or decide whether you get into a job. If we don’t really fully understand the decisions it is making. It can be easy to kind of get disenchanted with these systems to feel that these systems are less and less fair, and to kind of\nbecome a bit bitter about the technology and the role that it’s playing. I mean at Stanford High. I think we fundamentally believe that AI as a technology has the potential to revolutionize the way in which the world is going to work. But if we’re gonna have this technology serve this revolutionary function. We basically need to have everybody get on board with it and what it can do.\nAnd if there’s not enough good regulation, then people might not be as excited, and there might be kind of some negative downstream consequences that flow from that.\n00:50:06\nThank you. Do you think that the development and improvement of AI will plateau anytime in the near future, leaving us with our only remaining area of improvement to be an issue of collection of data.\n00:50:20\nGreat question. I mean, I think that the technology will probably still continue to get better just because there’s a lot of people in industry that are paid a lot of money to continue improving it. I think there’s a fair question to say how much better it’s gonna get. But I think, even if the underlying technology doesn’t improve, I think\nthere’s going to be improvements in business processes and kind of usability that is going to drive a lot of productivity gain. So I mean, historically, it hasn’t always been the introduction of new technologies point blank that has led to massive gains in productivity. It has been more so, the introduction of new technologies, and then the discovery of ways to use and apply that technology. A good example is electricity, right where, when electricity was discovered in the late 19th century.\nit probably took\na good 4, 5 decades before it started having pretty substantial productivity impacts, because what factory owners did is they had steam powered factories, and they would just replace the steam powered factories with electrical ones, and that was marginally better. But it didn’t make a huge difference.\nNow, it took a few decades for people to figure out that if you actually rebuild factories so that it’s based less on a central mode of power operation more decentralized, which you could do with electricity. Then you started to see kind of doubling and tripling of productivity. So I think similarly with AI. You know, the tech, I think, will continue getting better. But even if it’s not going to massively improve.\nif we just kind of\nat some fundamental level find better ways to kind of use it and deploy it. Then I think we could still see a lot of really positive benefits.\n00:52:09\nSammy! Go ahead.\n00:52:13\nOkay. So I had a question about like the actual like AI index report. You know, it’s like, really big. And there’s like so much data in it. Like, what were the challenges you guys faced, you know, with like, actually like collecting the data and like making sure that it was like credible, I guess.\n00:52:30\nYeah, I mean, I think there’s always challenges about vetting it. I think there’s challenges now about what do we actually decide to include? Because there’s just so much things that are happening with AI that it’s hard to know what to include and what not to include. Now. So I think that was a really big challenge that we encountered and that we faced.\nAnd I think also.\nthere’s still some questions that we would like data on where it’s just really challenging to get this information on. For example, you know, we would love to know at the AI Index\nhow much it costs to use some of these systems in different use cases. We don’t have that data. We would love to know, for example, how much businesses are using these tools across different geographies across different functions.\nOkay.\n00:53:39\nFollow up.\nDo you know how much data like? Do you know how many like businesses actively use the AI index report.\n00:53:49\nIt’s a good question. I wouldn’t know. I mean, I like to delude myself and think that it’s millions of thousands, but I mean, we’ve presented to a lot of businesses, you know. I was with Miriam\nin the Middle East\na month or so ago, presenting to some kind of clients for accenture. And they’re kind of development ecosystem there. So there’s definitely a lot of different people that we kind of try to present to and speak to about this technology and what it can do.\n00:54:18\nYeah, one more question in the chat. So specifically, in areas of equity, safety and governance. What trends in the AI index surprised you most.\n00:54:28\nI think it’s probably just that safety, I think, has been a lot less prioritized in the last year, and I think it’s interesting, because I think when AI was 1st launched in 2023, like not 1st launched, AI has been around for a while when Chatgpt came out. I think one of the 1st reactions was, you know, everybody was freaking out. These systems might kill us right? There was a lot of notable AI luminaries that signed this letter being like, we need to pause AI development for the next 6 months.\nYou had the 1st AI safety summit in Bletchley, and it seems like there’s been a you know. I don’t. Wanna.\nI’m a i guess I’m a millennial, and I’m not even sure what generation you kids are. But you know, trying to keep up with the language that you use. There’s been a bit of a vibe shift where it seems like safety has been a lot less prioritized.\nYou know Paris. There was a summit there with AI in February. It was the AI safety summit. 1st it got rechanged to the AI Action Summit. The AI Safety Institute in the Us. Has been rebranded as the AI Innovation Institute. So\nit seems like there’s a bit of kind of a a shift. That’s kind of going on kind of in attitude, and that has a lot of important implications.\n00:55:40\nThank you so much, Nestor students, if you have another question, I think we have like a few more minutes to get it in or feel free to again unmute and just ask.\n00:55:52\nI’ll also leave my email in the chat, just in case any of you guys want to kind of follow up at some point with any other questions.\n00:56:00\nThank you so much.\nPerfect.\nOkay, we did get one question. Do you think the semiconductor boom has partly influenced policies like Trump’s tariffs as a way to encourage more domestic semiconductor production.\n00:56:16\nYeah, I mean, certainly, we obviously need these semiconductors and Gpus to train AI systems. And I think there’s a demand to try to increase the training capabilities and the development capabilities in the Us. But it’s hard to just kind of get that going off the ground in a simple way. So I mean, they’re starting to do that. But it’s gonna take them a while to kind of catch up to Taiwan, and the capabilities that Taiwan has.\n00:56:41\nThank you. And do you think AI will take over research? Will it become independent, like at its own data, to improve itself.\n00:56:50\nI think it’s gonna help research. I still think we’re kind of far away from these like operating AI systems. I think AI is very good at these kind of narrow tasks, like coding copywriting writing, but, like humans, are very good at like flexibly intelligent tasks, and I still think their AI systems are kind of quite far behind.\n00:57:19\n2 more questions come in. Okay. AI models perform well on narrow tasks, but still struggle with complex reasoning. Do you think scaling exists? Architecture. Existing architectures will be enough to solve this? Or will new approaches be needed.\n00:57:36\nI think new approaches will be needed. I think scaling will lead to better systems. But I think that if you look at the human brain. It takes a lot less energy to train us. And we’re substantially more flexible. So there’s clearly kind of some architecture that’s powering us that isn’t represented in the systems, and I think when it’s discovered, it will drive a lot of value. So I do think there has to be new ways of thinking and developing these systems.\n00:58:03\ninequality?\n00:58:13\nGood question. I mean, if you think about AI as something that has a lot of potential to impact productivity and level countries up countries that are leading with AI and kind of imposing it more and working with it more will be much better positioned to kind of use the technology and develop and leverage its advantages. So I think the kind of uneven development can have a lot of impacts. And it’s something to keep an eye on in the future.\n00:58:43\nThank you. We have time for just one more question. If anyone wants to hop off.\noff, hop off mute.\nOkay, I’ll I’ll just read the last one from the chat. At what point, if there is one, is it considered unethical to continue investing in the improvement of AI despite its various impacts. IE, environmentally.\n00:59:05\nI mean, I think this is a hard question for me to answer, because ethics is fundamentally up to the beholder. Right? I think some people there are some people in the AI Safety community that you know really feel. AI is going to kill us all at some point and think that any sort of AI development is unethical or unwise. Other people think that that’s just kind of needless fear mongering. So the question of ethics is a difficult one, but it’s ultimately one for people like you to decide right? I think this kind of speaks to the mandate of the Index.\nYou know. We believe that AI is kind of a human question. We want to give people the data to answer those questions as well.\n00:59:42\nThank you so much, Nestor, for your time, and answering all of these really amazing questions from the students. I really appreciate it, and thank you for sharing your email. Everybody give a electronic round of applause for Nestor.\n00:59:55\nThank you guys for having me. It was great to speak with you.\n01:00:00\nThank you. Everybody. Have a good day. Goodbye.\n01:00:04\nAnd just quickly, before we all sign off here we are going to head into our reflection sessions. We are reaching the halfway point of the program already. And at this point we ask students to just give their feedback in the form of a mid program survey. So I’m going to put that link inside the chat.\nand the end of the day tomorrow, and then also, I’ll put in the chat the links to the reflection sessions\nwhich are next. And for today’s reflection sessions. You started in your workshop session this morning, or, you know, depending on where you are in the world. Earlier today, you started talking about your projects and the problems that your projects are addressing. So in reflection sessions today, you’re going to continue that conversation in your new groups\nand present, if you will, some of your thoughts around the discussion that you had from your earlier conversations with your teams. So I’ll go ahead and drop the reflection session links into the chat.\nYour sessions begin in about 9 min. So take your time again. You can complete the survey if you’d like, and then your mentors will see you in your reflection sessions at 2, 10,\nor 10 after the hour.\nThank you so much, and let us know if you have any questions.\n"},"03_resources/Net-Asset-Value-(NAV)-Definition,-Formula,-Example,-and-Uses":{"title":"Net Asset Value (NAV): Definition, Formula, Example, and Uses","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nNet Asset Value (NAV) is the difference between an investment fund’s assets and liabilities, calculated daily. NAV per share is this value divided by outstanding shares, primarily used for mutual funds and unit investment trusts to determine their trading price. The article explains its calculation, provides an example, differentiates its application in open-end versus closed-end funds, and clarifies that changes in NAV alone are not the best measure of fund performance due to distributions.\nKey Points\n\nNAV is the value of an investment fund, calculated as assets minus liabilities.\nNAV per share is NAV divided by the total number of outstanding shares.\nIt is most commonly used for mutual funds and unit investment trusts.\nNAV is calculated at the end of each business day using closing market prices.\nOpen-end funds (most mutual funds) trade at their NAV, while closed-end funds and ETFs can trade at prices different from their NAV on exchanges.\nChanges in NAV alone are not the best indicator of a mutual fund’s performance because distributions (dividends, capital gains) decrease NAV.\nBetter measures of fund performance include annual total return and compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).\nNAV is based on tangible assets, unlike shareholder equity which includes intangible assets.\n\n\nwww.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp\nOriginal Content\n\nWhat Is Net Asset Value?\nNet asset value (NAV) is the value of an investment fund that’s determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. The fund’s per-share NAV is then obtained by dividing NAV by the number of shares outstanding.\nPer-share NAV is most commonly used with a mutual fund or unit investment trusts. It’s the price at which the shares of the funds registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) trade. NAV can change daily. Per-share NAV can therefore change as well.\n\nInvestopedia / Nez Riaz\nHow Net Asset Value Works\nThe difference between assets and liabilities for companies and business entities is known as the net assets, the net worth, or the capital of the company. NAV is also applied to fund valuation and pricing.\nA fund’s per-share NAV makes pricing easy for investors to understand so it’s used to value and conduct the buying and selling of a fund’s shares.\nNAV per individual share is often close to or equal to the book value per share of a business. Companies that are considered to have high growth prospects are traditionally valued more than NAV might suggest. Per-share NAV for closed-end funds is frequently compared to the stock price or market value per share to find undervalued or overvalued investments.\nNAV Formula\nNAV = Assets - Liabilities\nNAV per share = (Assets - Liabilities) / Total number of outstanding shares\nNAV Example\nLet’s look at a calculation for the per-share NAV of a mutual fund. Assume that the fund has $100 million worth of investments in different securities, a figure that’s calculated from the day’s closing prices for each security.\nIt also has 7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, 4 million in total receivables, and accrued income for the day of 75,000. The fund has 13 million in short-term liabilities and 2 million in long-term liabilities. Accrued expenses for the day are 10,000.\nThe fund has 5 million shares outstanding.\n1. To determine per-share NAV, first calculate the fund’s NAV:\nTotal assets are:\n100,000,000 + 7,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 75,000, or $111,075,000\nTotal liabilities are:\n13,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 10,000, or 15,010,000\nNAV = 111,075,000 - 15,010,000, or $96,065,000\n2. Next, calculate per-share NAV:\nPer-share NAV = 96,065,000 / 5,000,000, or 19.21\nImportant\nThe actual purchase price that investors pay for mutual fund shares would be the per-share NAV plus related fees such as sales loads. The amount they receive when redeeming shares would be the per-share NAV less related fees such as redemption fees.\nMutual Funds and NAV\nMutual funds collect money from a large number of investors. They then use that money to invest in securities such as stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Each investor gets a specified number of shares in proportion to their invested amount. The pricing of each share is based on NAV.\nMutual fund pricing is typically calculated based on the daily closing prices of the securities in the fund, unlike a stock whose price changes are posted throughout the day.\nManagers of a mutual fund compute the closing price of all the securities within its portfolio at the end of the trading day. They add the value of any additional assets, account for liabilities, and calculate NAV. They also calculate the per-share NAV using NAV and the number of outstanding shares.\nClosed-End vs. Open-End Funds NAV\nAn open-end fund can issue an unlimited number of shares, doesn’t trade on exchanges, and is priced each day at the close of trading using its NAV. Most mutual funds such as those in 401k plans are open-end funds.\nClosed-end funds are listed on a stock exchange. They trade similarly to securities and can trade at a price that’s not equal to their NAV.ETFs trade like stocks and their market value can differ from their actual NAV. This allows for profitable trading opportunities for active ETF traders who can spot timely opportunities.\nETFs also calculate their NAV daily at the close of the market for reporting purposes similar to mutual funds. They also calculate and disseminate intraday NAV multiple times per minute in real-time, however.\nNAV and Fund Performance\nFund investors often try to assess the performance of a mutual fund based on their NAV differentials between two dates. An investor might compare the NAV on Jan. 1 to the NAV on Dec. 31 and see the difference in the two values as a gauge of the fund’s performance. Changes in NAV between two dates aren’t the best representation of mutual fund performance, however.\nMutual funds commonly pay out all their income like dividends and interest earned to their shareholders. Mutual funds are additionally obligated to distribute the accumulated realized capital gains to the shareholders.\nThe NAV decreases accordingly as these two components of income and gains are regularly paid out. A mutual fund investor earns income and returns but individual earnings aren’t reflected in the absolute NAV values when compared between two dates.\nA reliable measure of mutual fund performance is the annual total return which is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Investors and analysts also look at compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) which represents the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period longer than one year.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Mutual Fund NAV and Book Value Per Common Share?\nThe book value per common share reflects an analysis of the price of a share of stock of an individual company. NAV reflects the total value of a mutual fund after subtracting its liabilities from its assets.\nWhat Are the Trading Timelines for NAV?\nNAV is computed and reported as of a particular business date but all the buy and sell orders for mutual funds are processed at the per-share NAV on their trade dates. Buy and sell orders received before 1:30 p.m. on a particular day will be executed at the per-share NAV determined on that day if regulators mandate a cutoff time of 1:30 p.m. Any orders received after the cutoff time will be executed at the per-share NAV of the next business day.\nThe Bottom Line\nNet asset value (NAV) is the value of an investment fund that’s determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. Per-share NAV is calculated by dividing NAV by the number of shares outstanding. Funds can be open or closed and the pricing of each share is based on NAV.\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestor.gov. ” Net Asset Value.”\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ” Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – A Guide for Investors.”\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. ” Opening Up About Closed-End Funds.”\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ” Mutual Funds and ETFs: A Guide for Investors.” Page 22.\n"},"03_resources/Not-all-AI-assisted-programming-is-vibe-coding-(but-vibe-coding-rocks)":{"title":"Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks)","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe article clarifies that \\“vibe coding,\\” a term coined by Andrej Karpathy, refers specifically to using LLMs to generate code without reviewing or understanding it, typically for low-stakes, throwaway projects. The author emphasizes that this is distinct from responsible AI-assisted programming, where developers thoroughly review and comprehend the generated code.

The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured in the New York Times, Ars Technica, the Guardian and countless online discussions.\nI’m concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent. I’m seeing people apply the term “vibe coding” to all forms of code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the term and gives a false impression of what’s possible with responsible .\nVibe coding is not the same thing as writing code with the help of LLMs!\nTo quote Andrej’s original tweet in full (with my emphasis added):\n\nThere’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.\nI ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.\nIt’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.\n\nI love this definition. Andrej is an extremely talented and experienced programmer—he has no need for AI assistance at all. He’s using LLMs like this because it’s fun to try out wild new ideas, and the speed at which an LLM can produce code is an order of magnitude faster than even the most skilled human programmers. For low stakes projects and prototypes why not just let it rip?\nWhen I talk about vibe coding I mean building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes.\nUsing LLMs for code responsibly is not vibe coding\nLet’s contrast this “forget that the code even exists” approach to how professional software developers use LLMs.\nThe job of a software developer is not (just) to churn out code and features. We need to create code that demonstrably works, and can be understood by other humans (and machines), and that will support continued development in the future.\nWe need to consider performance, accessibility, security, maintainability, cost efficiency. Software engineering is all about trade-offs—our job is to pick from dozens of potential solutions by balancing all manner of requirements, both explicit and implied.\nWe also need to read the code. My golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won’t commit any code to my repository if I couldn’t explain exactly what it does to somebody else.\nIf an LLM wrote the code for you, and you then reviewed it, tested it thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone else that’s not vibe coding, it’s software development. The usage of an LLM to support that activity is immaterial.\nI wrote extensively about my own process in Here’s how I use LLMs to help me write code. Vibe coding only describes a small subset of my approach.\nLet’s not lose track of what makes vibe coding special\nI don’t want “vibe coding” to become a negative term that’s synonymous with irresponsible AI-assisted programming either. This weird new shape of programming has so much to offer the world!\nI believe everyone deserves the ability to automate tedious tasks in their lives with computers. You shouldn’t need a computer science degree or programming bootcamp in order to get computers to do extremely specific tasks for you.\nIf vibe coding grants millions of new people the ability to build their own custom tools, I could not be happier about it.\nSome of those people will get bitten by the programming bug and go on to become proficient software developers. One of the biggest barriers to that profession is the incredibly steep initial learning curve—vibe coding shaves that initial barrier down to almost flat.\nVibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I’ve talked before about how using LLMs for code is difficult —figuring out what does and doesn’t work is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.\nI think vibe coding is the best tool we have to help experienced developers build that intuition as to what LLMs can and cannot do for them. I’ve published more than 80 experiments I built with vibe coding and I’ve learned so much along the way. I would encourage any other developer, no matter their skill level, to try the same.\nWhen is it OK to vibe code?\nIf you’re an experienced engineer this is likely obvious to you already, so I’m writing this section for people who are just getting started building software.\n\nProjects should be low stakes. Think about how much harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed—damaged reputation, lost money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to build software that will be used by other people!\nConsider security. This is a really difficult one—security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:\n\nWatch out for secrets —anything that looks similar in shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool. If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works!\nThink about data privacy. If you are building a tool that has access to private data—anything you wouldn’t want to display to the world in a screen-sharing session—approach with caution. It’s possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that data might leave your machine.\n\n\nBe a good network citizen. Anything that makes requests out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on those services. This is a reason I like —their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm elsewhere.\nIs your money on the line? I’ve seen horror stories about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful about using vibe coding against anything that’s charged based on usage.\n\nIf you’re going to vibe code anything that might be used by other people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe check (hah) before you share it with the world.\nHow do we make vibe coding better?\nI think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be solved here.\nSafe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a sandbox. Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is restricted to running in a locked down &lt;iframe&gt;, can load only approved libraries and can’t make any network requests to other sites.\nThis makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do—you can’t use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts against an LLM.\nOther popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.\nThere’s plenty of room for innovation in this space. I’m hoping to see a cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom tools as productively and safely as possible.\nGo forth and vibe code\nI really don’t want to discourage people who are new to software from trying out vibe coding. The best way to learn anything is to build a project!\nFor experienced programmers this is an amazing way to start developing an intuition for what LLMs can and can’t do. For beginners there’s no better way to open your eyes to what’s possible to achieve with code itself.\nBut please, don’t confuse vibe coding with all other uses of LLMs for code.\nPart of series How I use LLMs and ChatGPT\n\nPrompts.js - Dec. 7, 2024, 8:35 p.m.\nBuilding Python tools with a one-shot prompt using uv run and Claude Projects - Dec. 19, 2024, 7 a.m.\nHere’s how I use LLMs to help me write code - March 11, 2025, 2:09 p.m.\nNot all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks) - March 19, 2025, 5:57 p.m.\nAI assisted search-based research actually works now - April 21, 2025, 12:57 p.m.\nI really don’t like ChatGPT’s new memory dossier - May 21, 2025, 2:38 p.m.\nTips on prompting ChatGPT for UK technology secretary Peter Kyle - June 3, 2025, 7:08 p.m.\n\nNext:Calling a wrap on my weeknotes\nPrevious:Adding AI-generated descriptions to my tools collection"},"03_resources/Obsidian-Web-Clipper":{"title":"Obsidian Web Clipper","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Save the web.\nHighlight and capture web pages in your favorite browser.

It works by minimizing the error between a desired setpoint and the current output of a system (plant) by adjusting an input variable. The control output is a sum of three components: Proportional (P) which reacts to the current error, Integral (I) which accounts for accumulated past errors, and Derivative (D) which responds to the rate of change of the error. The document provides examples of how to implement a PID controller using Road Runner’s PIDFController in Java and Kotlin, and discusses the crucial process of tuning the kP, kI, and kD gains to achieve stable and accurate system response, addressing common issues like steady-state error and integral windup.\nKey Points\n\nPID Control is a popular and effective method for controlling actuators in robotics.\nIt is a feedback control system that aims to minimize the error between a desired setpoint and the actual output.\nThe control output is composed of three terms:\n\nProportional (P): Directly proportional to the current error.\nIntegral (I): Sums past errors to eliminate steady-state error.\nDerivative (D): Measures the rate of change of error to dampen oscillations.\n\n\nThe total control input is u=k_p⋅e+k_i∫e dt+k_d\\\\frac{de}{dt}.\nRoad Runner provides PIDFController for implementation (Java/Kotlin examples given).\nTuning the k_P, k_I, and k_D gains is crucial and often done manually.\nP gain: Increases aggressiveness; can cause oscillation.\nI gain: Addresses steady-state error; can lead to integral windup if not managed.\nD gain: Dampens oscillations, improves stability.\nIntegral windup can be mitigated by capping/decaying the integral sum or restricting its action.\nThe Ziegler-Nichols method is a semi-automated tuning approach.\n\n\nrr.brott.dev/docs/v0-5/tour/pid-control/\nOriginal Content\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control is an extremely popular method for controlling various actuators on hobbyist and industrial robots alike. Its popularity is due both to its simplicity and effectiveness for a wide range of systems. As such, it is an important stepping stone to more sophisticated techniques.\nBasics\nBefore we dive into the mechanics of PID, it is useful to define some terminology. Every control problem arises from a real world mechanism or system with inputs and outputs. These systems are often referred to as plants. While a particular system may have multiple inputs and outputs, we will restrict our attention to single-input, single-output (SISO) plants. In this context, the objective of PID control is to adjust the input variable to yield the desired output (often called the setpoint). PID control is a form of feedback control which uses measurements of the output to determine the input (we’ll see the complementary technique of feedforward control in the next section). This is accomplished by minimizing error—the difference between the current output and the setpoint.\nTo see this in action, consider the problem of controlling the position of a linear slide actuated by a spool attached to a motor. In this example, the linear slide system is the plant, the single input is the motor voltage, and the single output is the linear slide position.\n\nAs a matter of convention, the variables should be defined so that an increase in the input variable results in an increase in the output variable.\n\nAs the acronym suggests, the output of a PID controller is composed of three distinct components. The proportional term produces a control input in direct proportion to the error signal. That is, if the error doubles, the control input will also double. Mathematically, this is expressed by the equation u = k_p \\cdot e where u is the control input, k_p is the proportional gain, and e = x_{setpoint} - x is the error. The proportional gain is a tunable parameter that determines the aggressiveness of the control action. More on tuning at the end of this page.\nWhile purely proportional (P) control is sometimes sufficient, it is not capable of handling every plant. To supplement it, one can use integral (I) control, derivative (D) control, or a combination of both. The integral term maintains a sum of the past errors which allows compounded small errors to accumulate into bigger errors. The derivative term measures the change in error to mitigate rapid fluctuations in the control input. To compute the total response, simply add the individual ones together: u = k_p \\cdot e + k_i \\int e \\, dt + k_d \\frac{de}{dt} .\nWith Road Runner, all of this is conveniently packaged in PIDFController (yes, there is indeed an F for feedforward—more about that in the next section).\n\nFor some situations, the input variable wraps around (e.g., IMU heading). To prevent discontinuities in the error computations, use PIDFController.setInputBounds():\n\nTuning\nThe real art of PID control is tuning the gains. This is traditionally done manually using a graph of the error over time or observing the plant’s behavior directly. Typically, one starts with a pure P loop. With a high enough gain, the output should oscillate around the setpoint. If the controller is unable to reach the setpoint over a long period of time (this is called steady-state error), it may help to add more integral action. This is often the case with static friction or significant inertia relative to the actuator force. Once the oscillations are centered around the setpoint, increasing the derivative gain can dampen the oscillations while still reaching the setpoint in the same amount of time.\n\nBe careful when adding integral action to your controller. Without proper countermeasures, the response can easily become unstable with violent oscillations of increasing amplitude. This problem is often referred to as integral windup and can be mitigated by one or more of the approaches below:\n\nCapping the integral sum\nDecaying the integral sum over time\nRestricting integral action to a certain band around the setpoint\n\nHowever, as we will see, a better solution is to determine the cause of the steady-state error and to integrate that knowledge into the controller with additional feedforward terms.\n\nHere’s a chart summarizing the effects of each gain on the response:\n\nIf you want a semi-automated approach to tuning, check out the Ziegler-Nichols method."},"03_resources/Peter-Norvig-Pres---Stochastic-parrots-are-much-more-sophisticated":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nPeter Norvig, an \\“AI hipster,\\” discusses the evolution, current state, and future of AI. He begins by comparing AI’s learning capabilities to simple organisms and highlights the key difference from traditional software: AI handles problems without definitive answers and learns by being shown rather than told. He emphasizes the profound impact of written language on AI development, noting the unexpected power of simply “dumping text” into models for self-learning through word prediction tasks.\nNorvig explains that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, while sometimes dismissed as \\“stochastic parrots,\\” are much more sophisticated. He argues they generalize, form concepts, employ selective attention, and reason, going beyond mere echoing. He delves into how AI represents the world by generalizing from compressed information (written text) into neural networks, enabling it to answer questions and even write programs. He clarifies GPT as both \\“Generative Pre-trained Transformer\\” (AI term) and \\“General Purpose Technology\\” (economist term), stressing AI’s new ability to perform diverse, unforeseen tasks.\nLooking to the future, Norvig discusses the rapid pace of AI advancement, cautioning about the societal impact, particularly job displacement, and the need for ethical considerations and societal safety nets. He provides examples of AI’s promise in fields like medicine, cybersecurity, agriculture, education, and mathematics, where it is already achieving breakthroughs previously thought impossible. He concludes by stressing the importance of defining clear objectives for AI, comparing it to the philosophical challenge of knowing \\“what you need\\” versus \\“what you want,\\” and advocating for safeguards like \\“undo buttons\\” and “Are you sure?” prompts in AI systems.\nKey Points\n\nAI vs. Traditional Software: AI tackles problems with no definitive answers and learns by being shown, not told.\nLearning in Language Models: AI learns by processing vast amounts of text, self-testing by predicting blanked-out words, which enables learning syntax, facts, and even arithmetic.\nBeyond \\“Stochastic Parrots\\”: Norvig argues that AI systems generalize, form concepts, exhibit selective attention, and reason, demonstrating capabilities beyond simple echoing.\nGPT: Stands for \\“Generative Pre-trained Transformer\\” (AI) and functions as a \\“General Purpose Technology\\” (economics), capable of diverse and unforeseen tasks.\nPromise and Peril: AI offers tremendous potential in fields like medicine, education, and science, but also poses risks like job displacement and unintended consequences, requiring careful societal management and ethical objective-setting.\nCurrent Focus: Norvig is actively involved in applying AI to education, particularly in developing personalized, mastery-based tutoring systems.\nClassical AI Relevance: Traditional AI techniques (e.g., search algorithms in AlphaGo) remain crucial when combined with modern deep learning for achieving breakthrough results.\nImpact: His most rewarding work has been contributing to Google Search, impacting billions of users globally.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/9jeyCdKRcyMpL6_WxLSuHVMMirZujtmLgDARDBxQw-a14rMAsm7BK0WTXIt8PkT24QkUAnJBoxTFvXCq.yWYlwqYZ3KOM2O7W%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2Fvzh2w03e-cNERc8PotJd43Y8NlclvylTMfnAQAiJsMbpWQY_Q-fLn7UvjPsj-HtV.cEYVYOP03B12gbfy\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\nField I’ve been in for a long time, uh, so, you know, I’m a… I’m an AI hipster. I was doing it before it was cool.\n00:00:05 / 00:47:33\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:02\nOf the\nand let’s go way back to the past. Let’s go back 20 million years ago, and here are these little sea elegans worms. They’re about a millimeter long, and we’ve mapped out their nervous systems. And they have, unless they’re unusual. They have exactly 302 neurons. And we kind of know what it does.\nAnd these things they swim around, they observe their environment, they can go towards food. They can go away from predators and so on. And they can basically learn what makes them successful by applying this nervous system in the right way.\nSo that’s really interesting that that they can do that. They have that capability, even though they’re so simple.\nNow.\nhere’s an organism that’s even simpler sunflowers. They have no neurons, but they, too, can observe their environment and change their behavior in order to improve themselves right? So they face towards the sun. And when the sun moves, they move. They’re not making a conscious decision, but just kind of the way they’re built and the chemistry inside their cells kind of forces them to turn towards the sun.\nAnd so it’s it’s all observing the environment and interacting with it.\nNow, in the present.\nwe have human brains, and they’ve evolved quite a bit from these smaller animals from millions of years ago, and they have about a hundred 1 billion neurons in our brains.\nCoincidentally, these large AI programs also have somewhere in the range of 100 billion parameters, and we call them neural nets. I wish we wouldn’t do that, because yes, in some ways they’re similar to brains. They’re observing the environment, making decisions and and trying to improve themselves. But in other ways it’s really completely different.\nSorry. Roxy’s in the background there somebody walked by the house.\nSo what’s different about AI software versus the regular kind of software that that we’ve always had.\nAnd to me, one of the key things is to look at what are the difficulties? What makes software hard and for regular software? The problem is complexity. If I want to write the software for a bank. There’s like thousands of different regulations and taxes and fees. And I got to get everyone exactly right. But there is a correct answer down to the penny. And I can know when I have it right\nfor most AI problems. It’s just not like that. So an AI problem is here I show you this picture of an eye. Is it normal, or is it diseased? And there isn’t a definitive answer. Even expert doctors might disagree on this. But yet we’re asking AI systems to make these hard choices. And that’s really different from the way we use software in the past.\nThen another thing is that we build these systems by showing them rather than telling them. So. Here’s a picture of me with one of my 1st teachers, my mom. And she’s showing me something. And on the right we have a picture of of how we do traditional software by telling it step by step, every single thing rather than having it be flexible and learn on its own. So that’s what’s different about AI.\nNow\nlet’s go back again into the past. About 5,000 years ago, humans developed writing. And that’s really has made all the difference to me. This is the most amazing technology we’ve ever developed, far, far more amazing and useful than computers and electronics and cars and everything else. Because writing is what allows our civilization to advance from one generation to the next.\nAnd yeah, spoken language. That was pretty important, too, and that allowed us to build up a civilization and and go from just small tribes to having cities, and so on and cooperating with each other, but it’s the written language that allows us to pass it down from one generation to the next and improve on it.\nAnd AI has taken advantage of that. So how do we take advantage of that? So\nyou know I want to go back in time again to when I was your age, and I was in high school. And\nwe had a computer class in my high school was actually was unusual at that time. Most high schools didn’t, and we also had a class in linguistics, and that was unusual, and I took both those classes, and I said to my teachers, you know. It seems like there’s something in common here between the way you talk to a computer and what’s going on in linguistics and learning the rules of syntax, and so on. Could I put those 2 together?\nAnd at the time my teacher says, Yeah, that seems really interesting. We don’t know enough to tell you how to do that. But good luck! And that’s sort of what I spent the rest of my career doing, and I always thought\nas I was getting into this, that it’s really interesting to figure out what the words on the page are when you’re reading a book or reading a file, or whatever, and that there’s something really interesting going on there. But I always thought that the harder part would be figuring out what’s going on inside the head of the reader as you’re looking at the words. So yeah, some information is in the words.\nbut I thought more was going on inside the head, and that’s what the hard part about doing AI would be.\nAnd then\nwe wanted to transfer that to say, could we take a bunch of text and then put it into the head of the computer. And we thought, we’re really going to have to tell it, the computer what to do step by step. It’s not enough to just dump the text. In.\nTurns out I was mostly wrong, and that it is enough to just dump the text in. So there’s far more of what’s actually happening in the world\ngets encoded into the text than what we originally thought. And that’s, I think, been the biggest surprise of the last 5 years.\nSo how does AI work?\nAnd for these language models the way it works is just by pouring in a bunch of text and then having it, observe that text and improve itself. So how do you do that? Well, you want to give it tests, and then have it get them right or wrong.\nand you could have you know the way you guys are tested in school. You could have exams. Some teacher could make up the questions, but that’s too hard and slow. It’s hard work on the part of a teacher. So instead, what we do is we use the text itself to make up its own problems. And what we do is we feed in a text. But we blank out one word at a time\nand ask the computer to guess what that word is right. So we show it a sentence with a missing word and have it. Guess what that word is if it gets it right, we say, do more like that. If it gets it wrong, we say, modify yourself so that you’re more likely to get it right next time, and that’s all we do. And every single word is a potential text. And you just do that billions and billions and billions of of test problems. And it keeps getting better.\nSo that doesn’t seem like much. What can you do just by learning? By blanking out one word at a time? Well, it turns out you can learn a lot.\nso you can start learning the syntax of a language such as English, right? So by blanking out the A and then blanking out the, and you eventually learn that we use a between before a word that starts with a consonant sound, and we use, and before a noun that starts with a vowel sound, and we learn that part of syntax, and we can learn all the rest of the syntax as well.\nBut it’s more than that we can learn geography by by looking at the words there, and if you guess, is it to the east, or is it to the West? You get it wrong next time you’re more likely to get it right.\nWe can learn arithmetic. We can learn the conversion factor between kilometers and miles from this one example, you couldn’t learn that. But after it sees thousands of examples, starts to figure out how that conversion factor works. And now multiplication and division works. So all that is done just by giving it tests of blanking out one word at a time and asking it to get the right answer.\nNow, once we have that we have what’s called a language model, and things like Chat gpt, we call them language models, and that’s come to have kind of a general meaning, but it actually has a very specific scientific meaning, and that language model\nis a probability distribution of what’s the most probable. Next word given what you showed me so far, and that’s all we mean by language model. But then we make the language model smarter by what we call adaptation.\nby going through and doing things like saying, well, we’re going to give you a specific prompt that’s going to make you do better. We’re going to. Yes, we had you automatically learn from examples step by step. But we’re also going to put some humans in the loop to help you learn and learn from their smart judgment, and so on, and so on. There’s a bunch of a dozen or\nso strategies we use to make the system better. But most of it comes just from self-learning.\nThen we want the systems to be smarter than than just doing an answer. And\none of the things we do is we teach it to be smarter in the way it responds. So if you just ask it, here’s a question, what’s the answer? Sometimes it gets a right, sometimes it gets it wrong if you, if you remind it. Well, think through. Sort of, you know. Sometimes you’re asked on your test. Show your work when you’re doing a math problem. If you remind these AI systems to show their work and work it out, then they do better\nyou can allow them to use tools. Allow them to call programs or access external databases. You can have multiple AI systems communicate with each other and and maybe vote on on what result is best, and maybe even call in some humans for help when they need them. You can personalize it to to my needs or your needs, and you can specialize it.\nsave you by the system.\nJust for medical condition.\nLet me see if I can let Roxy out, so she’ll calm down.\nOkay, we’re back now\none of my colleagues, Emily Bender and and her co-authors wrote this paper that says, Well, maybe we shouldn’t be so impressed by these language models. Maybe they’re just what she called stochastic parrots, which says all they’re doing is just echoing back what they learned. Now, I don’t really like that phrase. For one thing.\nI think this is unnecessarily mean to parrots. I think parrots are really cool and really smart. So calling someone a parrot. That shouldn’t be an insult. But the other is, I think it’s it’s not really getting at what’s going on here.\nAnd to emphasize that, let’s try this little exercise. You can all do this on your own so complete this poem.\nRoses are red, violets are blue.\nI’m a stochastic parrot, and so\nblank blank. And if you got, are you? Then maybe you are right. So maybe what we’re doing a lot of times is just completing what obviously comes next, and maybe that’s not so different than what the computers are doing. Now, if\nif the computer models were just this language model just saying, given a sequence of words. What’s the most probable next word? Then I would agree that that’s not very interesting, that’s a stochastic parrot, or whatever you want to call it. But they’re doing much more than that.\nwhat was the previous word, but pay attention to the important stuff and forget the unimportant stuff.\nThey can consider different alternatives and weigh them against each other, and and reason say, well, 1st I had this idea, but then I found some evidence against it, and I went with another idea. So to me they’re doing much more than just echoing. I think that’s important.\nOkay.\nNow, another thing that I think is important is the way they represent the world and come to make good generalizations. So so this schematic chart says, we start with a world in which lots of complicated stuff is happening.\nand our computers don’t have complete access to that whole world. Most of what we have is compressed down into what’s written.\nand that good step is important, because authors decided what was important, and wrote that down and didn’t write down the important stuff. So we’ve gained a lot by saying we’re going to try to learn what other people thought were important, what teachers thought we should know.\nAnd then we encode it further into this neural network inside the computer. And\nit can’t memorize everything in all those books, so instead of memorizing, it has to generalize, and in order to generalize, it’s got to say, well, what’s important about what I read, and let’s represent that rather than try to memorize every single word. Let’s get the gist of what was important, and that’s what’s encoded into our networks, and then we ask it a question, and it comes up with an answer.\nand it’s got to do some reasoning in between.\nAnd sometimes it does that by coming up with an answer. That’s an English paragraph. And in order to do that, it’s got to figure out what’s important. Sometimes it does that with a more formal language. So you can ask it to solve a programming problem. And it comes up, writes a program, and then it can run it. And that’s really useful. By using these other languages like programming languages.\nyou can actually run the program and see if it’s right or wrong.\nSo it’s using these external tools. And I think that’s important.\nNo.\nSo you’re probably all familiar with Chat Gpt, you wonder what does just Gpt mean? And in AI it means generative free train transformer. So generative means it can come up with something new. It can invent a new paragraph rather than what we, the alternative to that is called discriminative. So, like an email, spam filter is\ndiscriminative. It can say, this is spam. It goes into the spam inbox. This is good. It goes into your inbox, but it couldn’t generate a spam message. Pre trained means. We give it all this text ahead of time and train it, and transformer means it.\nIt transforms the input into an output. But I think it’s also interesting that economists\nhave before Chat Gpt. They had an abbreviation Gpt which they call general purpose technology. And for them it’s things like electricity is a general purpose technology. It doesn’t just help us do one thing. It helps do lots and lots of things. And that’s, I think what’s really interesting about these systems is that they do lots of different things. And that’s new.\nWe used to write software to do just one thing at a time. And now we have software that can do lots of things, including things that the authors of the software never thought of. So that’s a big change.\nIn 1958, Herb Simons, one of the founders of the field of AI Nobel Prize winner. It was great excitement for me to be able to to meet him earlier before he died in 1958, he said, well, we’re just starting to get these AI systems. And he said, they’re now in the world machines that think.\nAnd we sort of changed what we thought computers were good for, because back in 1958, we thought they were just like calculators. Right? You give them some numbers. And something comes out. And he started to deal with programs that could solve logic problems and so on. And that was new.\nAnd now we have Sam Altman saying, AI will be a reality in 5 years. People argue about that. When exactly, is that coming? What exactly does it mean? I would rather not have a term like General AI. I would rather say, well, AI is going to be good at some things, and not so good at other things, and some things we shouldn’t even bother trying to do with it. So it’s not like there’s 1\nsecond when you achieve this. But rather, I say, it’s going to become more and more useful for lots of different things, and we better be careful about how we apply it in just the right way.\nSo, as Spiderman says, with great power comes great responsibility. So we want to use this right.\nAnd in all technologies we have to worry about unintended consequences.\nSo automobiles was a great invention. Right? We can distribute food and and everything else to people in a way that we never could before made everybody’s standard of living better, but also has a lot of bad consequences, like air pollution and traffic and traffic injuries, and so on.\nAnd then there’s also intended destruction. So the airplane was a great invention that opened up the world, but it also allowed for the possibility of bombing cities in a way that was far more destructive than before. The invention of airplanes.\nThis was an interesting article from foreign policy which looked at AI and looked at the promise and the peril. And I think that’s a good way to look at it. We have to say\nthere’s awesome things we can do with this technology. But we also have to worry about the risk and deal with that.\nSo here’s an example of inventing a plant that has a disease resistant protein in it.\nWe couldn’t do that with just what we knew about chemistry. But with AI systems we’re able to understand these things in a way we couldn’t before. And we’re inventing all these new types of chemistry and so on. And I’m just going through a few examples that came up just like in the last week. Here’s a company that talked about healthcare for aging people. There wasn’t a nice advance in cyber security.\nAnd yeah, AI can be used by the bad guys in cybersecurity as well as by the good guys. I think I’m now convinced that it’s going to be more useful for the good guys. So I’m optimistic here. I’ve seen half a dozen companies that are talking about. Well, we’re going to fly drones to do agriculture better analyzing them with AI,\na bunch of companies doing education, saying, we can communicate with students better. And we can help the teachers do a better job by concentrating on what what they can do best and have the AI do what it can do best.\nNow, this was not from the last month. This is like a year ago. But I think this is really interesting, and this field continues to move right? So using AI for mathematics, and there’s a part of mathematics that just wrote. You follow out the formulas. But there’s a part that’s creative and real. Mathematicians\nhave to come up with something brand new, and it used to be that they were on their own to do that. But now it seems like AI is really helping\nand here’s an example of Deepmind’s alpha proof, which says, I’m going to take an informal problem\nthe way you know, a mathematician states it kind of in a combination of English and mathematical formulas that are Gonna make it into a formal problem and use the AI to solve it.\nAnd Timothy Gowers, one of the top mathematicians, says the fact that the program came up with a non-obvious construction is very impressive. Well, beyond what I thought was possible. So in the last year this has all changed. This has all become possible.\nOpenai has done this. Terrence Tao, another famous mathematician, said the same kind of things that it’s now doing, stuff that I never thought was possible before. And here, in the middle, he says, the experience seems roughly on a par with trying to devise trying to advise a mediocre but not completely incompetent graduate student.\nand he says, this is brand new. A year before I would have said, it’s completely incompetent. Now it’s kind of at the level of a graduate student. And so we’re making these fantastic advances very, very quickly. And I think that’s important for the world to understand how fast this is moving.\nSo just a summary of where we’ve been in software in the last 50 years started out. We communicated with computers and assembly language because that was efficient for them. Then we use languages like Python, because that was more efficient for our human programmers. And now\nwe can talk to them in English, and they can come up with answers. So that’s changing how we communicate with computers.\nWhen I started in the 19 eighties, AI was all about defining algorithms.\nThen around the 2 thousands, we had this era of big data where we said, if you want to make the machine better, it’s probably better to give it better data rather than try to come up with a better algorithm.\nAnd today, I think we’re in this field where it’s really important is the objectives to decide. We got plenty of good algorithms, plenty of good data. But we want to tell our programs. What is it that you should be doing. What is it that I want or I need, and how machines are really good at optimizing? But you got to tell them what to optimize.\nAnd so maybe we need more philosophers rather than programmers.\nAnd here’s a noted philosopher, Professor Mick Jagger, who said, you can’t always get what you want.\nBut you get what you need. But I think he got it backwards because we built this amazing Internet system to give you what you want.\nAnd every time you click on something that’s more feedback that you get more of that, and so do all your friends right. So I waste some time playing a game. And then I said, Man, I wish I had that time back. I wish I hadn’t wasted that time, but it’s too late for me, and it’s also too late for you, because if you’re connected to my network, then it’s going to be more recommendations for you to do more of that.\nSo we’re really good at satisfying what you want, but not good at satisfying what you need. So all these kind of global things that are really important. We don’t have a feedback mechanism to make them work on the Internet. And I think that’s something we need. We need to do a better job of saying, what is it that’s really important to us? And let’s have our systems work on that rather than work on the stuff. That’s not that important to us\nand getting this right of saying what’s important. That’s really hard now. 200 years ago, Judge Blackstone said. It’s better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer right? So you’re not going to get every court case right.\nAnd he’s saying, Here’s how you should make the trade off. I’m not sure if he was literal. It’s like 10 is better. But 11. No, that would be worse. I don’t think he’s trying to be quite that qualitative, but he’s saying we should kind of err in this direction, and we have to build our society based on those kinds of preferences. For which way do we want to go.\nand we’ve had hundreds of years of examples in our myths and stories about how this is hard saying what you want. So here’s King Midas. And he was asked what he want, and he said, I want everything I touched to turn to gold. But then he realized he made a mistake when he touched his daughter, and she turned to gold.\nAnd you know the genie, you always get 3 wishes, and sometimes you get it wrong. You wish you could get that back, and we have warnings to try to get that right. But there is technology where we could do a better job right? So King Midas should have said everything I touch. I want to turn to gold, but I also want an undo button.\nand if something is important I want a little pop up that says, Are you sure? Right? So we have technologies to do a better job on this, and we’ve got to take advantage of those. And if we can do that, then I think the promise will outweigh the peril.\nso let’s stop there and open it up for questions.\nand I’ll let Roxy back in through the door.\n27:24\nBrilliant. Thank you so much, Professor Norbig. At this time we can open up for questions. If you’d prefer to put your question into the chat and have it be read. We can do that, or you can feel free to come off mute and ask questions.\n27:41\nHey, Professor Norvig?\n27:43\nBye.\n27:44\nHey? I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about your work currently, or in the past, or any any of your work that you’ve done.\n27:53\nYeah. So I’ll talk about now, because that’s most fun. So I’m really interested in applying AI to education, right? So we’ve learned some things about education. And and one of the things we’ve learned is that the most effective way is kind of direct tutoring rather than lecturing. Right? So if I lecture to a big classroom of 100 students.\nI’m probably going too fast for 50 of them, and too slow for the other 50, and maybe a big part of what I’m talking about is not interesting to them, but they really want to hear about something else.\nIf you have a 1-on-one tutor, then you can get that. And the other thing we do wrong in our school system is, we say, you know, we’re going to teach this subject for a week, and then we’re going to have a test, and if you get a C on the test well, too bad! Next week we’re going to do something harder, and you’re probably going to get farther behind.\nWhat we really should have is mastery learning where we say you keep doing it until you get it, and then we move on to the next thing, and then you’ll be more successful.\nRight? So we know these things right? Educators have known these for decades that this is a better way to do it. But we’ve always said, Well, we can’t afford that right. We can only afford one teacher for every 30 students or whatever. So sorry.\nBut now maybe we have this technology to say, here’s something where we could get this individual attention, and we could have every learner go at their own speed until they really understand it. With the help of these AI models. And the question is.\nYeah, that seems right. And that seems like, you know, someday in the future that will work really well. But what can we do right now when these systems are flawed? How can we take a flawed system that’s going to make a lot of mistakes and still have it be useful to these students. So so that’s kind of what I’m focusing on right now.\n29:52\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\n29:56\nAnd next up I saw Teresa raise their hand.\n30:00\nI appreciate it.\nHi, Dr. Novik, I think, since large language models learn from human knowledge and reasoning, don’t these, like human limitations, also restrict the models like, can we ever build models to go beyond human thinking?\n30:15\nYeah, so that’s a great question. I think you’re mostly right. So\nI think they are. There is a real limitation based on human thinking. Now.\ncan it go beyond that? Well, yeah, in a couple of ways. So one is, it could be much better at memorizing everything that it reads. Second, it could work much faster than humans work.\nBut I think you are mostly right. And to me that’s really an encouraging thing rather than a discouraging. And here’s why, right? Because there’s some people right now that are worried about this super intelligence explosion of saying, you know, AI systems will get smarter, and then they’ll build another AI system that’s smarter still, and it will build a smarter system, and soon we’ll be left behind, and we’ll just be like\ninsects to these super intelligent AI systems. And I don’t think that’s true, for just the reason you say that I think they’re they’re partially limited by building on what we have.\nOn the other hand, I think they can go beyond it right. And we are seeing things like, you know. So I mentioned like the invention of new proteins. Right? So it used to be that as a biology student you could get a Phd. For describing how one protein folds up in shape as this long chain of proteins.\nAnd now an AI program just said, well, I figured out the answer for for every single protein that exists.\nAnd so it’s being kind of as creative as a Phd student. And it’s doing it much, much, much faster. And so, on the one hand, that’s just kind of following out kind of automatically what could be done. On the other hand, that makes a big difference. And I think we’re going to see, you know, inventions of new cures for disease, and so on, be greatly accelerated because of this kinds of capabilities.\nOkay, who’s who’s next? Brooklyn?\n32:24\nNext we have Suman.\n32:26\nHi, Professor Norvig. So earlier you mentioned that you’re not a fan of the term neural networks because of the differences between AI and the human brain. But my question is like at the end of the day. Doesn’t the brain ultimately function through like a series of chemical and electrical reactions, and even emotions, like as complex as they may seem.\nare like ultimately traced back to like biochemical processes, and like, when it ultimately comes back to like original thought on our idea is also shaped by like what we already know. So like, beyond the fact that humans are biologically alive, like, what do you think truly differentiates us from AI.\n33:01\nYeah, so that’s a great question. So I agree that you should think of humans and other animals as machines. They’re just biological machines rather than electronic circuit machines.\nBut I guess what I was trying to say is.\nyou know, when we when we build these AI models, they’re somewhat like a human brain in that. They’re saying it’s not like a computer where you’re just\nstoring one. You know, the variable variable X is a value 100. And it’s stored in one little box. Rather there. There are all these connections between different parts. And and to that extent it’s similar to to a human brain. But\nbeyond that, it’s like, we’re not trying to duplicate how the human brain works. We’re trying to build the most efficient computer. And you know, we haven’t had success by saying, I want to make an exact duplicate of the neurons in the human brain. So if you’re not trying to duplicate them, I think, taking their name is a little misleading. So that’s all I meant by that.\n34:18\nAnd next we’ll have Kelly.\n34:22\nHi, I’m from New Jersey, and I have a question, can AI like open any industries or jobs in the future? And if so, which ones.\n34:33\nYeah, so and that’s been a big controversy, too. Of you know what new jobs are coming and what old jobs are are going to be displaced. I think,\nthat’s that’s something we should definitely be worried about, because it’s always been the case that technology has changed the distribution of jobs. Right? So\nthere was a time 200 years ago when most people in America were farmers.\nAnd now a very small percentage are farmers, because the technology is so much more powerful. We don’t need that many. And that was overall really good food got cheaper and more plentiful and more varied and more healthy, and there wasn’t that bad effect because it happened slowly.\nRight? So you know, you might have someone who said, Well, my parents and my grandparents were farmers, and I’m a farmer, and I respect that tradition, but it looks like my kids. They’ve chosen to go to college and go off and live in the big city, and they’re not going to be farmers. So the change happens over generations. But if the change is happening now over years or months.\nyou know, the 1st time you say, well, I had a job, and then it got disrupted by AI, and I trained to have another job. And you say, Oh, that’s okay. But if it keeps happening every year.\ngoing to start to get annoyed by that and feeling bad, and there may be some pushback and revolutions against that. So we’re going to have to be careful to say, Yeah, there’s going to be a lot of wealth created. There’s going to be a lot of new possibilities, and and people will work doing that.\nBut we also have to worry about this disruption, and people don’t like change to go too fast, and the pace of change of AI just doesn’t seem to match the pace of change that people are comfortable with.\nSo we’re going to, I think, have to have some societal ways to make that transition easier. And people have talked about ideas\nlike universal basic income. Right? So if you’re out of a job, for whatever reason, maybe everybody gets a level where they’re comfortable until they can find something else to get them going again. So some kind of safety net because we’ve had job security as a safety net. That’s already been\npartially eroded due to technology. Right? So if you think back 2030 years ago it was more common for someone to come out of college\n38:01\nThank you, and next we’ll go to Luna.\n38:04\nHello! Hi, Professor Norvig! I’m Luna from Palo Alto, California, and I was wondering what books besides your own. Have you have influenced your thinking about AI, the most either like technically or philosophically.\n38:17\nYeah, I guess at least recently, I’m kind of negative on books, maybe even my own, because it just takes too long to publish a book, right? So you know, the the cycle for publishing a book is a year or multiple years.\n38:55\nGreat, and next we will go to Anandita.\n38:58\nYeah, Hi, Professor Norvik, I had 2 questions. So the 1st one is, how do you evaluate the importance of understanding classical AI, like planning and constraint, satisfaction in an era where many people just jump straight to deep learning.\n39:15\nYeah, that’s a great question. I think that part is still important. And\nand I think we’ll we’ll see that going forward, and we already are, seeing that to an extent. Now, right? So you look at you know what are the big advances of AI? Well, one of the milestones that happened a couple of years ago was Alphago beating the world. Go champion right? And so part of. And that was a big surprise, right? So it happened in chess back in the nineties. And people said, Well, it’s gonna happen eventually and go. But it’s going to be decades more. And then\nDeepmind was able to do it in a couple of years, and part of that was was due to deep learning. So that was really important, that they needed a good representation of what’s going on in the board. But then part of that was traditional. AI of saying, we’re going to do a search over the possible\nmoves that I can make, and then the moves you make, and then the moves I make. And they they use this approach called Monte Carlo rollout trees. And so that was important, right? And if if the team had only known deep learning\nthey could have built a good system that definitely could have clobbered me, but it wouldn’t have built it wouldn’t have beat the world champion. And so, knowing how to put these components together, knowing what the components are. I think that’s going to continue to be really important.\n40:48\nYeah, thank you. That was really insightful. So my second question.\n40:52\nSorry, Anandita. We we have a lot of questions.\nAnd so yeah.\npause at one. But we actually only have time. If it’s okay with you, Peter Norvik, for one more question to answer from those who have been also waiting patiently in the chat. So this 1st question is from Aran Sagi from Austin. What’s your favorite piece of work that you’ve done.\n41:19\nI guess it’s it’s being involved with Google and running the search team from for for about 5 years or so. Then I’ve had other jobs at Google but you know I was an academic for a while, and then I got into industry because I wanted to have a more effect on people.\nand I was at some small companies where we had a small number of customers, and that was great, and it was exciting to build stuff and say, You know, this is mine, it’s out there. But at Google it went from having a small number of customers to having billions of customers and saying, You know, I really feel like I have an impact on the world. It’s not just that I wrote a paper that a bunch of academics\ncan read, but that billions of people out there can use what I helped along with the rest of the team to build and have an impact and try to make their lives better. So that was most rewarding for me.\n42:22\nYeah, thank, you.\n42:23\nThank you so much, Peter.\n42:51\n43:14\nSounds great. Thank you again. Thank you so much for your time. Let’s go ahead and get a round of applause to Professor Peter Norvig for spending such a great deal of time with us this morning. That was fantastic, great! And we’re looking forward to seeing you again in the near future. Thank you so much.\nThank you. I’m going to hand it over to Fatima. Who’s going to give a couple of announcements. Here we are getting ready for a break before we get into some more content for our program today. So right before we go to break.\nAlright! Thank you.\n44:07\nThank you.\nand then I’ll drop something in the chat.\nHere we go.\nOkay, here we are.\nAlright. So you all should be able to see the student assignments. And I’m going to drop in the chat\nsome important links which include the Zoom link for your Group Project lecture, which is coming up.\nand then also\nthe Handbook. So I think we’ve mentioned this in the emails prior. But the Handbook is essentially going to be like\nwhat you’re referencing to go to the zoom links for each of the sessions. It’s a live document, and so there might be changes that are changes that are made. And so we ask you to frequent, and in return to it\nwe also wanted to drop in the chat, the Google classroom, if folks could please at this moment just like click into it, make sure you accepted the Google classroom. Invite. If you haven’t received it. Please speak up now. Also the group me once you click it, you should be able to access it, and if you can’t.\nthen please. You can. You can reach out to rhythm, or you can stay over a little bit. And if you’ve already been in contact with our team regarding any technical issues around that. We will be in communication with you shortly. But yeah.\nif there are any questions please feel free to stay over. But aside from that, that was my announcement. Just a lot of logistical stuff. You all thank you for for staying and great questions.\n46:21\nThank you so much, Fatima, for putting this together for us to view, and our group lectures will begin in about 10 min. So you have a 10 min break right now and then the links that were put into the chat. You will find your team, and then you’ll use that zoom link to meet with your your graduate mentors.\nso we’ll go ahead and leave this up here. And then once we get closer to\n11 o’clock, go ahead and click on your zoom link and join your team.\n47:02\nAwesome. Well, we hope that you all have a good break. And yeah, we’ll be here if you have any questions.\n47:26\nOh, yeah, I have a quick question. I emailed Miriam, a few days ago to like, ask if.\n"},"03_resources/Professor-Ge-Wang---Human-Centered-AI":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nProfessor Ge Wang, an associate professor in Stanford’s Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) and a senior fellow at Stanford Human-Centered AI (HAI), discusses the philosophical questions surrounding artificial intelligence. He challenges the conventional engineering mindset focused on efficiency and problem-solving, advocating for a \\“values-based design\\” where creation is driven by intrinsic worth rather than explicit need.\nHe uses personal projects like the Chuck programming language and the Ocarina app, as well as analogies from difficult video games (e.g., Elden Ring) and challenging hikes (John Muir Trail), to illustrate that effort, struggle, and even frustration can lead to deeper satisfaction and learning. He argues that AI should augment human capabilities rather than replace them, emphasizing the importance of asking \\“good questions\\” about AI’s role in our lives. Wang distinguishes between ‘intelligence’ (possessing tools to achieve desire) and ‘wisdom’ (critically evaluating desires and tools), asserting that wisdom is a crucial human pursuit. He warns against the “Confucian curse” of getting exactly what we wish for if our desires are misguided, stressing that removing the \\“labor of learning\\” from creative expression diminishes the creative act itself. Ultimately, he posits that AI’s purpose might not be to make things easier, but to make the hard things worthwhile, fostering a future where the human experience of learning and creation is valued.\nKey Points\n\nProfessor Ge Wang’s Background: Associate Professor at Stanford’s CCRMA (Music &amp; Acoustics), with a courtesy appointment in Computer Science, and a senior fellow at Stanford Human-Centered AI (HAI). All his degrees are in computer science.\nLiving in Interesting Times: The current era is characterized by rapid technological advancement, including AI, climate change, geopolitics, and social issues, leading to many questions but few clear answers.\nThe \\“What is the Point?\\” Question: A pivotal question from early in his career, leading him to build tools (like the Chuck programming language) for others to explore music creation, rather than a fully algorithmic music composition engine.\nValues-Based Design vs. Need-Based Design: His Ocarina app exemplifies a \\“values-based design\\“—created not to solve an existing problem or fulfill a market need, but because music-making is intrinsically good. This contrasts with conventional, problem-solving engineering.\nThe Value of Difficulty and Effort: Drawing parallels between challenging video games (e.g., Elden Ring) and arduous hiking (John Muir Trail), Wang argues that overcoming difficulties leads to profound satisfaction, learning, and a deeper appreciation of the experience, which a \\“helicopter ride\\” (easy solution) cannot provide.\nAI and Human Augmentation: AI should augment human capabilities, not replace them. Current generative AI often focuses on replacement, raising questions about authenticity, authorship, and the purpose of creation.\nIntelligence vs. Wisdom: Intelligence is having the tools to achieve what you desire; wisdom is the capacity to critically evaluate what you desire and the tools to achieve it. Wisdom is a continuous human pursuit that AI cannot replace.\nThe Confucian Curse: \\“May you find what you’re looking for.\\”: The greatest danger of AI might not be unintended consequences, but that it works exactly as intended by creators whose intentions were misguided or uncritical. We must be careful what we wish for.\nThe Labor of Learning: Removing the \\“friction\\” and \\“labor\\” from creative endeavors (like writing, drawing, or making music) risks removing the essence of the creative act itself and fostering a generation of consumers rather than creators.\nWhat Artists Want: Artists often desire for AI to handle mundane tasks (like laundry and dishes) so they can focus on their creative work, suggesting AI should optimize necessities, not core human pursuits.\nMaking Hard Things Worthwhile: The ultimate purpose of AI might be to make the hard things in life worthwhile, rather than simply making everything easier. Confusion and frustration are essential parts of learning.\n\\“What We Make Makes Us\\”: The technologies and systems we create fundamentally shape who we become as individuals and societies.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/ZJmrP8j8FUMoZt0PS5G7WPtiQrv2T2iHurfT1KPEZIUU5Jysx4T-ycriYNt9V2H8PTQAyj2FYq2h-uR5._kylDzadpHcUEya_%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2F_LICZEbY9TMlA0V1AEQ7oalKnTYK_L28Wo_leWcskIHqMsFbYzyfvr4FcWtWaKMU.CJsZdVkreEWczgYF\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 01:08:25\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:01:11\nPerfect.\nOkay, I’ll just go ahead and introduce Professor Ga.

So, without further ado, please welcome Professor Goang.\n00:02:27\nHi, everyone. Thank you so much for having me. And I am going to make sure that my settings are okay here.\nAnd before I I’m gonna have it just a swek of this coffee here. How y’all doing.\n00:02:48\nYes.\n00:02:49\nI feel free to use the chat function during this. And and I think it’s something I can see as well. So I usually try to keep an eye on it, so feel free to to do that. And\nBrooklyn, Miriam, quick question, what is the time we have here? So it’s like, until 2 o’clock. Our California time.\n00:03:13\nThat’s right.\n00:03:14\nAnd that includes questions as well. Right?\n00:03:17\nThat’s right. Yep.\n00:03:18\nOkay, well, how y’all doing? Feel free to\nto kind of put a word that describes how you’re feeling today into chat. If you like.\nI’m doing good. I’m doing good. And also, if you would\nput where you currently are located, took a general region, would do.\nWow all over the place.\nOkay, see India. Let’s see. Palo Alto.\nOkay?\nSo we’re going to talk about, what do we really want from artificial intelligence, our full design story.\nAnd\nyeah, I’m an associate professor here in music. And by courtesy, computer science. But all my degrees are actually in computer science. So I’m kind of a strange computer scientist\nand also the senior fellow, a senior fellow and a faculty associate director of Stanford, human-centered AI or Stanford High.\nI’ll just begin by saying we live in interesting times and feel free to put into chat how you feel about this particular statement. How many of you feel like you’re living in interesting times.\nAnd, by the way, I’m not saying that it’s necessarily automatically a good thing or a bad thing, or just just to say it’s interesting.\nHow do y’all respond to this statement? Does any of you feel like the times are interesting. Anyone feel like the times are maybe a little too interesting.\nMaybe in like a sentence, or less feel free to type how you feel as a person living on planet Earth\nin the year 2025, as we as we do right now.\nFor these times I have no answers. I have a lot of questions, but I feel like that’s also my job as a professor, as an educator is that I’m actually not here to supply answers, even though I like answers just as much as the next person.\nBut I’m here to try to help all of us, myself included. Figure out, what are the the good questions to ask?\nRight? And for these times, you know, whatever you’re thinking about that makes these times interesting.\nIt could be technology.\nIt could be AI. It could be\nthe climate and climate change. It could be geopolitics. It could be American politics.\nIt could be health care. It could be\nAnd for these times I truly have no answers. I’m just another person living in these times, but I am keenly interested in trying to figure out what are the questions to ask myself.\nand for and for my students. What are the questions to ask ourselves\nin these times? And in fact, I’m going to talk today about AI, and in a crisis of faith, because among all those questions we have right now, it seems like, this is a time when we have more technology than we’ve ever had in any other point in human history.\nBut I’m going to talk about kind of a personal crisis of faith, about AI that I’ve been having, and as someone that actually, whose degree all of his degrees are in computer science.\nI got my undergrad at Duke University in Cs, my Phd. In computer science. I was at Princeton.\nBut I’m 1 of these strange cats who\ndon’t really cleanly fit in any box.\nJust want to talk about that crisis of faith.\nIn fact, I think a good question to ask about a lot of this is, you know, what’s even the point. And the story goes, I was going to grad school in the year 2,001, probably before many of you were born, most of you.\nI was going to grad school. I was going to New Jersey, went to a house party. There was a band. The band was really good. I went up to ask him, hey? It’s like y’all are great. And the guitarist said, Hey, thanks! What’s your story? I said. I’m going up to grad school, and Princeton says, what are you going to study? I’m gonna study computer science. I want to go build in grad school. The world’s most advanced algorithmic music composition engine.\nAnd I said, that’s my goal. I want to go to grad school to to do that.\nAnd the guitarist looked me up and down, and he asked me very earnestly this question, what is the point?\nThat was a really good question, because I had no answers to it, but I felt it was a good, and it was a good question. I didn’t have an answer, and I said, You know I get back to you on that, and I’ll pocket\nthe question at Princeton in grad school.\nI didn’t end up building or even trying to build the world’s most advanced algorithmic music composition engine, which in today’s parlance would just be like called generative AI for music. I wanted to do this like 25 years ago, but I somehow like.\nmaybe because questions like this, I didn’t end up building it, because I feel like I couldn’t answer the question.\nBut maybe I can build a tool, I thought, where others, if they wanted to can explore this question for themselves.\nSo end up building, not the engine, the generative AI for music end up building a programming language, a tool they can learn with which to make sound music, musical instruments, musical interactions. And that was the chuck programming language.\nSo that’s part of my origin story. And in fact, my day to day. You know, I work at Stanford’s Computer Center for computer research and music and acoustics part of the music department. I have a courtesy appointment in computer science. And as a computer scientist, I’m really kind of a strange cat. And I deal with technology day in, day out. This is what I work with. I write code daily. I’ve been doing this for the last 20, maybe 30 years.\nI still write code. I love writing code. It’s 1 thing that I know I’m pretty good at, unlike a lot of other things that I wish I was better at. I feel like I’m pretty good at coding. I could still be better at coding, and I care to get better at it.\nBut I use it to make things musical instruments, musical games, toys.\nartificial intelligence systems with humans in the loop and a lot of tools for education and a lot of games.\nThe aforementioned programming language worked on is called chuck, named after the verb to throw something chuck, and it’s open source. It’s freely available. You can start making bleeps and bloops of this in a matter of minutes, maybe even less. You can go to Chuck Stanfordedu. If you’re interested in downloading, it’s freely available. It’s open source. Come, check us out. If you’re interested in exploring that I direct the Stanford Laptop Orchestra\nand actually, before I do this, I’m going to actually make the chat visible.\nSo I can.\nI can also keep an eye on this as I percent.\nWe go.\nI also direct the Stanford VR design lab. We’re asking such questions as, how do we make music and make music together? What kind of instruments make sense in a virtual reality medium? And also to the very philosophical question, what, in fact, is real. How do we think about reality? So if you’re going to talk about being real, I guess this is a way for us to try to figure out what that means.\nOne of our latest offerings to the Stanford VR. Orchestravork. This is a an ensemble of\nthis is. Basically, if you’re in the performance, you actually don’t hear anything unless you’re in VR, and on in in the headphones.\nThis is what it looks like kind of in the performance.\nCan y’all hear that?\nActually, there’s not much sound you hear just kind of room noise.\nbecause we’re actually outside of VR here. The audience is sitting here\nand we make strange computer music in here a lot of interaction. Then I do things like ocarina, which is\nis an something I designed back in the day. I’m gonna for this. I’m gonna stop sharing\nand actually play this for you.\nLet’s see, I need to figure out how to get original sound going here.\nSettings, we go to audio.\nOkay?\nI hope I have this on.\nI don’t see this in this new version of zoom how to turn that on.\nBut can you guys hear this?\nOkay, so\nthis is ocarina. It’s an app made on the iphone. I made this back in 2,008, and you play this. I’ve blown into the microphone at the bottom of the iphone. Here multi-touch is used to control pitch.\nVibrato is controlled by the tilt of the phone.\nand and so actually looks like\nZoom is asking me more questions. Here we go. You can play a little ditties with this.\ntoo. Choo, choo, choo, choo.\nfor example, right? So I’m actually blown to the phone sound is entirely generated on the device. It’s actually there’s a chuck program, the programming which I talked about. That’s running inside this app that’s generating the sound in response to microphone input that’s audio multi-touch input and accelerometer input for the tilt.\nSo yeah, this is made in 2,008. And somehow, oh, my God, it’s been 17 years, and I’m still demoing this, and y’all are still like this is so cool. It’s pretty old technology, especially by mobile phone standards. This might be older than some of you, I think. So I’ll let you do with that information what you would like, and let’s go back to the presentation.\nAnd also I’m going to go ahead and bring up chat again, so I can see it.\nYou can actually find this on the app store. It’s only on the iphone. It’s not on Android.\nIt’s only on the iphone. You can find other smule apps\non on Android if you like, including magic piano, which I also designed. That was in 2,012.\nAny case. So this is ocarina in gameplay mode.\nIn this case you can see this is kind of the game mode of ocarina in which there are these circles falling down the side of the middle of the screen. That’s actually prompting you how to play the next note. This is kind of like tar, hero, or rock band, but for ocarina. But the big difference is that the music? None of the sound you’re hearing is pre-recorded. It’s all generated live, which means you can affect the sound.\nand learn to kind of express the sound in your own way. So that kind of open expression is very important to the design of this app as much as I love guitar, hero and rock band, and\nas games and experiences.\nAnd but but there’s more there is another\nside in the same app where you can listen to other people around the world, blow into their phones and make music.\nWho is that playing? Oh, Shenandoah from the East Coast, United States. Well, you don’t know. In fact, that’s part of the experience. Or who is that playing legend of Zelda theme\nIndonesia again, we don’t know. And in fact, anonymity was designed into this part of the app, because\nI kind of figured that. Well, actually, what’s knowing doesn’t actually make the experience necessarily better, but not knowing well, it makes you wonder and it. And so this part of the app becomes about just listening in, and then kind of\nI think not knowing actually might be an asset here.\nAnd here’s the big question, though. Oh, by the way, ocarina of time, yes, this.\nThis is actually part of the market research. I did when when I was starting to design this app in 2,008, I was like, does anyone even know what an ocarina is?\nSo I decided to just do some market research. And by market research, I meant, I went to Youtube and I typed in Ocarina. And lo and behold, here was Doc jazz 4. That’s the Channel name.\nHe’s teaching people how to play like a clay ocarina, and a lot of the songs he had were from, of course, legend of Zelda, the ocarina of time, and the more people I talk to, the more I realize people\nnew ocarina through. Of course, the game Zelda ocarina of time, which to this day remains a classic\nand one of the greatest games of all time. So ocarina of time. So yeah, Zelda, in some ways is in the DNA of this. And of course all this brings us to this question, why was this designed?\nI’m going to give you all just a moment. If you want to type in, there are no wrong answers. This is really exploration. Why do you think this was designed? For what reason\nfor fun? It’s cool, why not, hey? I think y’all y’all are. I like these answers. There are no wrong exploration. Yeah, this was also, of course, a commercial product. It was meant to make money. So that was another reason, even though, to be honest.\nI that wasn’t the primary reason for me.\nand maybe it’s closer to a lot of what some what many of you are saying, right for fun, for expressing yourself.\nIt’s cheaper than like a real instrument. Well, considering that the apple is 99 cents, it is pretty cheap, though you do need like a\niphone to go with it, so I don’t know how much the cost washes out. And is it convenience? There are all these questions. I don’t know if there’s any wrong answers here.\nI think it was a number of reasons, but probably the most honest reason I can give you is that\nactually there was no great reason, but maybe the greatest reason of all. Nobody asked for this, and this solves no problems that exist. And I say this as an engineer.\nwho, I think, have been building things for the last 2 decades\nalong this particular route, building things that nobody quite asked for, that solves no problems that exist. But we put in as much of engineering\ncare, finesse, skill, and imagination into these things that we can muster.\nAnd so I guess\nthis is kind of what I want to put out there as we talk, begin to talk about kind of the rest of this talk, which is\naround technology in this particular AI\nand around the importance of actually building things in this way. Because this, you know, it’s not like, we went out and asked people, hey, people, we’re building a new app. What do you need? What are you missing? What problems do we need to solve? And people are like, well, we need to solve the problem that we can’t blow into our phones like a flute. No, no one said, nobody said that right, nobody said that, and nobody really nobody asked for this.\nAnd this really doesn’t solve any existing problem.\nAnd yet, you know. So so I guess this is what some would call not a need-based design, but rather a values-based design\nright in that. By value space we mean that this was designed, not because there’s some clear and present practical need because of a belief in something.\na value. For example.\nif if we think that music making does a person good, it’s just an intrinsically good thing to do to make music, we might call that a value, and if we have, if we hold that value as something that is a value to us.\nthen that would be enough in values-based design to start designing and to start building and to devote effort, time and resources into building.\nThis, to be sure, is a very\nnon-conventional way to think about engineering.\nwhich all of you in some way form are doing as you’re working with AI right?\nbut this, perhaps, as we enter into the age of AI, maybe the maybe I would think one of the more most important things we can\nthink about and attend to as engineers.\nin that there are things that the reasons for building things that go beyond\nwhat someone needs, or beyond making something more efficient or more convenient or more optimized.\nRight? So in this talk which we’re asking, what do we really want from AI? This has no AI in it. But I am trying to set up this framework for asking this question of why do we? What kind of things do we want to make with AI? And how do we think about the things we make with AI. And what does it mean\nto make AI for all? Truly\nthe\nthere’s a sentiment that technology should create calm. This is a kind of a interesting sentiment in that it’s not saying technology is going to\ncreate wealth or technology is going to solve problems. But maybe, also, technology could bring a kind of intercom\nin our lives.\nYou know, this is a sentiment from\nMark Weiser, who was the chief technology officer of Xerox Parc, the iconic and famed research lab in Palo Alto that they’re responsible for refining a lot of the desktop used computer user interface paradigms that we still use to this day among a number of other innovations.\nAnd so you know, that’s that’s the tech side of me. By the way, there’s a lot of other sides to me. I play a lot of games, feel free to put into chat. If you also play some of these games I’m gonna name. I’ve been playing Starcraft one since 1999. And then I started playing starcraft to any Starcraft people out there feel free to pipe up.\nYeah, good for you.\nAaron Rock, on anyone playing heroes. The storm! Oh, my God! Your father’s play, starcraft! I feel I feel\nwise and and old, rock on, and good for your good, for your dad and your brother.\nAnyone playing assassin’s creed? I played assassin’s creed, origins played assassin’s creed, Odyssey, and played assassin’s creed\nValhalla. I did not like Valhalla for the record. I loved origins, and\nand which is set in ancient Egypt, and then Odyssey, which is set in ancient Greece any Disco Elysium players here? This is truly a wonderful game, purely narrative, driven\ndivinity. Original sin. 2. This is made by the company. If you play Baldur’s gate. 3. Larian made both games.\nAnd then I started getting into like really difficult video games like armor. Core 6,\nany A/C 6 fans here, Sekiro. This is a very difficult game.\nvery difficult armored corps. Yeah, I got all the achievements. It was very difficult, but I feel so proud of this.\nIn fact I am. I’ve played this game like I’ve played new game. Their new game. 7. No problem. Love this game still love one of my favorite games of all time. Really hard. Got to be some elven ring players in the room.\nElden Ring. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nHow do y’all feel for those elden ring player. How do you? How do you feel about playing this game?\nWould you say this is an easy game, Nope.\nwhy do you still play it?\nI’ve logged. Personally, I’ve got all the achievements on steam alone. I’ve logged more than 700 h, and I have a separate account on Ps. 5. On this this feeling of satisfaction, of getting new stuff. Satisfaction. Wow! Satisfaction! You know what? Let me interpret that a bit\nfor those of you who don’t play Elden ring. This is a game in an action. Rpg, and you’re running around usually with a big sword or some other kind of like two-handed wielding implement. And you’re trying to go through this pretty, dismal world. But then there are all these bosses, and the bosses really are very, very difficult. The whole game is difficult.\nand it’s not uncommon to die like 60 times to a boss. Am I right? You know, the 1st time I ran into Margit, which is the 1st difficult, boss man, I must have died like 50 times.\nbut when I beat Margaret for the 1st time, that’s the feeling.\nIt’s a feeling of getting better. You know the feeling is not. I think it would be. It would be incorrect, insufficient to say there was like a dopamine hit of beating. It’s not the dopamine hit here, I think, beating a boss that you feel like was previously insurmountable in a game like Elden Ring or Sekiro, or dark souls.\nright, or lies of P, or 1st Berserker Kazan. And these really punishingly difficult video game\nis is for me. It feels like getting an A on an exam that I studied for\nand is finally able to execute. Yeah, Melaketh hard, boss.\nMelania, I’ve been here. I don’t know more times than I can count, but it’s she’s still difficult for me. Right?\nBut I think what you end up realizing, and this is actually believe it or not relevant to this talk on AI\nis that in playing these difficult video games, and if you don’t play these games I’m giving you, I think I’m trying to give you an idea of what what it feels like to die so many times.\nBut you do feel the sense of satisfaction. You also feel the sense like getting an A on a test that you learned something.\nAnd my question to those of you who play these difficult video games is, do you wish the game to be fundamentally easier?\nIf so, why? And if so, if not, why not?\nWhat are your thoughts on that? And there are no wrong answers here. Just curious.\nAll right. I’m going to give you all time to think about this.\nYeah, you know, easy mode and not be the worst thing. These games often don’t come with an easy mode.\nSome say not really. It’s part of the experience to grow after boss or level. No way. The challenge is the whole point of the game. No, because I have Easter games for that. And that one game being hard is fun.\nYeah, you know, some would say that these really challenging boss fights.\nThey’re not the obstacle on the path to playing the game.\nThey are the path.\nKeep that in mind. The challenges in this game are not obstacles to get to the other side of they are. Why, you play the game\nright and so I’ll leave it at that and let you make of that what you will.\nyeah, I’ve been playing Elden ring a lot. Platinum, Liza PI haven’t started the Dlc. Yet. I’m about to play first.st Berserker, Kazan. I just went back, and I’m like a new game plus 4 of bloodborne 10 year old game, which is still really good. So, anyway.\nthat’s the other side of me. It’s gaming, and I’m just game a lot. And then there’s another side of me that’s hiking\nafter being stuck indoors during the pandemic, my my wife said to me, Hey, we gotta get out of here, and you know what I said to her, I said.\nbut wait, do we have to? You know we’re indoors. We got the couch. We got the fridge. I got my video games. Why do we gotta go I don’t know, suffer outdoors, and deal with\nmosquitoes and tents and rocks.\nbut my wife is pretty serious. Madeline was like, no, we got to get out of here, and I said I saw that she was serious, and then I wasn’t getting out of this. I said, You know what. Let’s let’s do it. But I was a reluctant hiker at first, st\nbut we started working our way up to longer and longer hikes. The longest one we did was on the John Muir Trail here in California that is, entirely in the High Sierra, and rarely dips below 8,000 feet of elevation. That particular backpacking trip took us 22 days.\nwhere on the trail mosquitoes were a common occurrence, and where showers were not.\nAnd, in fact, if you’re interested, you can watch a short film on\non Youtube called on the Devil’s Road. That was our 2 h venture. Do you want to watch 2 noobs\ntry to make their way through the wilderness. This is this is 2 h of your life. You could, you could. You can channel into that. This is a 50 second trailer for it now for a taste of things to come.\nFuck, giant fucking piles of rocks.\nYeah, literally. Peek, I suppose. Yeah, as you can tell, it’s a very honest video, which I did not refrain from expressing my emotions\nat different times towards the rock. If you’re not going up a mountain, you’re going down a mountain. One day on this hike.\nwe maybe in the middle of it. Day 13. We had to go up John Muir Pass, which is one of the like a dozen mountain passes on the trail. On that day we experienced 3,000 feet of elevation, climbing up 3,000 feet over rocks. My feet hurt, had blisters.\nand then\nwe went through a lake which was the most amount of mosquito I’ve ever met in any given point. We had to run through like clouds of mosquitoes.\nand then it started raining and hailing, which is kind of a danger up that high because we’re above the tree lines, and lightning is like a real danger.\nSo we were cold. We were wet somehow the bugs were still there, and I was honestly miserable. I’m like, what am I even. Why are we doing this to ourselves? But then 5, 30 rolls around, we get to Evolution Lake. The thunderstorm stops, the mosquitoes dissipate.\nand we see this double rainbow which you saw at the end of the video.\nAnd I started thinking to myself, Man, what a contrast to what it took to get here. And then I asked myself, you know what if there’s like a helicopter\nthat just took me to this point.\nthis beautiful Evolution lake with a double rainbow. But you know what I thought then I said, no, I don’t. I would not take the helicopter ride. I suffered to get here.\nand in suffering I earned this. This place feels different because I am not a tourist.\nI’m now a hiker who made it up here, and in some ways I don’t know what it is that I learned, but I felt like I learned a little bit about myself that day\nand every day on the Jmt. Even though I would say 98% of doing the Jmt. The John Muir Trail was kind of like\nsuffering that we kind of signed up, for\nthere were 2% of it. That was just so sublime that I find my mind going back there all the time.\nSo.\nby the way, you might, starting to see a theme emerging. This is kind of not that different from\nbesting Elden ring, except just a different form. This this peak was a boss. It was.\nIt was not pleasurable to get up there. But when you finally get up there.\nman, that feeling is so good.\nAny case, this is all to say. By the way.\nnot long ago the Internet was an escape from the real world where today the real world is an escape from the Internet. There’s something to that, I suppose, then, I make art using the tools we make in things like the Laptop Orchestra. And for me, that’s life\nwhich I think it’s really what design is actually all about.\nIt’s life. It’s not problem solving.\nIt’s life. It’s designing for figuring. It’s casting a vote to how you want to live your life.\nAnd on this I wrote the book, Artful Design technology in search of the sublime. If you go to Http artful dot design.\nThat’s the website for the book. You can learn more from the book and read a lot of excerpts from the book, if you like, and Brooklyn, if you would. If you can put the URL into chat, artful dot design\nhold on one. And\nSo this book actually ends up being a\na 488. Page. Comic book\nagain. Nobody asked for this and thank you, Miriam.\nNobody asked for this to be a comic book, but you know I grew up with comic books, and so I thought this would be well. They say the medium, the medium is the message in the sense that\nthe medium certainly has the power to to modulate the message.\nHow you say something is not separate from what you want to say. It’s part of what you want to say right? So that’s 1 interpretation.\nBut this is a book that ultimately asks these questions, what is the nature of design? Who designs? The answer is, we all do\nby virtue of being human, you design the moment you try to shape your surroundings with an outcome in mind. That’s design.\nIf that’s designed, what does it mean to design well.\nwhich I think is different from the question, how do we not mess up and design to design well? Is not the same thing as not designing poorly.\nAll right, let me repeat that designing good is different than not designing badly.\nBoth are important actually to not fail in design. To not do something awful with design is good.\nit’s a necessity, but it may not be sufficient.\nRight to say something is good actually requires a different kind of lens.\nAnd thirdly, in this age of so much technology and so much human\ndiscord and restlessness, what does it mean to design? Ethically? Those are the questions of this book.\nAnd so that brings me now to music and AI, which is a course I’ve been teaching here at Stanford\nonly for the last 3 years, but it’s kind of been 3 years 3 pretty epic and crazy, tumultuous years for artificial intelligence. But I teach this not as a course you might\nexpect. But what I would call a critical making course, which means we’re going to make a lot of stuff. That’s the making. We’re also gonna try to think as broadly as possible about the implications of what we make. That’s a critical part.\nLecture, one asks, is title. Is this even a good idea\nthat is applying AI to music. And let’s leave room for the possibility that not all music needs AI, or that\nmaybe it’s not a good idea, or that maybe it is a good idea, or maybe some of it’s a good idea, and some of it’s not. But let’s, this is what I mean by critical right. Let’s actually not take anything for granted. Let’s question\nthis is also a question about me teaching this class to be honest, and I told my students that I’m like, I’m not sure if I should even be teaching. This is even a good idea that I teach this class.\nAs we went on we realized we came from many different backgrounds, but we were unified by one thing that we all had, which was a thing that we termed AI fomo. You can probably guess what that is.\nMaybe we’re here because we don’t want to miss out. We had to fear missing out on AI\njust like I had a fear of missing out of like teaching this class. I’m like, I’m a computer music. I’m a computer science guy in a computer music department. Shouldn’t I be obligated to teach this course? You know I don’t want to miss out on. I don’t want to miss out on the bandwagon in a way. So that’s a very human, understandable reason for doing this. And if you have AI Fomo actually feel free show of hands honestly, how many people feel like you got AI Fomo.\nOh, I see a lot of people raising your hands. Yeah, to be honest, if you’re in a program called AI for all, if you’re in any program learning about AI, if you’re feeling like, I got to learn AI, you might have AI Fomo, and it’s totally okay. I have AI fomo, I still have AI fomo.\nAnd, by the way, AI fomo seems the highest in places where AI is actually done. For example.\nin universities in Silicon Valley.\nyou know. Thanks, by the way, for everyone who’s raising their hand. I think we probably all have some form of AI phone. The more you learn about AI, the more the world is telling you, hey? Shouldn’t you figure out how to do something with AI because you don’t want to be missing out on this, do you? Right? There’s that voice in our head that’s always asking us to be like, shouldn’t I be using AI for this?\nAnyway, we realized we had afomo. But I said, You know, whatever we have, and it’s okay to have afomo. Totally. Okay.\nI do say that what this class is about is not about answers.\nIt’s not about state-of-the-art technology, even though we’ll use some AI in our work. It’s about questions formulating the right and the best kinds of questions we have for ourselves about what it means to live for AI, to live among us and for us to live with our technology?\nBecause at the end of the day, isn’t that\nthe real question here? How do you, as a person want to live with AI in your life. And what’s a what’s the good version of that?\nAnd also\nthe way that AI is going right now, if that differs from your notion of what’s good. What’s actually at stake? What are we at risk of losing those, I think, are the questions.\nThe purpose of art, James Baldwin once wrote, is to lay bare the questions that have been hidden by the answers.\nThis was a lovely sentiment about art.\nright? That it’s a kind of lens\nto examine ourselves. The answers are, might already be here. It’s in front of us. But what do they mean? And I think, even though James Baldwin was not writing about artificial intelligence. He was actually writing about\nactually, politics. In this case, global politics in the sixties.\nI think this is actually applicable to artificial intelligence in that we do have the answers AI can already generate impressively competent text video audio images can do your taxes. I would definitely check over the results of your taxes if you have AI. Do it before I submit it, but it can purport to do a lot of these things to a pretty impressive amount, astoundingly\nimpressive amount of competence.\nAnd yet what does it mean? That’s the question. The answers are kind of here.\nbut it’s the questions that are lagging behind.\nSo that brings me to this question, what do we really want from AI? Do we want a big red button that just makes everything easier, simpler, more convenient, faster, more optimized. Do we really want to? 5 x ourselves?\nOr is there something more to it that we want? If you look at music.\nit’s not really about efficiency, is it? People spend years and years\nto learn an instrument? And, by the way, feel free to raise your hand or type into chat, basically like, if you play a musical instrument or engage in some kind of hobby that you like.\nwhat is that hobby? If you would feel free to put that into chat.\nI see singing piano, flute, alto, sax guitar, piano, violin, film, keyboard, singing guitar, ukulele, French horn, puppet, trumpet trading piano, origami\nswimming beats and golf.\nSo I guess.\nAnd do you like it, I guess, is the next question. And\nand I guess to someone who likes what you’ve been doing, and have been doing this for some time.\nmaybe a few years or longer.\nRight?\nHow would you feel if AI just did it for you? Would you be okay with that. And this is a genuine question. Right? This is again, no wrong answers no right, because there are no right answers here. It’s really just how you feel.\nSome people say definitely, not, no, depends. No, yeah. You know, it’s it’s it’s it.\nAnd why not? For those of you who are saying No, and, by the way, depends is also a good answer as well as no, and maybe in some cases yes, it’s all like, I said. There’s no wrong answer.\nSome things aren’t meant for AI that’s interesting. Feel free to expand on this, if you like. Right? There’s.\nyou know this is, I think this is, goes back to the question, what do we really want from AI? Because I think the world is telling you, hey? AI is about reducing the cost of labor\nas about making things more efficient as about optimizing.\nAnd if you were to optimize all of these things.\nisn’t that just automatically better? And I guess I’m here saying.\nwhat if it’s what if those aren’t the only things to work for?\nSo\n10 or 3 of Stanford’s human centered AI. Applications should augment human capabilities, not replace them right, even though I think so much of AI that’s out there in the world is doing exactly this replacing.\nThink of any of the Gen. AI kind of tools for images or music or video.\nYeah, I mean, this is good good questions. I mean, Samuel writes, I mean, regardless people may use ad for music, and maybe that’s fine, right? But each person maybe get to get to choose. And then\nbut then questions abound. Is that like, does it matter\ntree to know who wrote the music?\nOr is this simply, are you simply content to have the end product? How much does the process matter right? And, by the way, to think through these questions again, I have no answers. I do think that this idea of thinking about your favorite hobby might be a good lens to train to this question.\nRight? Doesn’t doesn’t matter. And again it the answer\noften, maybe somewhere between I don’t know, and it depends\nto no, to yes, and it but it all kind of depends on how you’re thinking about this. But this the point is to actually think about these things, to actually have that question\nand to have that bounce around in your head right? And I think that’s probably the maybe by far the most important skill to have in this age of AI far more than any technical skills around doing AI, which, by the way.\nwill be obsolete in the next year, 5 years, month, or even next\nnext day, depending on how things are going.\nBut the good questions about what these things mean in our lives and how you want to move through the world with this technology embedded in our lives. I think that question is not going away.\nThe skills you have are important.\nBut they should go alongside kind of these sets of questions that we’re asking. So let’s look at some student work that people have done in my course.\nThis 1st one is, ask them to make a poetry tool which you can kind of perform with. It’s not a generating tool per se. It’s not like, Hey, generate a poem of this of this kind. And here’s a poem. No, this is a poem you kind of play as an instrument, a poem generator along the way this is made using vectorized words.\na kind of ancient uncle or aunt, if you will, of modern Llms. This is like vectorized words, unsupervised learning. It’s basically like taking a corpus of text, like all the news articles from New York Times in the last 50 years, putting them into and constructing a model based on some kind of semantic similarity. And what you end up with is a high dimensional space, maybe\ncommon to have 50 to like 500 different dimensions of\nbasically like these dimensions of by which\nsimilarity could be measured. For example, the term cat\nwould likely be similar by some metric to the term kitten\ncompared to say, cat and airplane. Right? That’s the idea of vectorized words is that you actually have a mathematical location, a high dimensional space for each unique term.\nAnd so students are to use this to make a kind of poetry tool. This is one called stormfury.\nstorm, it time, division, storm. Fumi.\nmoving up moving left. This isn’t a dimensional reduced version of it. What is Wantsham? What is Goten? What is Bioshield? I have no idea there’s a cool beat. Why not when things really get going, we’re teleporting. Look to the left. Who is Susan reamer@baldsend.com. Someone’s email made it into this database to this model.\nThis is all to say, there’s a lot more to AI than prompt, based, and generative. And we can think of AI either as an oracle versus tools. Second assignment is to use a interactive AI framework called Wecnator to create\n3 interactive, a utilities toys in everyday life. These don’t have to be useful. In fact, whimsical, is good, absurd, is good, playful is wonderful.\nAnd this is the work of Dr. Rebecca Feebrink, an expert in the introduction of AI Hci, human computer interaction and music and music.\nYou can use Wackinator to create tools like\nlittle toys like this. This is a wavebot.\nIt waves when it waves back when you wave at it. That’s all it does. By the way.\nthis is trained in less than a minute.\ntook far longer to actually conceptualize and build the robot with its moving parts and servos, connect up the software.\nAnd so this is what my students have been doing. This one is called auto riz.\nI’ll just let you do with this what you will.\nAnd I told people you need to deploy this.\nand you got to deploy it. So here’s here’s being deployed\ndifferent users.\nRight?\nThat’s all it does. Of course, this is\nAutoris. Of course, it’s meant to be a thing that detects riz. And\nbasically, if you have a seductive look, it plays this.\nthis, this Gloria’s music. And so it’s a classifier. It’s a classifier. It’s a riz classifier. And of course, this is kind of a commentary, perhaps also on technology itself. This is this is this is a playful way to look at it. And of course this is all this does, it’s so.\nWell, let’s listen to the author, Matt, who made all riz. I really enjoyed this assignment. I think it’s easy to adopt this toxic capitalistic mindset that everything you do or make has to be productive or for something. But when we follow that dogma, we forget to make beautiful things just because they’re beautiful, do funny things just because they’re funny or make stupid projects just because they’re stupid. There’s so much beauty in doing things just because it’s nice to take a pause on life and to make something just for the sake of making it and for a grade. But that’s more of an afterthought.\nHmm! What do y’all think about that?\nAny case, here’s something else made also with Wekinator. This is hand to voice.\nNow, this is stuff that AI is really good at. By the way, imagine trying to program this without AI,\nright? It would be actually like, this is what data is actually very good at is, you can just train it to recognize not only the hand, but then different hand gestures. And using Wackinator, you can quickly, by example, map this and create a compact even in real time model that can respond right? And think about how far this is from this generation of everything has to be a text prompt.\nBut this is still using AI right\nin the interest of time. I’m going to go ahead and just summarize. What did we learn from this class. We did not get over AI Fomo. We still have it, but this is kind of a therapy and a coping mechanism for AI Fomo. We talked about AI and accountability\nwhich AI doesn’t really have today.\nbecause we don’t know what it means for AI, for Chatgpt, for any of these generator image to have this thing we call authorship, which goes with this word accountability. If you put your name on something that you’re putting out there.\nthat means there would, for better, for worse. You are responsible for some part of it. You’re accountable for it. There’s a question of authenticity.\naccuracy which, by the way these 2 things are not this exactly the same? For one, you would have very different measures and different ways to gauge whether something is authentic versus whether it’s accurate.\nOne seems to be something that’s more quantifiable, like accuracy where there’s a base standard, whereas authenticity, I think, is a trickier thing to to get at. And then this huge a word, this Scarlet Letter word in this case\nis aesthetics. Aesthetics isn’t just like how something looks or feels.\nBut actually how something really feels.\nwhether a thing is something that abides by who you are or something that makes you more you, whether it’s something that you would be like. I think that’s part of the world I want to be a part of, or that says something about the people I want to be. Part of this is aesthetics on a grand scale of what it means to feel as a person.\nyou know, that’s something that’s also very tricky with AI today we talked about AI and transparency, how this is so important. But it’s also very hard in AI. We talked about AI in education.\nAnd what we talked about is that maybe AI in education isn’t about intelligence, even though that’s in the word AI\nintelligence we might define as possessing the tools to achieve which desire basically says, Can you get\nwhat you want if you have means to get what you want? Hey? You know what you’re you’re smart, you’re intelligent.\nbut wisdom is having the capacity to actually critically evaluate what you want in the 1st place, and also to critically evaluate the tools or the means you have to achieve what you want? Are those things actually good? And for whom are they good?\nThat’s the difference between intelligence and wisdom. And this is to say intelligence alone.\nIt’s generally not enough. It’s never enough.\nAnd I’m not suggesting that we need to have artificial wisdom\nquite the opposite, I’m thinking. Well, maybe artificial intelligence would help us with the intelligence. But maybe wisdom is something we’ve got to learn to always have for ourselves.\nbecause you still got to have that end wisdom of figuring out what is good for yourself\nand for your communities?\nRight to even ask the question, how much technology do we want to use. And do I want to\nhave the judgment for my own, rather than farm out the judgment to another entity?\nAnd I think AI is over-indexed on the former, while perhaps forgetting a lot about the latter.\nRight? So I want, if there’s 1 slide to take away from this talk, it might be this one, the difference between intelligence and wisdom, the second one being the much harder but much more intrinsic thing. If you learn it’s, you know, by the way.\nwisdom is not something you acquire, and you’re done. It’s a thing that for as long as you live.\nif you choose, you can choose to always try to be a wiser version of yourself.\nIt’s kind of a nice human pursuit.\nanyway. I have no answers, quick questions. We live in interesting times. My times got really interesting when I became a parent a year and a half ago.\nShe’s already learning about AI in some ways.\nand I look at her, and I think about the future.\nand all I can think about is, what kind of future is she going to grow up in? You know it’s not just AI. It’s not just education, it’s all of it. You know. The world is so impermanent\nand so in so much uncertainty. America.\nwe’re living in hugely troubling, trying and uncertain times\nthat I wonder if she’s gonna grow up. She’s most likely going to grow up with less rights\nthan her mother, you know, and these thoughts.\nThey confound me, they worry me.\nBut whatever the future is for her\nat the end of the day, I just feel like it’s a future I can barely imagine.\nand as someone who thinks about the future a lot whose work some people ask me all the time, Go, what’s the future of art and music with AI, and I always say I don’t know, and it depends.\nAnd also, by the way, there’s not a single future. Music and art is going in a million directions at any given time. And I think that’s a good thing.\nSo this has been my crisis of faith as a person who’s been doing AI for many years, but also this person who critically\nquestions and examines himself\nwhen it comes to engineering technology, artificial intelligence. And I think that’s not a bad thing, though, because I’d rather be in crisis than to be complacent.\nIt’s okay to have that spark of rebellion.\nBecause what if the whole point of music of art is that we make it.\nand the fear is that we might go from having good things to more and more just things that are good enough because good enough might be good enough to monetize. Think of all the Gen. AI. Music and\nart and video services that’s out there, you know, they’re they purport to\ndemocratize music or art making. But I think if a critical person might say, Wait a minute. But aren’t you just creating like a whole new generation of consumers.\nAre you really here to help me make art? And what the hell does democratizing music even mean\nwhich I? It’s a term I’ve used in the past.\nbut I’ve come to realize what a bullshit term it actually is, because it’s so easy when you say to democratize art, making or music making to confuse, confound\naccess to these things versus the vital labor of learning. To do these things.\nAccess in general is good, but you can’t take away the labor.\nthe confusion, and the frustration of learning how to make art\nwithout also throwing away the part where you’re learning to make art.\nand where the you know, to take away the labor in creating something would actually be taking away, creating.\nin creating something. They’re taking away the creative in creative expression.\nAt least, these are thoughts that I would put forth the questions I put forth.\nI would ask you to make these what you will. But I want to put these questions out there, and the fear is that we would end up with things that are serviceable often, but sublime never\nthat we’d enter into a new age of generic.\nWhat artists want for the interest of time. I’m just gonna go with this one. This you probably heard this one. It’s almost been kind of a meme now, one. I had to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing not, for I had to do my art and writing, so I can do my laundry and dishes.\nThis is actually surprisingly uniform sentiment from artists.\nIt’s like, Why is AI doing all the things that we humans love laboring to do.\nIsn’t that putting, pointing our attention in the wrong places?\nor have AI help us make some real inroads on like climate science.\nor to do my dishes and laundry, I’d be okay with that, unless, of course, someone really enjoys doing dishes and laundry\nintrinsically.\nWouldn’t that be nice?\nGood question, Holly\nJohn Cage, in the sixties. What we need is a computer that isn’t labor saving, but which increases the work for us to do quite an interesting contrarian comment.\nwhich is, what if AI is not about making things easier all the time, but making the hard things worth doing?\nWhat if that was the case.\nAnd also what if being confused and frustrated is an essential part of learning anything?\nIf you’re never confused, never frustrated. If you remove the friction from our daily lives. What are we actually learning? What are we actually experiencing\nlike a hard video game? This all comes back. What if all things worthwhile are mountains to climb.\nThe reverse is not necessarily true. Not all mountains to climb are worthwhile.\nis not a mountain to climb that is worthwhile.\nBut all things worthwhile might just be mountains to climb.\nWhen we talk about hard video games to maybe actual mountains.\nThere’s something in that.\nif nothing else. We learn more about ourselves. But I think there is something even more than that.\nsomething akin to what we might call the human experience.\nYeah. So maybe it’s not about making things easier with AI, but making the hard things worthwhile, doing no answers, only questions. I’m going to go ahead and end this on one of my final notes. Here\nI started this talk by saying, we live in interesting times.\nThis is often labor\nregarded as what we call the confusion. Curse. Confusion is being by the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius.\nBut I don’t think Confucius actually ever said this.\nYou know, this is something we kind of attribute to Confucius, for whatever reason, at least in the West.\nBut it’s it’s it’s a curse.\nyou know. It’s why I asked you how many feel like the time’s a little too interesting. But this is only part one of the 3 part. Curse the second part of the curse, says, may you attract the attention of powerful people, I’ll let you think about why, that may be a curse. I grew up in China.\nand I think that basically translates to maybe attract the attention of the government.\nNo, thank you. But the 3rd part is what I want to call your attention to. The 3rd part of the Confucian curse.\nsimply says, May you find what you’re looking for.\nand I think this for Aei\nis the following, it’s saying, be careful what you wish for.\nThe danger with AI is not only what. If AI went off the rails and did things that we had never\naccounted for, that we never intended unintended consequences.\nYeah, that’s a problem, to be sure, but I think the even larger, more insidious\nproblem we might be facing is the opposite. What if AI actually worked exactly as intended by the people who created AI? But their intentions\nwere either misguided, uncritical, not thought through.\nAnd things. Actually, we actually got what we wanted or what we thought we wanted. But then we realized, -oh, is this really what we want. And then it’s maybe a little too late to go back.\nyou know, before we throw out all the things like learning to write an essay learning to reason, learning to draw learning, to make music\nand saying, You know, yeah, I can do all of that. And and you know, and of course people are doing that, and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing to do. I’m just saying\nwhat if that wasn’t the only way people\nwent about what if people still learned, nonetheless.\nto write, to make music, to play ping pong, to draw, to paint.\nAnd it’s just like a video game. It’s like it’s like I\nI know I don’t want to hand over the Controller in Elden Ring to another, either another person or an AI to get through this boss for me, because the whole point of playing the game is, I’m trying to learn how\nto actually beat these bosses, to beat these levels, to get to actually beat the game, and then to do it on a harder difficulty, setting the new game pluses.\njust saying, Be careful what you wish for.\nand this is, say, why, the question, what do we really want from AI, I think, is actually, maybe one of the questions to ask right now is because\nwhat you think you want will end up expanding into what you do.\nThe Upanisha tells us you are what your deepest desire is, as your desire, so is your intention, as is your intention, so is your will, as your will, so is your deed, as is your deed, so is your destiny.\nThis is why that seed of desire, what you truly want. If you can get that\nright, or at least give yourself the best chance of giving that right, and leave yourself room for adjustment for critical thinking.\nI like to think that gives us a better chance at at a destiny that’s better for all.\nSpeaking of AI for all\nwhat I really want, and I’ll end with this. In these days of profound uncertainty about the future. I look at my daughter, who just turned one in every fiber of my person.\ntells me this as she grows, I would want her to learn to value and even embrace the difficulty, confusion, and frustration that comes with learning, and that reside inherent in the craft of creatively expressing oneself whatever form that may take, and for her to come to know the sublime joy hidden in the process, with or without. AI.\nI think that’s what I want, at least for my daughter in this age of AI, because at the end of the day what we make makes us culture does matter, especially for engineers.\nand I want to thank you all so much for having me.\n01:06:57\nThank you so much, Professor Wong. Let’s give Professor a round of applause for that deeply philosophical and meaningful talk. I mean, wow! Every time I hear you speak, Professor Wong. I learned something new, and I’m just grateful for the opportunity for you to speak with all of us at AI for all today.\nThank you. Thank you for being here. We did record the session students, and so we will be sharing the recording in our platform as long as professors. Okay, with that.\n01:07:27\nOkay, with that. Okay.\n01:07:28\nOkay, fantastic. And at this time we are going to transition to our final part of the day, which is our reflection sessions. I’m going to go ahead and put that in the chat, for all of our students feel free to continue to flood the chat with your gratitude for Professor Wong, and then we will transition to your reflection sessions right now, and your sessions start at in 1 min, so we’ll see you over there. Thank you so much.\n01:07:55\nThank you, Brooklyn. Thank you, Miriam. Thank you. Everyone. Thank you all.\n01:08:04\nThere you go!\n01:08:08\nThank you.\n01:08:23\nIf there is confusion, too, about.\n"},"03_resources/Programming-Advice":{"title":"Programming Advice","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Source: mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/\nA Bunch of Programming Advice I’d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago\nI finally have the feeling that I’m a decent programmer, so I thought it would be fun to write some advice with the idea of “what would have gotten me to this point faster?” I’m not claiming this is great advice for everyone, just that it would have been good advice for me.\nIf you (or your team) are shooting yourselves in the foot constantly, fix the gun\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve been on a team and there’s something about the system that’s very easy to screw up, but no one thinks about ways to make it harder to make that mistake.\nWhen I was doing iOS development, used CoreData, and subscribed to changes from a bunch of views. The subscription callback came on the same thread that the change was triggered from. Sometimes that was the main thread, and sometimes it was a background thread. Importantly in iOS development, you can only make UI updates on the main thread, or your app crashes. So a new subscription could be working fine, but then it would break when someone triggered a change from a background thread, or if you add a UI update later on.\nThis was just something people transparently accepted, and often came up in reviews for newer people on the team. Every now and then, one would slip through, and we’d go add a DispatchQueue.main.async when we saw the crash report.\nI decided to fix it, and it took ten minutes to update our subscription layer to call subscribers on the main thread instead, which eliminated a whole class of crashes, and a bit of mental load.\nI’m not trying to be like “look at these idiots not fixing an obvious issue with the codebase, when it was obvious to me”, because it would have been obvious to anyone who thought about it for a few minutes. These things stick around a weird amount, because there’s never a natural time to address them. When you’re first getting onboarded, you’re not trying to change anything big. So you may think it’s weird, but you shouldn’t go changing a bunch of things you’re still learning about. Then when you’ve been on the team for a while, it sort of fades into the background.\nIt’s a mindset shift. You just need to occasionally remind yourself that you are capable of making you and your team’s life easier, when these sorts of things are hanging around.\nAssess the trade-off you’re making between quality and pace, make sure it’s appropriate for your context\nThere’s always a trade-off between implementation speed and how confident you are about correctness. So you should ask yourself: how okay is it to ship bugs in my current context? If the answer to this doesn’t affect the way you work, you’re being overly inflexible.\nAt my first job, I was working on greenfield projects around data processing, which had good systems in place to retroactively re-process data. The impact of shipping a bug was very minor. The proper response to that environment is to rely on the guardrails a bit, move faster because you can. You don’t need 100% test coverage or an extensive QA process, which will slow down the pace of development.\nAt my second company, I was working on a product used by tens of millions of people, which involved high-value financial data and personally identifiable information. Even a small bug would entail a post-mortem. I shipped features at a snail’s pace, but I also think I may have shipped 0 bugs that year.\nUsually, you’re not at the second company. I’ve seen a lot of devs err on the side of that sort of programming though. In situations where bugs aren’t mission critical (ex. 99% of web apps), you’re going to get further with shipping fast and fixing bugs fast, than taking the time to make sure you’re shipping pristine features on your first try.\nSpending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it\nYou’re going to be renaming things, going to type definitions, finding references, etc a lot; you should be fast at this. You should know all the major shortcuts in your editor. You should be a confident and fast typist. You should know your OS well. You should be proficient in the shell. You should know how to use the browser dev tools effectively.\nI can already tell people are gonna be in the comments like “you can’t just spend all day tweaking your neovim config, sometimes you need to chop the tree too”. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone actually overdo this though; one of the biggest green flags I’ve seen in new engineers is a level of care in choosing and becoming proficient with their tools.\nIf you can’t easily explain why something is difficult, then it’s incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing\nMy favorite manager in my career had a habit of pressing me when I would claim something was difficult to implement. Often his response was something along the lines of “isn’t this just a matter of sending up X when we Y”, or “isn’t this just like Z that we did a couple months ago”? Very high level objections, is what I’m trying to say, not on the level of the actual functions and classes we were dealing with, which I was trying to explain.\nI think conventional wisdom is that it’s just annoying when managers simplify things like this. But a shockingly high percentage of the time, I’d realize when he was pressing me, that most of the complexity I was explaining was incidental complexity, and that I could actually address that first, thus making the problem as trivial as he was making it sound. This sort of thing tends to make future changes easier too.\nTry to solve bugs one layer deeper\nImagine you have a React component in a dashboard, that deals with a User object retrieved from state, of the currently logged in user. You see a bug report in Sentry, where user was null during render. You could add a quick if (!user) return null. Or you could investigate a bit more, and find that your logout function makes two distinct state updates – the first to set the user to null, the second to redirect to the homepage. You swap the two, and now no component will ever have this bug again, because the user object is never null while you’re within the dashboard.\nKeep doing the first sort of bug fix, and you end up with a mess. Keep doing the second type of bug fix, and you’ll have a clean system and a deep understanding of the invariants.\nDon’t underestimate the value of digging into history to investigate some bugs\nI’ve always been pretty good at debugging weird issues, with the usual toolkit of println and the debugger. So I never really looked at git much to figure out the history of a bug. But for some bugs it’s crucial.\nI recently had an issue with my server where it was leaking memory seemingly constantly, and then getting OOM-killed and restarted. I couldn’t figure out the cause of this for the life of me. Every likely culprit was ruled out, I couldn’t reproduce it locally, it felt like throwing darts blindfolded.\nI looked at the commit history, and found it started happening after I added support for Play Store payments. Never a place I would have looked in a million years, it’s just a couple http requests. Turns out it was getting stuck in an infinite loop of fetching access tokens, after the first one expired. Maybe every request only added a kB or so to memory, but when they’re retrying every 10ms on multiple threads, that adds up quick. And usually this sort of thing would have resulted in a stack overflow, but I was using async recursion in Rust, which doesn’t stack overflow. This never would have occurred to me, but when I’m forced to look into a specific bit of code that I know must have caused it, suddenly the theory pops up.\nI’m not sure what the rule is here for when to do this and when not to. It’s intuition based, a different sort of “huh” to a bug report that triggers this sort of investigation. You’ll develop the intuition over time, but it’s enough to know that sometimes it’s invaluable, if you’re stuck.\nAlong similar lines, try out git bisect if the problem is amenable to it — meaning a git history of small commits, a quick automated way to test for the issue, and you have one commit you know is bad and one that’s good.\nBad code gives you feedback, perfect code doesn’t. Err on the side of writing bad code\nIt’s really easy to write terrible code. But it’s also really easy to write code that follows absolutely every best practice, which has been unit, integration, fuzz, and mutation-tested for good measure – your startup will just run out of money before you finish. So a lot of programming is figuring out the balance.\nIf you err on the side of writing code quickly, you’ll occasionally get bitten by a bad bit of tech debt. You’ll learn stuff like “I should add great testing for data processing, because it’s often impossible to correct later”, or “I should really think through table design, because changing things without downtime can be extremely hard”.\nIf you err on the side of writing perfect code, you don’t get any feedback. Things just universally take a long time. You don’t know where you’re spending your time on things that really deserve it, and where you’re wasting time. Feedback mechanisms are essential for learning, and you’re not getting that.\nTo be clear I don’t mean bad as in “I couldn’t remember the syntax for creating a hash map, so I did two inner loops instead”, I mean bad as in:\n\nInstead of a re-write of our data ingestion to make this specific state unrepresentable, I added a couple asserts over our invariants, at a couple key checkpoints\n\n\nOur server models are exactly the same as the DTOs we would write, so I just serialized those, instead of writing all the boilerplate, we can write DTOs later, as needed\n\n\nI skipped writing tests for these components because they’re trivial and a bug in one of them is no big deal\n\nMake debugging easier\nThere’s so many little tricks I’ve acquired over the years on making software easier to debug. If you don’t make any effort to make debugging easy, you’re going to spend unacceptable amounts of time debugging each issue, as your software gets more and more complex. You’ll be terrified to make changes because even a couple new bugs might take you a week to figure out.\nHere’s some examples of what I mean:\n\nFor the backend of Chessbook\n\nI have a command to copy all of a user’s data down to local, so I can reproduce issues easily with only a username\nI trace every local request with OpenTelemetry, making it very easy to see how a request spends its time\nI have a scratch file that acts as a pseudo-REPL, which re-executes on every change. This makes it easy to pull out bits of code and play around with it to get a better idea what’s going on\nIn the staging environment, I limit parallelism to 1, so that it’s easier to visually parse logs\n\n\nFor the frontend\n\nI have a debugRequests setting which prevents optimistic loading of data, to make it easier to debug requests\nI have a debugState setting that will print out the entire state of the program after every update, along with a pretty diff of what changed\nI have a file full of little functions that get the UI into specific states, so that as I’m trying to fix bugs, I don’t have to keep clicking in the UI to get to that state.\n\n\n\nStay vigilant about how much of your debugging time is spent on setup, reproduction, and cleanup afterwards. If it’s over 50%, you should figure out how to make it easier, even if that will take slightly longer this time. Bugs should get easier to fix over time, all else being equal.\nWhen working on a team, you should usually ask the question\nThere’s a spectrum of “trying to figure out everything for yourself” to “bugging your coworkers with every little question”, and I think most people starting their careers are too far on the former side. There’s always someone around that has been in the codebase longer, or knows technology X way better than you, or knows the product better, or is just a more experienced engineer in general. There’s so many times in the first 6 months of working somewhere, where you could spend over an hour figuring something out, or you could get an answer in a few minutes.\nAsk the question. The only time this will be annoying to anyone, is if it’s clear you could have found the answer yourself in a few minutes.\nShipping cadence matters a lot. Think hard about what will get you shipping quickly and often\nStartups have limited runway. Projects have deadlines. When you quit your job to strike out on your own, your savings will only last you for so many months.\nIdeally, your speed on a project only compounds over time, until you’re shipping features faster than you could have imagined. To ship fast you need a lot of things:\n\nA system that isn’t prone to bugs\nQuick turnaround time between teams\nA willingness to cut out the 10% of a new feature that’s going to take 50% of the engineering time, and the foresight to know what those pieces are\nConsistent reusable patterns, that you can compose together for new screens/features/endpoints\nQuick, easy deploys\nProcess that doesn’t slow you down; flaky tests, slow CI, fussy linters, slow PR reviews, JIRA as a religion, etc.\nAbout a million other things\n\nShipping slowly should merit a post-mortem as much as breaking production does. Our industry doesn’t run like that, but that doesn’t mean you can’t personally follow the north star of Shipping Fast."},"03_resources/Rainbow-Six-Siege":{"title":"Rainbow Six Siege","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThis content is a portfolio showcase by artist Arman Akopian, featuring a collection of his artwork created for the video game Rainbow Six Siege over several years.

Transition from Academia to Industry\n\nAll panelists (Pieter Abbeel, Andrea Thomaz, Charlie Kemp) described their journeys from academic research to founding or leading robotics companies.\nThey emphasized the importance of timing, noting that advances in AI and robotics made commercialization more feasible in recent years.\nMaintaining ties to academia helps keep up with rapid technological changes.\n\n2. Company Focus and Market Choices\n\nCovariant (Abbeel): Focuses on AI-powered warehouse automation, especially robotic “hands” for handling objects.\nDiligent Robotics (Thomaz): Builds hospital robots (like Moxi) for workforce augmentation, handling transport tasks to support clinical staff.\nHello Robot (Kemp): Develops lightweight, compact mobile manipulators for assistive and research applications, aiming for real-world impact in homes and labs.\n\n3. Form Factor and Market Fit\n\nPanelists agreed that mobile manipulation (robots with arms and mobility) is the most valuable form factor for many real-world tasks.\nThe design should fit the environment and task—humanoid robots are not always necessary.\nReducing the need for environment modification (e.g., not requiring facility changes) lowers deployment friction and speeds adoption.\n\n4. Commercialization Challenges\n\nAcademic research often focuses on novel achievements, but real-world products must be reliable and robust.\nProductization and reliability are critical for user adoption, especially in sensitive environments like hospitals.\nFunding models have shifted: alongside traditional “scrappy startup” funding, there is now support for large-scale, long-term AI projects (inspired by OpenAI).\n\n5. Lessons Learned and Industry Trends\n\nThe biggest barrier to robotics adoption is often the status quo—robots must be clearly better than existing solutions.\nInstallation and integration costs (e.g., with elevators in hospitals) can be higher than the robot itself.\nThe panelists see a trend toward robots that can be deployed with minimal changes to their environment, which will accelerate adoption.\n\n6. Thoughts on Humanoid Robots and Automation\n\nThere is excitement and rapid progress in humanoid robotics, but panelists caution that physical and AI capabilities still lag far behind humans.\nMany tasks can be automated with simpler, non-humanoid robots.\nAutomation in controlled environments (like labs and factories) is easier and more advanced than in human-centric, dynamic spaces.\n\n7. Training the Next Generation\n\nFuture robotics experts need strong fundamentals, logical thinking, teamwork, and the ability to quickly test and iterate on ideas.\nProject-based learning and hands-on experience with real robots are highly valuable.\nThe rapid pace of change means students must learn how to learn and adapt.\n"},"03_resources/Skip-navigationSearchCreateAvatar-imageHow-to-Speak-Articulately":{"title":"Skip navigationSearchCreateAvatar imageHow to Speak Articulately","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"source www.youtube.com/watch\n1. Articulation CAN Be Improved\nThe video opens by emphasizing that anyone can become more articulate with practice and intention. Articulation is not an innate talent but a skill that can be developed. \n2. Embrace Silence\nPausing and allowing silence in your speech helps you gather your thoughts and speak more clearly. Silence is not something to fear; it gives your words more weight and helps avoid filler words. \n3. Build a Knowledge Base\nBeing articulate is easier when you have a strong foundation of knowledge. Read widely, learn deeply, and expose yourself to new ideas so you have more to draw from when you speak. \n4. Journal for Clarity\nWriting regularly helps clarify your thoughts. Journaling allows you to process ideas, organize your thinking, and express yourself more precisely when speaking. \n5. Leave Room for Inner Dialogue\nAllow yourself time to reflect and think before responding. This inner dialogue helps you articulate your thoughts more clearly and avoid speaking impulsively. \n6. Talk to the Voices\nAcknowledge and converse with the different “voices” or perspectives in your mind. This practice helps you understand your own thoughts better and communicate them more effectively. \nThese strategies together can help anyone become a more articulate and confident speaker."},"03_resources/Smallville---Generative-Agents-to-study-behavior":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe faculty talk introduces generative AI agents as a novel approach to simulating human behavior and societies. It highlights the limitations of traditional, rigid models and proposes leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create more dynamic and high-fidelity agents. The speaker details an architecture enabling agents to remember, plan, and reflect, demonstrated within a virtual world called Smallville. The talk then shifts to a more recent work focusing on creating accurate \\“digital twins\\” of real individuals through extensive, semi-structured interviews. These agents are validated by their ability to predict the attitudes and behaviors of their human counterparts. The presentation concludes with a discussion on critical ethical considerations, such as privacy and autonomy, and outlines future applications of generative agents in social science, policy design, and machine learning systems that can better reflect diverse societal values.\nKey Points\n\nProblem: Traditional human behavior models are rigid, limiting generalizability in simulations.\nOpportunity: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to create high-fidelity, general-purpose computational agents.\nKey Challenges: Achieving long-term behavioral coherence (memory, planning, reflection) and ensuring simulation accuracy.\nGenerative Agent Architecture:\n\nUses a \\“memory stream\\” (biased by recency, importance, relevance) to store perceptions.\nEmploys hierarchical planning (top-down, multi-granularity).\nIntegrates \\“reflections\\” for higher-level self-understanding and synthesis of memories.\nDemonstrated believability in a multi-agent social simulation (Smallville).\n\n\nGenerative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People (Digital Twins):\n\nFocuses on accurate simulation of real individuals, not just believability.\nMethodology: Conducted 2-hour voice-to-voice semi-structured interviews with 1,052 US participants using an AI interviewer to populate agent memories.\nValidation: Measured \\“normalized accuracy\\” by comparing agent predictions to human responses on surveys and A/B tests, showing interview data significantly improves accuracy.\nResult: Creation of the first \\“Agent Bank\\” of diverse generative agents.\n\n\nEthical Considerations: Emphasizes privacy, autonomy, IRB oversight, continuous auditing, and the right to withdraw consent.\nFuture Applications: Envisions AI agents as a scientific method for societal decision-making, aiding in the design of social computing systems (e.g., Subreddits) and developing machine learning systems that incorporate diverse human values (e.g., \\“Jury Learning\\”).\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/q5C9QfRMdlsYsUj7VoGOHokWDXgDBEeiNFy2VaMOO42KpG4LQtje6ZGS6RHYDu—Xc-1mkShLOnRiiM.BiDHFsIDPm0i-ars?eagerLoadZvaPages=&amp;accessLevel=meeting&amp;canPlayFromShare=true&amp;from=share_recording_detail&amp;continueMode=true&amp;componentName=rec-play&amp;originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2Fqh9oeWIwYtM8ovc8m7bKViysmHvPjtbbxjnctAl_5oucXRJxV59POK10EtU5Yjk.pQSRZ4pJTpRlKEiP\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 00:59:04\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:04\nIt’s\nI’m not sure if anyone’s been in coda or at least folks from High may have been to coda. It’s getting a room to give talks, and has gotten very competitive. So apologies that I sort of am moving the location here a little bit. Yeah, but really nice meeting. Everyone is everyone sort of and just so I know the audience. Everyone’s joining. And you’re sort of all in high school and stuff like that right now. Is that right?\n00:28\nYep.\n00:30\nExciting, all right. Well, I’m excited to talk to you all arising sophomores. Yes.\n00:35\nFantastic. So it seems like we have a bit of a range.\n00:39\nSo I’m excited to talk to you. And I thank you so much, Mariam, for the really wonderful introduction. Yeah, excited to talk to you all about agents and generative AI, and so forth. So I would love to sort of make this as interactive as you all want this to be. So feel free to stop me whenever. But\njust to make sure that you all can see the talk.\nOkay, if I do this, what can you see? Can you see the the slides.\n01:11\nYes.\n01:12\nOkay? So I give that I sort of start to talk. But yeah, feel free to stop me. If you have any questions, feel free to just shout in the chat, let me just make sure that the chat window is open, so I can see what everyone’s typing.\nGreat rising software is from all over the world. I love it cool.\nSo Hi, everyone again. My name is June. Maybe there’s a small update in my status. I have officially graduated. So thank you. Thank you. So now I guess I feel older than even I used to be. But I guess that’s just that’s the context. But yeah, it’s really excited to be here. So I got my Phd in the computer Science Department at Stanford.\nAnd 2 show you that we’ve now reached a meaningful starting point for developing high fidelity, simulations of individuals and societies that bring us closer to realizing these visions.\nOkay?\nAnd I want to start our conversation here.\nSo what you’re seeing here is a grid world with red and blue squares, you might think of it as representing a hypothetical mixed neighborhood of red and blue.\nNow these squares, or agents, as we might call them, are perfectly happy living in a mixed neighborhood, or even in a community where they’re the minority.\nTheir only real preference is that they don’t want to be a significant minority.\nSo concretely they want to live in a location where at least 30% of their neighbors are of the same color as them, and if this condition isn’t met they’ll simply move to the closest location that is acceptable.\nBut here’s a catch.\nDespite a very weak preference, this collective process will lead to the emergence of a clear segregation. As you see here.\nThis is Thomas Schelling’s Nobel Prize-winning work on agent-based models. Specifically his 1971 model of segregation, and this simulation of it’s a simple, highly stylized one, challenged our assumption.\nBut this simulation showed that every weak, even very weak, preferences to be near people similar to you is sufficient to produce aggregation. And in the years that followed this simulation inspired policies like inclusive zoning and mixed income housing that are still, in effect, today.\nare built on assumptions about human behavior, and sometimes those assumptions are misguided\nsimulations, if designed right, I want to argue, can help us challenge those assumptions and push us to ask what-if counterfactuals to imagine different explanations and solutions for the problems facing individuals and societies.\nThey depend on countless idiosyncratic factors of the individuals and the environment. But the models of human behavior we had in previous decades were rigid.\nThey were defined by just a few highly stylized parameters, oversimplifying and restricting agents to specific domains, and this made the pictures painted by these simulations hard to generalize.\nSo I posit that with the right method they can be transformed into the core ingredient that have been missing in the past decades to create general purpose, computational agents that are capable of powering complex high fidelity simulations.\nBut there are 2 main challenges that we had to overcome for that to be possible.\nOne is that of long-term coherence. People live for many decades, and we can constantly see and make sense of things.\nbut testing a large language model to reason over all that experience, for every single decision is not only extremely inefficient, it’s also right now simply not possible.\nSo even with the expanding context window of these models, we might at most fit a day or 2 worth of detailed experiences.\nSo the question is, how can we augment the language model to empower agents that remember, reflect, and plan based on their experiences.\nAnd then there is the question of accuracy for these simulations to truly inform important decisions. They need to be not just, believable.\nbut accurate. Creating agents that are accurate requires a foundation and ground truth, and for individual agents that ground. Truth ought to come from real individuals. But what’s the right method for creating agents that can represent a diverse group of real individuals and validate them?\nIf you simply give a length, model my demographic information and my status as a graduate student.\nor now a graduate of the graduate program, something like a 30 year old Asian graduate student in computer science, and it produces descriptions like June will be in his office writing a paper on Monday morning. It writes for lunch and stay indoors all day. Is this accurate, or is that just a broad, stereotypical generalizations?\nSo today I’m going to show you how we can overcome these challenges and demonstrate that we can now, indeed create general computational agents, that leverage generative AI models like Chatgpt\nto accurately simulate the attitudes and behaviors of individuals across a wide range of context.\nThese agents, I’ll demonstrate.\ncan not only plan and lead a believable day in life where they wake up in the morning, do their routines and go to work as individuals as in a sandbox game environment with no hard-coded scripts.\nbut they can also come together to give birth to an entirely artificial society of their own, like this.\nOkay.\nso and so, this is actually the demo that we actually have created as a part of this research. So I don’t know how many of you actually played like games like the Sims pokemon all these kind of games.\nAnd so it might be very reminiscent of those kind of platforms. So we actually create a game. So this is actually what you get to do. If you’re a researcher in this space, you get to create games. But except Npcs are now live, and they talk to each other and have relationships. And we name these generative agents\nand these generative agents. I’m going to suggest open up new opportunities in the way we understand individuals and our societies.\nOkay.\nso that’s sort of the work that we do in the lab, and basically go over a couple of papers in this space.\nhonestly, like, you know, and depending on sort of where all of your interest is, I’m happy to focus on one or the other, and so forth. And so yeah, feel free to just jump in and ask questions or stop me as I go. But otherwise, for the rest of today’s talk, I basically show you\nhow you can create digital friends that live in Sims basically and try to convince you that that is actually a useful research question. For for, like graduate student like myself to pursue.\nOkay, so\nI’m going to orient my talk around 2 of the works that I built during my Phd. The 1st is called generative Agents, interactive simulacra of human behavior. In this work I present what is one of the very 1st agent architectures in the field to basically leverage the Lors Lynch model for creating agents and demonstrate that these agents can generate believable behaviors for fictional characters.\nThen, in our latest work, generative agent simulations of 1,000 people, I’ll demonstrate how we can extend this generative agent architecture to accurately model a real representative sample of American individuals.\nSo let me start with generative agents. This is work that was published at Wist in 2023,\nand in this portion of the talk the plan is to work up to the generative agent architecture that you see here, which I’m going to show is necessary for creating compelling agent behavior.\nBut before I do, I do want to 1st show you what it can do.\nso let me officially welcome you to Smallville. What you see here is a map of a game world called Smallville.\nthat we developed to grant the behaviors and interactions of our agents.\nand we populated this space with 25 generative agents, each with distinct identities that we’ve given them described in one paragraph of English sentences.\nFor instance, we told Isabella that she is the owner of Hubs Cafe, who loves to make people out, loves to make people feel welcome, and that she is planning to organize a Valentine’s Day party.\nand with that as the only human input we aim to simulate behaviors for these agents.\nFor instance, here’s what Isabella’s typical day looks like. In broad strokes she wakes up early and completes her morning routine around 6 A. M. And she prepares to open the cafe by 8.\nShe notices and interacts with her customers throughout the day, perhaps even inviting them to the party that she is planning. And around 6 Pm. Her working day ends with her going to a local store to buy supplies.\nand in close-up we can see that these broad stroke behaviors are composed of smaller sequences of actions that impact and alter the game world environment.\nIf, for instance, Isabella outputted a high-level behavior to make and drink coffee.\nshe would 1st clean her cup, then change the status of the coffee machine to be turned on and occupy one of the empty chairs in her cafe as she waits for her coffee to finish brewing.\nSo take a look at this interaction between Latoya and Sam, for instance. So this is actually the conversation they had throughout the day. Right? So they met at this park, and at the start of the simulation, wanting to notice that these 2 do not have any prior information about each other.\nSo the 1st time they meet is while taking a walk in a park. They introduce themselves, and Latiya tells Sam that she is taking photos for a project that she’s working on.\nAnd the next day, when Sam sees Latoya again, he remembers her as well as her project, and asks, How’s your project going? To which Latoya responds, Hi, Sam, it’s going well.\nbut that’s not all. In Smallville. You do not have to be a mere passive observer of these generative agents. Instead, you can interact with them. You can change their environment. You can burn their toast and watch them, to rush, to put out the fire and remake their breakfast like you see here, for this is Wolfka. So he woke up in the morning. He was making toast, and he decided to burn it or put it on fire. So you’re basically seeing him cleaning up, you can sort of see the small emojis to show what he’s actually up to.\nor commend the agents by rewriting their memories to plant new ideas like here, where we told John that he’s now running for an office.\nSo how do we achieve this agent behavior?\nWhat makes gender loop agents possible today is the development of large language models. But, as I pointed out earlier, these models with prompting alone have pretty dramatic limitations.\nAnd that’s what generative agent architecture is. And here’s how this works.\nFirst, st we translate the perceptual stimuli of an agent into natural language sentences. For instance, if in the case of what Isabella perceives at her cafe, it’s phrases like Maria is chatting with Klaus, or the chair is empty, and so forth.\nThen we store these sentences in their natural language format in a long-term memory module that we call the memory stream. So what you see here is the tip of Isabella’s memory stream. In practice this is a very lengthy document.\nbut now the challenge here is that this memory stream is too large to efficiently fit into the context window of a large language model, and even if you could feeding the entire memory stream would distract the model and make it terribly inefficient.\nSo we retrieve from it only a small subset of the memories that are most relevant to responding to the agent’s current situation.\nSo when Isabella is asked, What are you excited about? She might retrieve memories that are about her Valentine’s Day party.\nHere’s how we designed this system. So in our architecture. We designed it as a combination of recency, importance, and relevance function for each piece of memory.\nSo basically, we bias towards retrieving memories that are more recent, important and relevant\nin our work. The recency function is implemented as an exponential decay function, and the importance function is a prompt that asks the link model for an event saliency and the relevance function is a cosine similarity measure of the embeddings of the current context and the description of a memory.\nWe then use the retrieved memories to generate plans and reflections, using the language model which are then translated into the concrete actions that you see in the environment.\nNow let me dive deeper into the planning and reflection modules here, since these are the core modules for generating agent behaviors.\nSo 1st planning.\nplanning, and planning and agents has been around for a long time, especially in robotics and so forth. So here we’re not necessarily trying to say this is the best thing one could ever possibly do. But just to demonstrate that we can now do it this way.\nand planning from generative agents is quite useful, because without it. The language model is quite prone to optimizing for believability in the moment at the cost of believability over time.\nSo a very simple example in this of this failure is an agent deciding to eat lunch at 1130, which is reasonable, but then deciding to eat lunch again at noon, and again at 1230, because any of those times are reasonable time for lunch\nin our work. We generate the plans by prompting a link model with a prompt that summarizes the agent and the agent’s current status, as you see here for Eddie.\nOkay.\nnow, a challenge here is controlling for the granularity of the plans that are getting generated in our work. We address this by taking a top-down approach where we recursively generate more plans and more details in the plan.\nSo here’s an example. On the left-hand side is Eddie’s plan, generated in broad strokes, dividing his day into roughly 7 chunks.\nWe then decompose these trunks, 1st into an hourly schedule, and then into 5 to 15 min actions, as you see on the right hand side.\nOnce we’ve reached the desired granularity, which is in our case, one action every 10 seconds or so of the game time. They act out their plans in the game world.\nbut sometimes the agents may need to change their plans. For instance, if Eddie’s father, John, records that he sees Eddie taking a short walk in the house garden, he might decide to start an impromptu conversation.\nAnd now let’s talk about the reflections.\nThis was a practical, interesting module for us, and here’s the motivation behind it.\nImagine you asked an agent who would you want to hang out with the most\nagents. Without this reflection, Module would retrieve all the memories about other agents, and record and respond with the one they see the most often, not the one they have the closest relationship with, but the one that who lives maybe next door in their dorm, or something like that.\nAnd that didn’t seem quite right. So to address this, we started asking agents to retrieve specific memories and begin formulating reflections about themselves. So these are basically their shower thoughts.\nSo over time, these agents start to generate these trees of reflections. The leaf nodes are basically the observations, and the non-leaf nodes are thoughts that become higher level higher up the tree. They are. So here’s 1 for Klaus.\nSo you actually see at the very bottom, like the raw observation he made about himself right? He is reading about gentrification and urban design.\nBut then that gets mapped onto a thought or sort of a synthesis of those observations. Right? So. Oh, maybe Klaus spends a lot of time reading, and this get combined into another sort of set of reflections and observations, and at the very top you start to see something that’s much more fundamental about Klaus that defines who he is right. Or maybe he’s highly dedicated to research.\nSo is this agent architecture successful in generating human behavior.\nIn this portion of my talk, I’m going to measure what we call believability of these agents, which has been a long-term research and engineering goal in our field.\nEspecially do these agents exhibit behaviors that are plausible.\nNow I do want to put a highlight on this concept of believability, though, because in the next portion of my talk I’ll demonstrate that we can design these agents. So their behaviors are not only believable, but also measurably accurate.\nBut for now, to evaluate the agent’s believability, we leveraged a methodological opportunity by interviewing them in natural language.\nso to respond believably, the agents must successfully retrieve and make sense of their memories.\nWe then task our agents, a generative agent, architecture along with a bunch of ablated architectures and human crowd workers role playing as these agents to answer the questions. And when I say ablated architectures for those of you who’s not familiar with the term\nthat basically means on the architecture might have a different component. You’re turning off each component one by one. So you know which component matters the most right? So that’s how I so. Basically oh, what if we make the agent unable to remember, unable to reflect, and unable to plan all those kind of things?\nAnd what we find is that the generative agent architectures that are generative agents that are fully equipped with the architecture that I proposed here produce behavior that is significantly more believable than both Chatgpt and other ablated architectures, and even the human crowd workers.\nand to study the emergent societal behaviors we track how Isabella’s Valentine’s Day party develops what we find is that over time in the simulation, Isabella invites 12 agents to the party, and even enlists Maria to help decorate the cafe, and later that day Maria in turn asks Klaus her secret crush to go to the party with her.\nOkay?\nAnd on the day of Valentine’s, despite many potential points of failure. Right, Isabella must remember to invite others to the prairie attendees must remember the invitation. Those who remembers must decide to actually show up, and more. Our agents succeed to coordinate as we might. So 5 agents here, including Maria and Klaus, actually show up at Hobbs Cafe to enjoy the festivities, while others choose not to or to simply forget, as we sometimes do in real life.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nso the developer community and the public have really embraced this idea. Open source repo that we launched for generative agents became the fastest growing Github Repository in the entire world during its 1st week, and it helped shape many of the agenting software systems that are powered by lynch models.\nAnd what’s been particularly exciting for me is that this has inspired some really exciting research agendas that are just starting to shape out.\nWe are also seeing generative agents offering safe rehearsal spaces for students and educators in topics that are ranging from conflict resolution to other scenarios that require interactive activities.\nAnd we’re seeing generative agents open up new ways to study interventions for societal challenges, such as systematic racism by illustrating the causal mechanisms and outcomes of policies, especially in cases where comprehensive longitudinal data is not available.\nOkay, so that was generative agents, interactive simulatra of human behavior.\nAnd just to summarize this work made one of the very 1st architectural contributions to creating agents using a large Lynch model.\nIt demonstrated a multi-agent societal simulation.\nand we evaluated them for their believability by interviewing them.\nNow let’s pause here for a second. Now actually, I do want to. So the next portion of this talk is basically me talking about like going beyond believability to basically create one. We might also even consider to be like digital twins of real people, basically accurate simulations of individuals.\nBut before I do, let me actually briefly pause here and see if there’s any questions in the room that I can answer. I see one question that that Audrey asked in the chat, so maybe I’ll start by just answering that, and then, and then I can go on to the next portion of the talk.\nOkay? So just to quickly answer. So Audrey asked\nmedical AI track for this camp and the simulation you showed about the Npcs living in and building relationship prompted me to wonder in the context of AI in medicine. Can we simulate the impact of one’s environment on one’s health over a prolonged period of time.\nSo I think this is actually quite interesting. There’s actually a lot of interesting conversations that people are having about basically medicine. So in one individual.\nthe 1st question is, the 1st answer is likely, yeah, especially if these models are sort of equipped with how some of the illness might propagate one research that actually have come across my table recently\nSo I believe it was this paper. So I actually had some colleagues who created. So we remember that we created this sort of game world that I just showed you. We had a colleague who basically created something like this.\nSo this is a recent paper\nthey’re calling it infected Smallville. So they basically took our game map of Smallville that I just showed you. But it basically spread. But they basically implemented some kind of illness like Covid, and something like that\nto basically see. Oh, if there is, let’s say this influenza. So I guess in this case it’s h 1 n. One epidemic, how people’s reaction differ and how the illness spread over time. Right?\nSo that’s actually some of the research that’s actually going on so kind of things that people are studying is oh, right? So if there is epidemic that’s going on, maybe less people will show up at this party compared to. This is, I think, what we had in our in our work, where we had more people show up at this party.\nAnd then, obviously, you can also do these kind of things? Where? How would people travel like? Would people still go to the market to buy supplies? If there’s epidemic they might, but much less so than, let’s say, when there’s no threat condition. So there are some of these kind of works that’s going on in this space, which I think is exciting and sort of interesting.\nOkay?\nAnd let’s see.\nMichael also asked, were sort of the pixel art characters necessary for the experiment? Or were they just a cute artistic touch. It’s a good question. I mean, what is necessary. I mean, I think fun is necessary in my view, and I think we are sort of big part. I don’t know. The team is a big fan of these kind of small games, so we wanted to have fun. So it turns out that. Yes, it’s okay to have fun in professional research, too.\nBut it’s a good question like, was it necessary? Not really, in in a way.\nright. The core capability that you’re showing is that these agents can really behave and live in these kind of environments. So was the game environment necessary, like absolutely necessary. No. Now\ndid the game environment. And having that visceral demo really change the way we communicated this capability to the rest of society. Yes.\nright? So one way that people in my field often sort of\nactually one really good example. Actually, this, this is actually very common to the extent that this is interesting to all of you, especially if you’re thinking up down the line when you’re going to, you know. Go start your college career. If you’re interested in research and like computer science. And these kind of things.\none common tactic that some of research community, like some members of my community, like to deploy\nis to basically create simulations or to basically demonstrate technology in context that people are deeply familiar with like games. So you may have seen how many of you. I don’t know how easy it is to do like raise hands or something like that, but I’m guessing. Many of you have seen things like the deep minds like, you know, AI, that can play go chess. And these kind of things.\nYes.\nyeah, I’ve seen and seen some thumbs up right? People have also implemented things like Starcraft agent and those kind of things.\nNow, the reason why you do that is basically to demonstrate that we can create technology that can basically play these games. Now.\ndoes it really matter? Is the end use case of this technology just to play those games? No, right? That’s not in the end. The use case of this technology is not to have them play the games.\nbut where they are really useful is, everyone plays these games. So we viscerally understand what it means, like what it takes for these agents to be able to play these kind of games. Now, the kind of like Sims like this kind of game world that’s really interesting. Because\nthat world basically replicates our world. Sims is basically designed after like human world. So if an agent can live in there. Then they’ll really start to viscerally show to the rest of the community where the technology is that these agents can maybe actually live in this kind of world.\nAnd that’s super exciting. So this is a really good way to demonstrate power of technology. And it has been a common tactic that many members of my community have leveraged and also sort of you know, it’s again, it’s also fun. I think there’s actually a lot of games that actually got developed based on this paper. So a lot of game companies are now trying to implement these Npcs. Do I think of it as like the core use case of generative agents. Maybe not.\nIs that fun? Yeah, that’s always good.\nOkay, let me answer a few more questions here. How does the memory, retrieval and reflection. Pipeline differ from traditional rag. It’s a good question. It’s very similar, right? So actually.\nthe the memory architecture that you see here basically came out roughly the same time as when Reg got introduced right. So this was 1 1 of the very early works that actually introduced this kind of system of doing retrieval.\nin the sense that the kind of thing that we’re trying to do is like do reflection. So it’s not just about retrieving memories that are the most relevant. But we’re trying to retrieve memories that are relevant to that particular person, right? Things that are memorable.\nSo if you’re trying to build a Google search engine, I mean, maybe that’s not the best example. But right? That’s what Reck often gets used for what you want to retrieve is memories that are sort of the most relevant to your current context\nhere. That might not actually be the case, because sometimes we do remember, like people remember useless things right? The one breakfast that you had that like really, really sunny like in the morning, and something like that. Then.\nfor whatever reason, was very memorable to you, remember those kind of things. So the goal of what you are trying to retrieve could actually differ here a little bit. Right? So that’s how it differs. But philosophically very similar.\nOkay, Addison asked, what is the greatest unresolved challenge in taking generative agents from fascinating simulations to really reliable and ethically integrated real world applications.\nSo this is the part that could actually be a really great segue for the sort of next portion of the talk which is to show that these are not just believable. But they’re accurate simulation of human behavior. So one of the ways that we actually do get do see, these agents potentially having a really large impact\nThat’s a really difficult task.\nAnd what my colleagues in that space and this also at Stanford, we have a bunch of like political scientists are the kind of thing that they want to study is well, what kind of intervention or messaging can we put out to actually reduce that polarization? Very hard question to answer? What they do is they actually put out a bunch of interventions. What if we use this kind of strategy? What if we change the algorithm this way\nto test any one of those is very expensive and slow. So they if they have 100 different ideas, they get to test, maybe 2 or 3 right, and they run out of budget and time.\nIf we can do that in simulation.\nyou can basically test all 100 within the matter of a couple of hours, maybe.\nOkay, I’ll maybe answer just one last question that got asked, and then just quickly go over the rest of the slides, and then I can come back to some of the questions again at the end. Do they know they’re just characters in a game? Or will they realize that in the future?\nYeah, good question, who knows? Maybe we are living in a game? So yeah, at some point we should ask these agents if they know that there are game characters. It’s a fun question to ask. These agents\nis simulation theory real?\nI guess that’s that’s yeah, we’re fine now, but cool. So let me go back to my slides quickly.\nOkay, so hopefully, you can all see my slides again.\nSo the next part that I sort of want to discuss and sort of present. Here is the latest work in this space that we call the generative agent simulations of 1,000 people. And this is where we take the 1st step in answering these questions.\nSo this work is a preprint. So it’s still under review. But it has sort of received a lot of attention in this area. I think it’s it’s a really fun one to talk about.\nSo in this one, what I’m going to focus on is individuals. So I’m basically going to demonstrate to you that we can now create generative agents that can simulate the attitudes and behaviors of a real diverse group of individuals. So basically, can we create. So in the previous paper, I created like these fictional Npcs. Now, I’m trying to turn one of all of you may be down the line into agents or into not Npcs, but agents that basically can be like a digital tune of who you are.\nand then to validate the agent’s accuracy by and then we want to validate this agent’s accuracy right? And we do that by testing them with predicting their source, individuals, attitudes, and behaviors. So that’s the test.\nAnd here’s why we want to do this.\nMy underlying argument here is that the stronger, the more general the model of individuals, the more persuasive the conclusions are of those simulations.\nSo how do we do this? How can we create generative agents of real individuals.\nOop.\nOkay, here we go.\nNow.\nif you’re sort of familiar with the budding literature, actually, maybe maybe this is more academic side of me talking so maybe I can be a little bit more at a high level. So you may have used things like Chatgpt or character AI, and so forth.\nYou may have noticed that you can actually ask Chatgpt, hey? Pretend to be. I don’t know. Input your famous like, your favorite movie character.\nChatgpt actually will do a pretty good job right that it can pretend to be that person. It can role, play it as that person. In the similar way, you can basically ask Chatgpt\nto basically give it like, very simple, like a persona or like demographic information. Hey? So imagine you wanted to role play as me, you can say, Hey, what would a 30 year old Asian male living in Palo Alto do in this kind of context? Right? So you could do that now the problem of doing that\nis, it produces very simplified and stereotypical behaviors, which sometimes is not a bad thing, right? It’s making its best guesses. So if it says, Hey, June is a graduate student in computer science, and the guy is never going to leave his office to see. You know the sun\nin some, you know, average day. That might actually be true. Right? So it’s not necessarily a totally wrong thing to say. But at the same time people are very unique, and they have what we might consider to be very idiosyncratic features that might not get captured by these kind of demographic information.\nSo here’s my view.\nPeople contain myriad idiosyncratic factors that can’t easily be summarized by their demographic attributes or a short persona description.\nand as much as we might hope for a clever trick to solve this. The reality is, there’s no shortcut to really learning and representing these factors.\nSo what I end up doing in these work is, I interview people.\nOkay.\nAnd that’s exactly the kind of thing that we need when we are trying to learn about the lives of people and anchor the behaviors of generative agents.\nOkay.\nso let me go a little bit more in depth into how exactly we’ve done this in our study.\nSo we actually started by recruiting human participants. So these are not agents. These are actual people. And you know, down the line. You’re also welcome to be our participants and join our study. But for this study we actually partner with Bovitz, which is a recruitment firm, and we gathered a representative sample of 1,052 individuals from the Us.\nWe then conducted 2 h voice-to-voice, semi-structured interviews with each participant using an interview script that was developed by our colleagues for American Voices project.\nand 2 things that are worth noting here. First, st the interview script is intentionally very broad and open-ended. So the 1st question we literally ask is something like, Tell me the story of your life.\nin the second, this interview script is completely independent from us, as well as from the surveys and experiments we are using to validate the agents.\nSo this AI interviewer was designed to facilitate real-time voice-to-voice interviews with participants, and within the time limit it could also ask follow-up questions, or steer the conversation in unscripted but meaningful ways.\nSo this is what it looked like. So, yeah, so this is the interviewer. So you actually see, that’s actually Isabella, who used to be the cafe owner in the previous paper that you that I just presented. But now she goes around and talk to a bunch of people for 2 h is basically the idea.\nWhat we and what we get out of this is actually really rich qualitative information about people.\nRight?\nSo here you actually see some of these\nOkay.\nthen we took these interview transcripts and used them to anchor the agent’s behaviors. So basically interview transcript populates the agent’s memories.\nSo to address this, we ask each participant to complete our battery twice 2 weeks apart.\nSo what do we find?\nAnd we also do quite well on something like a randomized controlled trials or a B testing. These are basically studies where you basically show people a bunch of different conditions and ask them to compare those conditions. Right? Oh, imagine I got. Let’s say, agents don’t drink coffee. So coffee is actually not a really good idea, or it’s not a best example, but gets the message across.\nHow awake do you feel when you drink coffee versus not those kind of things can be a really good example of kind of like a B testing. And we predict those results quite well\nand turns out, interview really does help in bridging the gap.\nRight?\nThe intuition here\nis that if you have interview data, we basically get what we might consider to be long tail information about the person.\nSo some of our participants basically come back and say, Hey, I recently recovered from cancer. That’s actually something that one of our participants mentioned in the interview turns out, if we know that we likely know their like financial stability, we likely know their outlook on health and well-being so ends up being very predictive of their behaviors.\nSo intuition again, here is interview when you combine it with something like generative agents, is very powerful way of modeling people.\nAnd this is actually the 1st way that we actually have now to basically create models of not groups or populations, but of individual people to actually create like digital twins of one individual.\nAnd when you put together, what we basically create is basically this kind of agent bank, right? So as a part of this study. What we’ve created is 1,000 generative agents that represent a real diverse group of individuals, and collectively they make up the 1st Agent bank of its kind.\nand we believe that this Agent Bank provides the right foundation for building future research and simulations.\nSo this is something that we work with. Irb. So Irb stands for institutional Review board. So if you ever get to do research as a part of university nowadays, all universities have their own Irb program. So they are basically experts in ethics and safety, and so forth, that work with you to basically make sure that you draft a system and sort of a proposal that can make sure that we safeguard our participants and subjects. So the kind of things that we do\nhere is we basically control different access point to the agent bank. So instead of letting anyone just access this agent bank at random, right? We continuously audit these kind of system to see what kind of questions actually get asked to these agents and\nbasically letting our participants then be able to pull their consent from the agent bank so they can say, Oh, I do not want my data to be represented in this agent bank anymore. Then we put their data. So those are the kind of things kind of things that we do and that we work with as a part of this research program. So maybe another way of saying it is being a researcher\ntoday goes beyond thinking about the scientific progress of the field, and then to almost envision, like at really the cutting edge, envisioning what the policy and what the mechanism ought to be to basically create a field that can really be beneficial and impactful for the rest of the society\nwhile minimizing the potential risks that the field might present right? And every technology that is powerful certainly present many kinds of risk. Right? AI has its own set of risks certainly is the case for simulation and thinking about those areas critically is one of the one of the core activities of researchers today.\nNow I do want to sort of reflect on what kind of work that you might see, as these fields sort of develop down the line.\nIf we stay vigilant with safety and ethics, and so forth. I really do believe that in the coming years AI. Agents and simulations will become a distinct scientific method that really empowers to reason about societal decisions.\nAnd we’ve already seen concrete evidence that simulations can indeed support this. So just to highlight just a couple of ideas here that we worked on.\nAnd and then we found that giving designers the ability to simulate communities really does help them anticipate opportunities and challenges within their communities.\nFor instance, they identified unexpected model citizen behaviors like impromptu franticking for sightseeing a community focused on sharing fun events around Pittsburgh, and they also uncovered unexpected, undesirable behaviors like troll farms, shifting the tone of a discussion community\nright?\nAnd if you can simulate individuals, you can also create machine learning systems that more closely reflect the diversity of values when making decisions on our behalf.\nSo we had this project called jury learning.\nAnd basically, we observed that in many places where machine learning classifiers are deployed like deciding what content should be considered toxic or harmful.\nThere’s actually a lot of underlying disagreement within the human population about what the right decision ought to be.\nBut today’s machine learning systems largely ignore these disagreements, and for the most part take a majoritarian perspective by simply aggregating aggregating annotators, labels into a single label.\nBut if you can model the attitudes and behaviors of individual annotators. You can instead specify juries\nthat will push us to explicitly articulate what proportion of the jury should represent each group and intersectional identity.\nand in practice this process often encourages communities to recognize the voices of historically silenced minority groups. So when we applied this in a field experiment for content moderation. The communities in our study often chose to amplify the voices of minority groups that are affected by online harms.\nRight? So just to sum up today I introduce you to the concept and method of using generative AI like Chatgpt to create agents and simulate human behavior. I also showed how my work aims to build a scientific foundation for these simulations that are grounded in models of individuals.\nAnd I hope you’re starting to see the threads that connect my work. Our lives are full of complex and important societal decisions, and this new generation of simulations, powered by generative agents gives us a powerful new tool, a new opportunity to make sense of these decisions.\nAnd in saying this, of course, I’m not suggesting that these simulations are perfect or that they’ll ever be. But what I am saying is that there are so many problems these simulations can help us tackle. And I believe this is a research agenda that is worth pursuing.\nI do see Teresa’s hand, so maybe I’ll let Teresa ask a question, and then, if we have time I can circle back to some other questions in the chat as well.\n51:56\nThank you very much. Just a quick question. I’m just kind of curious, like how you store all the data.\n52:03\nRight. You mean this for the generative agents.\n52:06\nYeah.\n52:07\nYeah, so surprisingly, we actually store all the data basically in a large text file, that’s actually the beauty of generative AI right in the past. We actually had to encode all this data in some smart like encoding and vector embeddings. And so forth. Nowadays, we can actually store like literally like txt file and agents can act on that.\nThat’s what we do, obviously for doing sort of the retrieval system. We do, then transform some of this into vector embedding for those of you less familiar with that concept. That basically means you’re\nyou’re basically turning like text into numbers, like where the vector is is how we call it to make sure the machine can urse it. But that’s what we do.\nOkay?\nSo maybe I can answer.\nif anyone wants to raise their hand and ask a question, happy to answer them otherwise let me see if there’s any question in the text.\nOh, Aaron.\n53:05\nHave you ever tried simulating human evolution.\n53:09\nIt’s a good question.\nSo not human. So we’ve run simulation for about 2, 3 days. I think that’s the longest simulation that we had, but I think down the line. I agree like that the much longer simulation where we let these agents literally like simulate many, many years of human existence, I think, could be really interesting.\nSome, I think researchers are actually interested in doing that right now. I do think it’s scientifically. It’s a little bit early to really be able to do that. But I think it’s it’s a path.\nAlex.\n53:40\nYeah, okay, I’m Alex. So you mentioned that these generative AI agents can become like more and more lifelike. So I was just wondering, like, what if people use them to like, let’s say, do interviews, or to scam people. So how do you think like you can actually differentiate between an actual person and the generative AI agent.\n54:00\nYeah. So this is, I think, a really important question. And I also think this is where we as a society, need to have a normative position on what is acceptable and what is not.\nNow, good actors like good developers, will follow that rule. But obviously there’s always the bad actors. And the question is, what do we do about them? This is where I think, at the system level that we continuously need to be auditing these systems to make sure that these agents are doing things that we’re okay with as a society.\nBut I think it’s also it’s a tricky one right? Because down the line, I mean, these are the kind of things that we do need to respond to, especially what do we do when there are truly bad developers and bad actors that are trying to misuse these kind of systems. So it’s a good question. Hopefully, we as a society, have enough defense mechanism that we will gradually learn how to tackle these kind of problems.\nAnd maybe I’ll take one last question. Carolyn or Caroline.\n55:03\nYeah. Hi, I really enjoyed the presentation. It was really interesting.\nBut in the future, do you see? Like generative agents being accurate enough to like, predict, or like play, exactly what somebody will do or like. Think\nfor like strategy games such as like chess and like, how do you think this will affect sports.\n55:22\nRight. So sports are you thinking here more of like, literally like the I don’t know, like soccer tennis like these kind of sports or sports, more like the mental sports like poker, and those kind of things.\n55:35\nI think\nspecific, like strategy based sports. So I I fence. So I was thinking more like stuff like that.\n55:44\nso here suddenly. If it’s strategic games. I do think these agents will also get better at those, and hopefully there will be an interesting co-pilot as people try to develop their games and so forth. I do think it’s an open-ended question as to how they will actually be a part of this space, though\nthere are actually people that are working in sort of this intersection of AI agents and games. So I do expect that we’ll actually start to hear a lot of, you know, really interesting games that will sort of show in this space, right?\nMaybe just one, if it’s quick one, Audrey, maybe I can answer your question, and then we can end the session.\n56:41\n57:27\nThe hope is if the models of individuals are good enough. It will enable us to answer those questions. Right? So basically, imagine you have a policy, can you actually implement the policy in the small game world that I just showed you, and see how people might actually live under that policy. I think those are really fascinating questions. We have some ways to go before we can really be confident that this is working scientifically. But that’s the hope. That’s, I think, where this is headed.\n58:07\nOkay, sounds good. Thank you so much.\n58:09\n58:38\nThank you so much, June, for your time. It’s always a pleasure, and your talk is always really fun. So so glad everyone got to enjoy it. Thank you again for your time. Everybody say goodbye to June, and thank you.\n58:51\nSee you later. See you later. Everyone.\n58:55\nAnd students. Reflection sessions start at 2 10, so feel free to hop there, take a break, and then we’ll see you there\nbye.\n"},"03_resources/Software-Engineer's-Resume-Advice":{"title":"Software Engineer's Resume Advice","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Source: map.sistilli.dev/public/coding/Software+Engineer’s+Resume+Checklist\nGeneral things \nOverall \nMake sure there are no spelling mistakes, and keep your resume to 1 page at most. Use a commonly used font (i.e Arial), as special templates with images and unusual formats can clog up an ATS system, causing your resume not to make it past the initial screening. Try to stand out with your experience and merit—not with fancy resume formatting.\nThat being said, small errors like spelling mistakes and formatting inconsistencies are usually red flags in a candidate. If you can’t take the time to make your resume nicely organized and clean, it’s probably an indicator of how you write code as well. If you’re a non native english speaker who’s a bit worried about grammar, passing text into ChatGPT just to fix any small grammar issues is the best way to go.\n\n Are you using an easy to read font like Arial, Calibri, or Garamond?\n Are the font sizes across all sections consistent?\n\n Headers\n Bullet points\n Contact info\n Company names &amp; Locations\n Your name\n\n\n Is everything grammatically correct?\n Is it limited to 1 page? (unless you’re senior+ level, but even then 1 page is enough)\n Are you submitting as a PDF to make sure the formatting is consistent?\n\nPersonal Information \nThis is the easiest section to get right. Make sure things are neatly formatted, and PROPERLY UPDATED! The amount of times I’ve clicked on someone’s Github link to find the link’s broken or their Github isn’t updated is insane. If it’s not mandatory, and it’s not updated, don’t include it.\n\n Is all your information there and correct?\n\n Name\n LinkedIn\n Email\n Location\n\n you’d be surprised how many people leave this out\n\n\n Github (don’t add if there’s nothing there, but hopefully there is something)\n Personal site (ONLY if it’s good!! Check my site reviews and my Youtube portfolio reviews to get inspo from good portfolio sites)\n\n\n\n“Summary” or “Personal statement” \nThe goal of this is to save the other person’s time in determining if you’re a fit (and to sometime game ATS systems). Only include this section if you’ll be updating it with relevant information. Otherwise, if it’s boilerplate stuff that talks about how “passionate” you are, just leave it out.\nAn example of a good summary:\nSoftware Engineer with X years of full stack web development experience specializing in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Domain expert in e-commerce and payments field as a result of working at multiple e-commerce companies.\nor\nSenior Software Engineer @ Google with 5 years of experience leading teams\n\n Is your summary actually relevant to the job you’re applying to?\n\n Did you cut out random buzz words?\n Did you include technologies they specifically emphasized in the job application?\n\n\n Is it one/two sentences that gets straight to the point?\n If you have any outstanding notable things (i.e graduated from Harvard, worked at Google) did you mention it?\n\nExperience / Projects section \nMostly looking at this section to understand what level you’re at, how many years of experience you have, what technologies you work with on a daily basis, and if you’ve worked anywhere prestigious. If you only have projects, having the project title link to the github repo helps a lot.\n\n Is the formatting consistent?\n Is it easy to tell how long you’ve worked at places?\n Can someone looking at your resume easily figure out what technologies you’ve worked with at just a glance?\n Is there anything public the recruiter can click on and look at that you’ve built while at that company / building that project? This gets bonus points if it’s relevant to what we’re hiring for\n\nTechnologies section \nIf you’re applying for a job, and you tell me you’ve used every technology under the sun, I’m going to assume you’re a novice at all of them. Chances are I’m hiring for a specific role with specific technologies, and I’m just trying to find an expert in those things. The more you have = the more general of an engineer you’re assumed to be. The more general = the less quality for more specific jobs.\n\n Did you focus on the skills you mainly do / are specifically right for the job?\n\n Matching your skills closely with ones mentioned on the application is great for ATS bypassing as well\n\n\n Is it formatted in a nice and easy to understand way? Or did you list 25 technologies in no particular order?\n\nEducation section \nDepending on the job you’re applying for, the person looking at your resume might completely overlook your education section, or it might be vitally important. Usually the bigger and more prestigious the company, the more of an advantage a “top school” might give you. For most jobs though, it’s probably not super important.\n\n Is your GPA good? If so list it, if not, leave it out\n Do you have relevant stuff you did at school i.e attending hackathons, organizing your competitive programming club, etc? if so, mention it. Don’t mention that one time you got a 100 on your Spanish exam though.\n Don’t list common things everyone at your school has done. If everyone had to build a weather app for a class, that’s probably not a great project to showcase. You want to seem DIFFERENT and more “passionate” than everyone you’re competing against.\n\nAdvanced checklist \nAdvanced checklist (formatting etc):\nI’d recommend checking out www.faangtechleads.com/resume/checklist\nThey’re not sponsored / I don’t know them, but I used their tips when building my resume building algorithm at hyrd.dev\nUnderstand what recruiters and engineers are looking for \nThe more empathy you have for the person on the other side of the process, the more successful you’ll be able to be.\nUsually your resume is either getting looked at by a recruiter who makes the decision of whether or not to send you to an engineer, or an engineer themselves.\nRecruiters \nRecruiters will normally be looking for a few things:\n\nDo you fit the job description in terms of skills, role, and seniority?\n\nHow well do your skills match?\nAre you at the seniority level they need?\nIs your job title similar to what they’re hiring for?\nIs your specialization the same as the one they need?\n\n\nDo you fit the job in terms of technicalities\n\nWhere are you located?\nHow long have you been working professionally for?\nage\nworking hours / work style (hybrid, remote, in-office)\nvisa status\netc\n\n\nIs there anything that sets you apart from other candidates?\n\nExperience at a top company\nGraduated from a well known school\nWorked on important things in the past / contributed to major projects in some way\nOther notable or special achievements that give you a little sparkle above everyone else\n\n\n\nEngineers \nEngineers will look for:\n\nAre you a specialist or generalist?\n\nDo you list every technology under the sun? Or do you know your craft extremely well and deep? Usually no one wants to hire a generalist to do a specialist’s job.\n\n\nHow well do you know the technologies we’re hiring for?\n\nHave you dabbled with a PoC in that technology, or have you worked with it on a daily basis?\nHow closely do you align with our tech stack?\nDo you look adaptable or do you use super old technologies?\n\n\nWhat have you built?\n\nIs it similar to what we’re building?\nIs it similar to what we’re hiring you for?\nWhat parts of the process were you involved in when you built it?\n\n\nAre you a proactive and passionate coder? Or just someone who does it for a living?\n\nWhile working a job is a 9-5 thing, someone who enjoys what they do and takes personal time to experiment with new technologies and build things will always be a better engineer than someone who does it solely for money. It’s just a general trend that I think every working engineer has seen.\nUsually proactive coders will have experience with more modern technologies as well, which is helpful, and they seem more adaptable without coming off as a generalist\n\n\nHow long have you been working, and have you worked anywhere notable?\n\nSame as the recruiter above\n\n\n\nA note on ATS \nATS’s (Application Tracking Systems) are used by almost every big company that hires software engineers.\nWhen a recruiter makes a LinkedIn job posting, and they get 500 applicants within the first hour, their ATS system is what helps score, organize, and disqualify candidates who don’t match well. Usually if your resume is some funky custom template with wierd formatting, or if you don’t meet the job requirements at all, you’ll be automatically rejected (internally) almost immediately.\nAlmost all Fortune 500 companies use ATS for recruitment ²\n75% of resumes don’t reach a recruiter ¹\nATS isn’t all bad though - if you know how ATS works, you can also “game” the system to getting an interview. “Gaming” ATS is a lot like optimizing your site for Google. Obviously you probably don’t want to lie in order to do it, but it can be a good edge if you actually fit the job reqs nicely.\nGeneral ATS Tips \n\n Don’t use random fancy formatted templates - keep it standard. A good resume example is something like this\n Fonts: Stick to Arial, Calibri, Garamond\n Font size: 10px for general text - still readable, but small enough to fit lots of stuff in lmao. Ofc your headers etc will be bigger.\n Use your professional summary to specifically mention technologies that they’re looking for - that means you’ll have to modify this for every job you apply to, or use a tool like hyrd.dev to automatically use AI to do it.\n Same tip for experiences and projects - if you can highlight things they specifically mention in the JD (job description) it’ll be better.

This builds experience and helps avoid burnout. \nSet Deadlines: Strict deadlines help prevent scope creep and teach you to finish projects. \nCollaborate: Working with others is usually better than going completely solo, as game development is a huge undertaking. \nBuild Connections: Network with peers and be a pleasant collaborator; people prefer working with those they get along with. \n\nMaking the Game\n\nFocus on the Core Gameplay Loop: Make sure the main activity in your game is fun, as this is what players will do most. \nSound is Crucial: Add sound effects early; they are fundamental to how a game feels. \nExpect Delays: Everything takes longer than you think—plan for this. \n“Good Enough” is Often Enough: Don’t get stuck perfecting things; finishing is more important. \nBack Up Your Work: Use version control (like Git) or at least regular backups. \nAvoid Multiplayer (Unless Experienced): Multiplayer adds significant complexity and is not recommended for beginners. \n\nGame Design Advice\n\n“Close Enough” is Enough: Be generous with things like hitboxes; players blame the game if they “almost” succeed. \nMemorable Levels: Each level should have at least one memorable feature. \nExaggerate Audio for Impact: Make sounds feel impactful, not just realistic. \nGuide, Don’t Force: Encourage fun playstyles but allow player expression. \nMultiple Solutions: Give players more than one way to solve problems. \nFrame Challenges as Opportunities: Present mechanics as giving opportunities, not taking them away. \nResponsive Controls: Player input should be responded to instantly for a satisfying feel. \nUse Calm to Make Intensity Stand Out: Alternate intense and calm moments for better pacing. \n\nWriting &amp; Music\n\nStrong Beginnings and Endings: These are the most important parts of a story. \nLeave Some Questions Unanswered: Ambiguity can make stories more interesting. \nCut Unnecessary Content: Shorter, more focused writing is usually better. \nMusic Should Avoid Excessive Repetition: Since game music loops, avoid repetitive motifs. \nGet Weird with Soundtracks: Games allow for more experimental music than other media. \n\nIteration &amp; Feedback\n\nPlaytest Constantly: Regularly play your own game to spot issues. \nLearn to Take Feedback: Filter suggestions through your vision, but don’t ignore them. \nStudy Good and Bad Games: Learn from both successes and failures, even outside your genre. \nNo Universal Rules: Every design decision is context-dependent. \n\nMarketing &amp; Releasing\n\nStart Marketing Early: Build an audience from the beginning, using platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Discord. \nDemos Are Powerful: A good demo can drive word of mouth and sales. \nTarget the Right Influencers: Focus on streamers/YouTubers with audiences interested in your genre. \nSet Up a Steam Page Early: Start collecting wishlists as soon as your game looks presentable. \nFoster a Healthy Community: Early, welcoming communities help your game grow. \nDon’t Badmouth Others Publicly: It can hurt your reputation and opportunities. \n\nFinishing &amp; Beyond\n\nFinishing is Hard: The last 10% of development is the toughest. \nPolish and Consistency: Do a final pass to ensure the game feels cohesive. \nEarly Access Can Help: It provides feedback and financial support for small teams. \nUnderstand Taxes: Be prepared for the business side of releasing a commercial game. \n\nThese points summarize the practical, experience-based advice Hakita offers to indie game developers throughout the video."},"03_resources/Starting-on-the-Right-Foot-with-Reinforcement-Learning":{"title":"Starting on the Right Foot with Reinforcement Learning","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nBoston Dynamics has integrated reinforcement learning (RL) into Spot’s locomotion control system to enhance its ability to navigate diverse and challenging real-world environments. This hybrid approach, combining RL with existing Model Predictive Control (MPC), addresses limitations of the previous system by reducing computational load and making the robot more robust against falls on irregular or slick surfaces. The RL policy is trained through millions of simulations and rigorously tested on an internal fleet of robots before deployment. The company plans to continue expanding RL’s role in robot development and has released a Spot RL Researcher Kit for external developers.\nKey Points\n\nProblem with Prior System (MPC): Struggled with unobservable/unmodellable real-world conditions, consumed significant compute, and was difficult to adapt.\nSolution: Hybrid RL Integration: Combined reinforcement learning with existing model-based control to focus learning on challenging aspects and reduce computational complexity.\nRL Training Process: Policy (neural network) optimized through trial and error in over a million simulations, varying physical properties and maximizing performance objectives.\nRigorous Evaluation: Benchmarked in parallel simulations and deployed to a 24/7 internal Spot fleet for thousands of hours across diverse terrains.\nKey Results: Significantly reduced falls on slick/irregular surfaces, improved reliability, and enabled deployment in previously challenging areas for customers.\nFuture Outlook: Exploring new architectures for advanced capabilities (e.g., climbing high obstacles) and offering a Spot RL Researcher Kit for external development of advanced robot skills.\n\n\nbostondynamics.com/blog/starting-on-the-right-foot-with-reinforcement-learning/\nOriginal Content\nInnovation\nBlogs •\nIn order to design control software that can be extended over time to handle more and more real-world viability, we’ve integrated reinforcement learning into Spot’s locomotion control system.\n\nSpot’s legged mobility enables it to bring advanced sensing and manipulation capabilities across a wide range of structured and unstructured environments. In our customer’s hands, Spot performs multi-floor factory inspections, overcomes dust and debris during nuclear plant decommissioning, and navigates frozen arctic pit mines, among many other applications. Spot robots deployed across the world have cumulatively walked over 250,000km and continue operations day and night at a current rate of nearly the circumference of Earth every three months.\nBut how does Spot’s walking control system actually work? The legged robots we’ve built at Boston Dynamics have historically leveraged Model Predictive Control (MPC), a control strategy that predicts and optimizes the future states of the robot in order to decide what action to take in the moment. These strategies work well when the controller’s model behaves similarly to the physical system and when the robot’s state, environment, and goals can be well represented as objectives and constraints in an optimization problem. These systems are typically intuitive, debuggable, and they allow us to tune robot behaviors to achieve both practical and aesthetic goals.\nHowever in real-world conditions, there are situations that can be difficult to observe and accurately model. For example, to perform routine inspections in one customer facility, Spot has to traverse over the edge of a container used for liquid containment. Here, the robot must move over the obstacle without tripping or slipping on the potentially wet or greasy floor. There are many other examples like this, where the particular arrangements and conditions of real-world environments stresses the robot’s control system. This raises the question: how do we design control software that can be extended over time to handle more and more of these cases while not degrading performance in all other situations?\nLocomotion Control on Spot\nControl systems for legged robots make decisions at multiple time scales. They decide what path the robot should take, what pattern of steps it should use to move along that path, and how to make high speed adjustments to posture and step timing in order to maintain balance. For example, carefully sequencing steps on stairs allows the robot to execute smooth motion while maintaining a sufficient margin from the stair edges to recover from uncertainty. Or when the robot slips, fast step recovery motions are critical to returning to stable locomotion.\nSpot’s production controller achieves this multi-scale decision making by evaluating many MPC controllers simultaneously. In less than a millisecond, Spot evaluates dozens of individual predictive horizons, each with its own unique step trajectory reference that considers both the robot and environment state (e.g., terrain roughness, presence of obstacles). To choose from among these many solutions, we’ve developed a system that can “score” the output of each of these controllers, selecting the one with the maximum value and using its output to control the robot.\n\nLegacy locomotion control system\nThis approach has yielded a mean time between falls of hundreds of hours, but it has a couple drawbacks. First, having to evaluate multiple MPC instances in parallel consumes significant onboard compute, which takes additional time and energy. Second, making changes to the selection function in order to address new failure modes can be nontrivial and risks inadvertently reducing performance in other situations. To address both of these challenges, we recently employed a data-driven approach to robot control design called reinforcement learning.\nReinforcement Learning for Locomotion\nTraditional approaches to creating robot controllers require engineers to think carefully about the problem they want to solve, devise a detailed strategy for the robot to solve the problem in source code (e.g., C++), then run the compiled code on the robot to measure performance. The primary challenge with this approach is that the human programmers have to come up with the strategy to solve the problem, which can be hard to do for complex problems (like walking reliably all over the world).\nReinforcement learning (RL) is an alternative approach to programming robots that instead optimizes the strategy (i.e. the controller or policy) through trial and error experience in a simulator. In this setting, the policy is no longer written in human-readable source code, it is instead implemented in a neural network whose parameters are optimized by the RL algorithm. This changes the process of programming controllers significantly because engineers need only be able to simulate scenarios of interest and define a performance objective to be optimized (called a reward function). This approach can be advantageous in situations where the problem conditions are easy to simulate, but good strategies are difficult to describe. For example, the below image illustrates simulation scenarios we can programmatically generate to capture a wide range of locomotion situations Spot robots experience on a daily basis.\n\nSample scenarios experience in simulation during training\nTo apply RL to Spot’s locomotion control stack, we defined the inputs and outputs of the policy in the following way:\n\nLocomotion control system with integrated RL policy\nArchitecting things this way has multiple benefits. First, it allows us to take advantage of our existing model-based locomotion controller to solve the part of the problem it handles well, while focusing learning on the part of the strategy that is harder to program. Second, it reduces the computational complexity of the production controller by removing the need to run multiple MPC instances in parallel.\nWe train the policy by running over a million simulations on a compute cluster and using the data from those simulations to update the policy parameters. Simulation environments are generated randomly with varying physical properties (e.g., stair dimensions, terrain roughness, ground friction) and the objective maximized by the RL algorithm includes different terms that reflect the robot’s ability to follow navigation commands while not falling or bumping its body into parts of the environment. The result of this process is a policy that works better on average across the distribution of simulation environments it experiences during learning, but how do we know if the policy will lead to an improvement on the real robot fleet?\nEvaluating Learned Policies with Robustness Testing\nWe learned years ago that in order to be confident in robot software changes, it is important to be able to do testing at a representative scale. We achieve this through a combination of simulation and hardware testing to evaluate all software changes before they are shipped to customers. We applied the same process to evaluating learned locomotion policies.\nWe used many parallel simulations to benchmark the robot performance on a set of scenarios with increasing difficulty. For example, decrease the coefficient of friction to characterize the slipperiest environment that can be reliably traversed. We collected statistics to validate that the learned policies improved performance in specific scenarios while maintaining performance in hundreds of others where the current production system already performs well.\nOnce simulation results met our standards, we deployed the policy to our internal robustness fleet of Spot robots. These robots operate 24/7 for a cumulative runtime of over 2,000 hours a week indoors, outdoors, on various stairs, floor materials, and simulated weather conditions. We leverage systems that track performance metrics of this fleet in a digital dashboard and upload logs for engineers to review.\nTo robustify our learned policy given the data we collect, falls and general mobility issues that are reproducible within a physics simulation are recreated in simulation where they become either part of the training or evaluation set. Retraining a policy then effectively robustifies to failure modes we’ve already seen.\nAfter thousands of hours of simulated and on-robot runtime across varied configurations and terrains is the policy ready for deployment to customer robots.\nResults with RL\nIn both our reliability fleet and in customer fleets, we have seen the benefits of these upgrades. Spot is now less likely to fall—even on extremely slick or irregular surfaces. This improved locomotion means customers can more easily deploy Spot in areas of their facilities that would have otherwise been challenging to access, as well as receive additional downstream benefits from improved reliability. For example, reducing the likelihood of falls also reduces the likelihood of operator interventions or damage resulting from a fall.\nCurrent Spot users will automatically benefit from the performance improvements of this RL policy following our most recent software update. And we’re continuing to iterate with the data we’re collecting to further refine the policy and expand the capabilities.\nBefore and after performance using Spot Version 4.0\nWhat’s Next?\nWhile a hybrid control strategy that leverages both a model predictive controller and a learned policy is proving effective at expanding and robustifying robotic capabilities, it largely imposes the limitations of the modeling on the full control system. To unlock totally new capabilities or be tolerant in scenarios that excessively violate the assumptions of the models, we are actively exploring and testing totally different architectures.\nA learned policy in combination with a model-based controller that is not limited to the periodic gait assumptions of the stepping controllers is capable of climbing boxes &gt;70cm in height\nIn addition to our own R&amp;D initiatives, we are also excited to enable the broader robotics research community. RL in the real world requires three essential components: robot hardware with joint level controls, a high-performance AI computer, and a simulator where the robot can be trained. At NVIDIA GTC, we announced our new Spot RL Researcher Kit in collaboration with NVIDIA and the AI Institute to provide these components in a single package. The kit includes a license for joint level control API, a payload based on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for deploying the RL policy, and a GPU accelerated Spot simulation environment based on NVIDIA Isaac Lab.\nThe new research kit enables developers to create advanced skills for Spot. For example, the AI Institute, our first customer using these tools, developed new gaits for Spot that allow the robot to walk much faster than the standard version. Interested developers can contact us to get started with the Spot RL Researcher Kit.\nAs our robots continue to expand into new environments and perform more types of work, we expect that machine learning will play an increasing role in our robot behavior development and we will continue to build on the processes, experience, and unique data we generate to make our robots go further and do more.\nRecent Blogs\nSubscribe for More Insights\nFeatured Resources\nView All Resources\nInnovation\nVideo\n• 5 min watch\nReinforcement Learning with Spot\nInnovation\nBlog\n• 11 min read\nRobots That Can Chat\nInnovation\nCase Study\n• 7 min read\nMeta: Advanced AI Research"},"03_resources/The-Data-Science-Resume-That-Got-Me-Jobs--and--Interviews":{"title":"The Data Science Resume That Got Me Jobs & Interviews","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThis article provides a detailed guide on structuring a data science resume based on the author’s successful experience.

By author.\nI have anonymised certain parts for privacy reasons, but this is literally the resume structure and language I used when applying for data science roles.\nIf you want to get this PDF template, then check out the link below!\n\nWelcome to ‘Dishing the Data’\n\nLet’s now break down each section along with top tips!\n\nIf you want this template, this resume is built from Overleaf using a template created by Timmy Chan. Chan is credited with the template; you can check the source code here on his GitHub. The template and code are under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 licence.\n\nDesign &amp; Layout\nFirst, your Resume/CV should be one page long. On average, a recruiter will look at it for 6–8 seconds, so make their lives easier by making it one page to avoid unnecessary scrolling.\nSecondly, I recommend you write your resume using LaTeX, a software for typesetting documents. I think LaTeX looks much nicer than Word or Google Docs; it is way more flexible and customisable, and as data science is an industry with many academics, they will appreciate the effort in writing your Resume in LaTeX.\nLaTeX is also a great skill to have, regardless of whether you are creating a resume. I use it every time I write a blog post to produce mathematical equations, when creating invoices for side projects, or when writing one pagers in my job.\nI recommend getting started using Overleaf, which is completely free and contains many resume template s and much more. That’s where I found Timmy Chan ‘s template for my resume!\nThere is a slight learning curve, but it will only take you a couple of days to become proficient, it’s pretty intuitive, especially for some small projects like a resume. I recommend starting with the Overleaf tutorials and working your way through those.\nOf course, if you ever get stuck, ChatGPT can quickly help you overcome any problems you may have.\nFinally, keep it clean and simple. Avoid using lots of small text; make it as easy to read as possible with consistent formatting throughout. Simple and elegant is always the best approach for a resume.\nHeader\n\nHeader section from my resume.\nThis part is straightforward; the header should include your contact details and any useful links to demonstrate your work, experience and external projects.\nI recommend adding links to your website or projects to showcase your interest in the field right from the start. These links likely contain more information about you than the resume itself, so you ideally want recruiters and interviewers to look at them to learn more about you.\nThese external links will also give you something interesting to discuss with the interviewer later if they find something interesting in your past work.\nSome people often add an “About” or “Summary” section here. These are a bit redundant and just waste space in my opinion. If I am applying for a data science role, it’s obvious, given my background and experience, that I am a data scientist with specific skills. I don’t need to write it out explicitly.\nUnless you are changing careers, maybe that’s when an “About” or “Summary” section could be helpful, but otherwise, it’s probably unneeded. However, I am sure some people will disagree with me on this!\nTechnical Skills\n\nSkills section from my resume.\nThe next important thing is listing your technical skills. This is like a very, very short version of all your abilities.\nThis is high on the resume because it will immediately help the recruiter know if you meet the job’s technical requirements. It is almost like a checklist that is over and done with early on and should increase your chances of getting through to an interview.\nA few things I recommend you do in this section are:\n\nDon’t list too many things; this looks suspicious. I would be sceptical if you listed something like “Python, SQL, C++, Rust, R, Assembly.” It seems like a bunch of buzzwords, and I would find it highly unlikely you knew them all to a reasonable level.\nWhen it comes to coding abilities, it’s best to use language like “proficient” or “familiar with.” Avoid using arbitrary star ratings like “Python 4/5” or claiming to be “advanced.” This way, you’re setting realistic expectations and ensuring that your skills are accurately represented.\nDon’t write out every Python package you know. I see this a lot, but it is really unneeded. If you are applying for a data science position, I already presume you know numpy, pandas, and matplotlib; there is no need to explicitly state it!\nMost importantly, don’t lie. It’s a known fact that people exaggerate in their resumes, but you don’t want to list any skills that you can’t back up without evidence.\n\nExperience/Projects\n\nExperience section from my resume.\nNext up is experience or projects if you haven’t worked any relevant jobs for being a data scientist yet.\nThe most important part here is to demonstrate exactly what you have done at each company and what the outcome was, ideally using numbers and figures where possible.\nDon’t try to be too humble; really “flex” the work you have done and the impact you have produced. Again, obviously, don’t outright lie, but make sure to showcase how great you are.\nFor example, notice here how I discuss technical steps like “ARIMAX” or “XGBoost” with the goal of better forecasting or predicting something and finally state the financial value or metric improvement.\nThis shows my technical abilities and that I think of business impact with my projects, which are crucial skills for any data scientist.\nFeel free to mention other softer skills as well. I discuss working in a cross-functional team and leading sessions like a data science journal club. However, the technical deliverables should take precedence, particularly for junior roles.\nIf you haven’t got any experience, replace this with a projects section and carry out similar wording regarding the technical and business parts. Try to list projects most relevant to the role you are applying for to demonstrate an interest in that particular area.\nEducation\n\nEducation section from my resume.\nNow we are onto education. If you don’t have any relevant work experience, I recommend putting the education section before work experience and then a projects section after.\nAs I have a few years of experience as a data scientist, my education section is pretty simple. I keep it in as many data science job adverts explicitly state a need for a master’s degree in a STEM subject. So, I have mine to fill that check box right off the bat.\nHowever, if you don’t have experience, you should flesh this education section out and discuss any relevant work you have done in your degree for a data science job.\nThis is especially true if you have done a data science or machine learning master’s. You probably have loads of relevant coursework that you can mention here to showcase your knowledge. Try to make the wording of these projects similar to that of the experience section above.\nIf you have a science or maths degree, you might have done a coding or statistical analysis project. Again, this is very relevant to a data science position, and you should definitely include this.\nPersonal Interests / Activities\n\nActivities section from my resume.\nTo ensure you are a normal human outside of work, I’d always add some personal interests at the bottom. It may even lead to an exciting talking point with an interviewer, which is always a good thing!\nI say this, but two of my activities mentioned are my blog here on Medium and my YouTube channel! I include these as they are unique and would make me stand out and demonstrate my interest in the field.\nI do mention that I play hockey, so I am not purely some data science robot! And, you never know, maybe my interviewer or recruiter also plays hockey!\nTwo or three bullet points are enough in this part and try to add things that you feel make you unique and stand out compared to other candidates.\nSummary\nTo summarise the key points:\n\nMake it one page; recruiters don’t have time to read multiple pages.\nMake it in LaTeX using one of the templates from Overleaf; I prefer the look of LaTeX to Word or Google Docs.\nAdd a skills section at the top listing all your relevant technical abilities.\nUse numbers and figures in the experience section to concretely demonstrate your impact.\nAdd any relevant projects if you lack relevant experience, and explain them.\nAdd in your degree, particularly if it is a STEM subject, as many data science jobs list this as a requirement.\nHobbies and activities are helpful to show you are not a robot and demonstrate your uniqueness.\n\nAnother Thing!\nI have a free newsletter, Dishing the Data, where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist.

It means “generating code with AI without caring about the code that is produced”. See Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding for my previous writing on this subject. This is a hill I am willing to die on. I fear it will be the death of me.\nI just learned about not one but two forthcoming books that use vibe coding in the title and abuse that very clear definition!\nVibe Coding by Gene Kim and Steve Yegge (published by IT Revolution) carries the subtitle “Building Production-Grade Software With GenAI, Chat, Agents, and Beyond”—exactly what vibe coding is not.\nVibe Coding: The Future of Programming by Addie Osmani (published by O’Reilly Media) likewise talks about how professional engineers can integrate AI-assisted coding tools into their workflow.\nI fear it may be too late for these authors and publishers to fix their embarrassing mistakes: they’ve already designed the cover art!\n\nI wonder if this a new record for the time from a term being coined to the first published books that use that term entirely incorrectly.\nVibe coding was only coined by Andrej Karpathy on February 6th, 84 days ago. I will once again quote Andrej’s tweet, with my own highlights for emphasis:\n\nThere’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.\nI ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.\nIt’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.\n\nAndrej could not have stated this more clearly: vibe coding is when you forget that the code even exists, as a fun way to build throwaway projects. It’s not the same thing as using LLM tools as part of your process for responsibly building production code.\nI know it’s harder now that tweets are longer than 480 characters, but it’s vitally important you read to the end of the tweet before publishing a book about something!\nNow what do we call books on about real vibe coding?\nThis is the aspect of this whole thing that most disappoints me.\nI think there is a real need for a book on actual vibe coding: helping people who are not software developers—and who don’t want to become developers—learn how to use vibe coding techniques safely, effectively and responsibly to solve their problems.\nThis is a rich, deep topic! Most of the population of the world are never going to learn to code, but thanks to vibe coding tools those people now have a path to building custom software.\nEveryone deserves the right to automate tedious things in their lives with a computer. They shouldn’t have to learn programming in order to do that. That is who vibe coding is for. It’s not for people who are software engineers already!\nThere are so many questions to be answered here. What kind of projects can be built in this way? How can you avoid the traps around security, privacy, reliability and a risk of over-spending? How can you navigate the jagged frontier of things that can be achieved in this way versus things that are completely impossible?\nA book for people like that could be a genuine bestseller! But because three authors and the staff of two publishers didn’t read to the end of the tweet we now need to find a new buzzy term for that, despite having the perfect term for it already.\nI’m fully aware that I’ve lost at this point— Semantic Diffusion is an unstoppable force. What next?

Over 90% of all data in the world was created in the last two years. If you burned all the data generated in a day onto CDs, that stack could reach the mean twice. Data is big and valuable – so knowing how to operate on it is crucial. To do so, it is crucial to learn about the different types of data and what they represent. Let’s get started!\nQualitative vs Quantitative\nNow, you have probably gone over this several times throughout your life, so I will keep this short. Qualitative data (also known as categorical data) is data that cannot be measured using numbers. When sorting categorical data, one can only group them into categories. Common examples of categorical data are sex (male/female), race, and educational level.\nQuantitative data is exactly what you might guess – quantifiable (numerical) data. Quantitative data can be sorted (think greatest to lowest), graphed, and used in mathematical analyses. Some common examples of quantitative data are time, weight, temperature, and grade level.\nWe can treat these two types of data, qualitative and quantitative data, as the root of the other four data types we will be exploring.\nTypes of Qualitative Data\nNominal Data\nNominal data is a type of categorical data in which each data variable cannot be compared to one another. While each variable is different from the other, they are not relatively different from each other. For instance, eye color is an example of nominal data. While several types of eye color exist (black, brown, green, blue), we cannot say that they are different in relation to each other – they are simply labels describing an attribute. The meaning of the aforementioned list of eye colors would not change if we were to change its order.\nOrdinal Data\nOrdinal data is data where each data variable is naturally related to the other. Each one is relatively different from the other, whether it be in terms of size, length, duration, etc. For example, education level (in this case college degrees) is a type of ordinal data. We can say that associate, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees are all relatively different from one another because each requires a different about of time. Theoretically, we could quantify ordinal data (associate=2 years, bachelor’s=4 years, etc) and perform mathematical operations on it, so it is sometimes considered to be in a gray area between qualitative and quantitative data.\nWhile ordinal data is also simply labels, the background information behind the labels can be compared to each other. As a result, if we were to reverse the order of the aforementioned list of college degrees, its order would change from least time → most time to most time → least time.\nTypes of Quantitative Data\nDiscrete Data\nYou have probably heard about discrete data during your middle and high school math classes. Chances are, you visualize discrete data through a graph like this:\n\nImage by the author.\nData that only involves integers that are discrete (or separate) from one another. For example, the number of people in a room is an example of discrete data. It can only be measured in whole numbers – after all, you cannot have a fraction of a person! Discrete values can be counted because there is an exact set of them, but they cannot be measured.\nContinuous Data\nContinuous data is data that involves fractions, or non-whole numbers. You most likely visualize it through a line:\n\nImage by the author.\nContinuous data consists of values such as time, height, and the price of an item. Each value can get divided or become smaller and still remain valid. For example, we can divide the time a person took to complete a race by two and it still will remain valid – even if the number goes into milliseconds and microseconds. On the other hand, we cannot always divide the number of people in a room by two. Again, you cannot have a fraction of a person! You can measure any continuous value, but you cannot count it (there are infinitely many points to count).\nConclusion\n\nImage by the author.\nWhile these 4 data types mentioned in this article do form the backbone of statistical data types, several more subtypes exist under the ones already mentioned. If you want to read more, I highly recommend this article by Niklas Donges which goes more into depth.\n\nThank you for reading! I hope you thoroughly enjoyed the article and now are more comfortable with statistical data types.\n\nTopics:\nRelated Articles\n\n\nStep-by-step code guide to building a Convolutional Neural Network\n\nPhoto by Krista Mangulsone on Unsplash\nA beginner’s guide to forecast reconciliation\n\nPhoto by davisuko on Unsplash\nHere’s how to use Autoencoders to detect signals with anomalies in a few lines of…\n\nImage from Canva.\nFeature engineering, structuring unstructured data, and lead scoring\nSolving the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) with D-Wave’s hybrid constrained quadratic model (CQM)\n\nAn illustrated guide on essential machine learning concepts\n\nDerivation and practical examples of this powerful concept\n"},"03_resources/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Students with high academic self-efficacy behave differently from those with low self-efficacy.\n\n\nUse others expectations to empower you\n\nRecall someone who believes in you\nInternalize their expectations\nStudy as if you are proving them right\n\n\nReframe your identity\n\nChoose your identity\nAct in alignment\nReinforce it, that is you\n\n\nThis is a fascinating and surprisingly common situation. It’s a sign of high self-awareness that you’ve recognized this disconnect between your external results (the 90+ scores) and your internal experience (feeling like you’re not putting in the effort).\nWhat you’re describing is a specific and often misunderstood form of low self-efficacy. Let’s call it the “High-Achiever, Low-Efficacy Paradox.”\nYour self-efficacy isn’t low for the tasks you’re currently doing. Clearly, you have high self-efficacy for getting a 90+ on your current schoolwork. The problem lies in your self-efficacy for tackling tasks where success isn’t guaranteed.\nHere’s a breakdown of what might be happening and, more importantly, what you can do to reach your full potential.\nWhy This Happens: The “Coasting” Trap\n\nYou Haven’t Needed to Build Resilience: Because schoolwork has likely come relatively easily to you, you haven’t had many opportunities for “mastery experiences” that involve genuine struggle. Your belief is “I am capable of doing things that are easy for me.” You haven’t yet built the equally important belief: “I am capable of overcoming things that are hard for me.”\nFear of Failure / Protecting Your Identity: Right now, your identity might be tied to being “the person who gets 90+ without trying.” This is a very safe place to be. If you don’t try hard, you can always tell yourself, “Well, if I had really studied, I could have gotten a 98.” If you give 100% effort and still only get a 92, it can feel like a threat to your identity as an “effortlessly smart” person. Avoiding effort is a defense mechanism.\nMisattributing Success: You might be attributing your success solely to innate ability (a fixed mindset) rather than to your strategies and effort (a growth mindset). When you believe success comes from just “being smart,” any task that requires effort feels like evidence that you might not be so smart after all.\n\nHow to Reach Your Potential: Strategies for Growth\nYour goal is to intentionally move out of your comfort zone to build a more robust and authentic kind of self-efficacy. The key is to shift your focus from protecting your score to pursuing a challenge.\n1. Intentionally Seek “Productive Struggle”\nThis is the most important step. You need to find challenges that force you to work, and then you need to succeed at them. This is how you get a true mastery experience.\n\nTake the Harder Path: If there’s an option between a standard class and an Honors/AP/IB version, take the harder one. If you have a choice of essay prompts, pick the one that seems most complex and interesting, not the easiest.\nStart a “Passion Project”: Pursue something outside of school that you’re not immediately good at. Learn a complex piece of music, code a small application, try to write a short story. The goal is to experience the cycle of being bad at something → putting in work → getting better.\nFront-Load Your Learning: Don’t wait for the teacher to assign the next chapter. Read it ahead of time. Try the hardest problems in the back of the book. You will likely struggle and get some wrong. This is the entire point. Then, when the topic is taught in class, you will have a much deeper understanding.\n\n2. Reframe Your Internal Monologue (Mindset Shift)\nYou need to change the story you tell yourself about effort and success. This is about using social persuasion on yourself.\n\nFrom: “If I have to try hard, it means I’m not smart enough.”\nTo: “This task is challenging, which means I’m giving my brain a real workout and getting smarter.”\nFrom: “I got a 95 because I’m a natural at this.”\nTo: “I got a 95 because I used a really effective study strategy and managed my time well.”\n\nAttribute your successes to your actions and strategies, not just your innate talent. This gives you control. You can always change your actions; you can’t change your innate talent.\n3. Redefine “Potential”\nStop thinking of potential as a fixed ceiling. Think of it as a horizon you are constantly moving toward. Effort is not the enemy of potential; it is the vehicle that gets you there.\nThink of a world-class athlete. They have immense natural talent, but they are also the ones who practice the most. They don’t see effort as a sign of weakness; they see it as the only way to unlock their talent. You are that athlete. Your 90+ scores show you have the talent. Now it’s time to start training like a pro.\n4. Find New Models (Vicarious Experience)\nLook at the people you truly admire—scientists, artists, entrepreneurs. Listen to their interviews or read their biographies. You will never hear them say, “It was easy.” You will hear them talk endlessly about their process, their struggles, their failures, and the immense effort they put in. This normalizes the role of hard work in high-level success.\n\nYour First Step\nPick one small, concrete thing to do this week.\n\nDon’t just do the assigned homework; try the three “challenge” problems at the end of the chapter.\nSpend 30 minutes reading ahead in your science textbook.\nWhen you get a good grade back, write down two specific things you did (actions you took) that led to that success.\n\nYou are in an excellent position. You have the intellectual horsepower. Now, you’re learning how to build the engine of resilience and effort that will let you use that horsepower to go anywhere you want. The goal is to move from being a person who gets high scores to being a person who isn’t afraid to tackle the problems that are truly hard.\nbias\n\nmodel\ngood but with bias\nor bad with no bias\ndo good with bias and try to correct bias with training data\nsupervised fastest"},"03_resources/Use-of-generative-AI-tools-to-support-learning--University-of-Oxford":{"title":"Use of generative AI tools to support learning | University of Oxford","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe University of Oxford provides guidance on the ethical and effective use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) to support student learning.

He then transitioned to supervised machine learning, defining its core concepts, distinguishing it from unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and discussing its applications in classification and regression. The lecture provided practical demonstrations using Python’s scikit-learn library, covering algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Regression (including polynomial), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels, and Random Forests. Shlomo emphasized data visualization, model evaluation through metrics like classification reports and confusion matrices, and parameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search). Real-world examples like face recognition and digit classification were used to illustrate these concepts. The lecture concluded by assigning homework related to probability simulations and applying the discussed classification algorithms to external datasets.\nKey Points\n\nBayesian vs. Classical Statistics:\n\nClassical probability: limiting relative frequency.\nBayesian probability: degree of belief, updated with data.\nBayesian inference uses prior distribution and likelihood to derive a posterior distribution for estimation.\n\n\nMachine Learning Fundamentals:\n\nDefinition: Computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience (more data).\nSupervised Learning: Computer is presented with labeled examples (e.g., dog/cat images with labels) to learn a general mapping rule.\nUnsupervised Learning: Computer finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).\nReinforcement Learning: Agent learns to perform in an environment (not covered in depth).\nML objectives: Classify data and make predictions.\nConnection to Optimization: ML tasks often formulated as minimizing a loss function.\n\n\nPython and Scikit-learn:\n\npip install scikit-learn for ML algorithms.\nseaborn for visualization.\nScikit-learn provides datasets (e.g., Iris, Digits, LFW Faces) and algorithms.\nGeneral workflow: model = AlgoType(), model.fit(data, labels), model.predict(newData).\n\n\nSupervised Learning Algorithms Demonstrated:\n\nGaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes data for each class comes from a simple Gaussian distribution; fast and simple, suitable for high-dimensional data.\nLinear Regression: Fits a straight line to data points; extendable to polynomial regression (basis functions).\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the hyperplane with the maximum margin between classes.\n\nSVC (Support Vector Classifier) with linear or rbf (radial basis function) kernels.\nParameters C and gamma for tuning.\n\n\nRandom Forest: An ensemble of randomized decision trees.\n\nFast training and prediction, can be parallelized.\nProvides probabilistic classification based on multiple trees’ votes.\n\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation:\n\nTrain-Test Split: Divide data into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization performance.\nGrid Search: Optimize algorithm parameters by testing combinations over a defined grid.\nClassification Report: Shows precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.\nConfusion Matrix: Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions for each class, highlighting specific error types.\n\n\nHomework Assignments:\n\nSimulate the Birthday Problem and Central Limit Theorem (from previous lecture).\nApply Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest on a Kaggle dataset, showing error metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy.\n\n\n\nShlomo continued his lecture on statistics, focusing on the Bayesian method and contrasting it with the classical approach. He explained that Bayesian probability represents a degree of belief rather than a limiting frequency, and demonstrated how to construct a posterior distribution by updating a prior distribution with observed data. Shlomo showed that Bayesian point estimation involves finding the mean of the posterior distribution, and interval estimation can be achieved by determining the values that capture the desired probability mass. He concluded by illustrating how to calculate confidence intervals using a normal distribution transformation, noting that the results align with those from the classical approach.\nShlomo introduces the Gaussian naive Bayes classification method and demonstrates its implementation using Python. He explains that this method assumes data for each label comes from a simple Gaussian distribution with no covariance between dimensions. Shlomo shows how to create and visualize sample data using the make_blobs function, controlling parameters like standard deviation to illustrate how the algorithm performs under different conditions. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the data and its visualization before applying machine learning algorithms.\nShlomo demonstrated several machine learning algorithms, starting with a Gaussian clustering example that showed how clusters can overlap when their standard deviations increase. He then explained linear regression by creating a simple code that fits a line to random points, and finally demonstrated polynomial regression by showing how increasing the degree of the polynomial can improve the fit to non-linear data. Throughout the presentation, Shlomo emphasized the common structure of machine learning models, which typically involve defining the model type, fitting the model to data, and using the model to make predictions.\nShlomo demonstrated the use of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for separating two classes of data, adjusting the noise level to create easier or harder classification problems. He emphasized the simplicity and effectiveness of SVM for projects and recommended it as a method for the course’s final presentation. Shlomo also introduced the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data, such as images, to make classification more manageable. He explained the use of pipelines to combine PCA and SVM for face recognition and planned to cover PCA’s implementation and details in the next session.\nShlomo presented on machine learning algorithms, focusing on PCA for dimensionality reduction and random forests for classification. He demonstrated how reducing dimensions from 150 to 25 affected model accuracy, noting that more errors occurred with fewer dimensions. Shlomo then introduced random forests, explaining how they use multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and provide probabilistic results. He ran experiments on the digits dataset, showing how accuracy improved from 69% with a single decision tree to 98% with 500 trees. Shlomo assigned two homework tasks: one involving Gaussian SVM and random forest classification on a chosen Kaggle dataset, due the following Saturday, and another simulating the birthday problem and Central Limit Theorem from the previous lecture.\n\nzoom.us/rec/play/qumuRWBhbSYp8S_3ewfuK2SbDznZ1fvhvdJ_oFW_-k6znMto2TCa3743d-grKwmH2GBVXOCwcjIOxnI4.mnNJHHGteiEEXWh5%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FERtudH2ZrlQV0DiupTTzozKXQKchuo2lPSEhe8r6YfV41A5eOv_RYMoXCoLq-H95.eZqFxOAdgyhpCKHQ\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 01:38:07\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:06:38\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\n00:06:54\nYes!\n00:06:55\nOkay, thanks.\nOkay, Hi, everyone. And welcome to our second lecture from data, science and application.\nLast time, I think, I stopped about here\ntalking about the birthday problem and the\ncentral limit theorem. I will give you this as homework for\ndoing next time or next week.\nAnd again you can discuss these homework with the Ta. To make sure you understand everything, and you know what to do.\nI would like to go and talk about specific thing in statistics.\nAnd I would just say that in general we have\nin statistics we understand population from analyzing a sample which is much smaller. This is the essence of everything.\nSometimes we need to estimate a single parameter.\nlike average height or temperature, or whatever it is.\nSometimes we want a confidence set that is an interval that captures\nmost of the data. Okay? And what I’d like to do now is to go and discuss\nspecific thing in statistic, which is called the Bayesian method, because we’re gonna be doing Bayesian estimation\nBayesian method for some stuff we will see in a moment.\nand I would like to contrast the Bayesian method with the classical approach.\nSo when I talked about probability last time, I interpret, probability is having to do with frequency how likely the event is.\nand so on.\nSo probability refers to a limiting relative frequency.\nand when we do statistical procedure, we would like them to have\nlong run frequency property. For example.\na 95% confidence interval should trap the true value of the parameter\nwith a limiting frequency of at least 95%.\nBayesian approach is different probability.\nIt’s really a degree of belief, not a limiting frequency.\nAnd in the next couple of slides I would like to show you the essence of what happens with the Bayesian approach.\nhow we work with it, although practically it gives the same result as the frequencies approach\npeople. You know, I know a lot of people who prefer to think about things using the Bayesian approach.\nWhat we do in Bayesian approach we make inference\nby 1st constructing a probability distribution for whatever we are doing. Okay. So we will do it with some example. And you will see\nthis page summarizes the essence of the method.\nWe begin by choosing a probability density. This is our choice. Okay, you do whatever you want here.\nUniform distribution. Gaussian, whichever you want to do this is prior called a prior distribution.\nIt reflects your belief about how the parameter theta.\nlet’s say the height of people is distributed in the population, and this is before you see any data.\nIn addition to this, you also choose a statistical model\nwhich expresses what is the probability to observe the value. X.\nGiven that data has some, you know, value.\nNow comes the interesting part. You observe data x 1 up to Xm.\nand the idea is that using this data, you want to update your original belief, the prior\nand what you get is called posterior, it is the probability to get theta.\nthe probability for theta given all this data that you have just observed. Okay, so now we’re gonna derive a forward for it\nin case of a single variable. So when I talk about this expression.\nit really becomes probability of theta given X.\nThis is conditional probability, which we talked last time.\nand it is the probability of Theta and X divided by probability of X,\nand we can rewrite, write at the top the the numerator, as a product\nof the other conditional probability. X, given theta, which is our model\ntimes, P of Theta, which is our our prior.\nAnd then we use the rule of total probability for the denominator.\nOkay, now, in this formula, everything is known. It uses stuff that we already assumed.\nOkay, now, this is the case for a single data point. If I have many observations.\n1st of all, think about the statistical model.\nWhat is really F of X. What is the probability to observe? x. 1 x. 2 up to xn.\nGiven theta.\nIf these observation are iid.\nmeaning independent and identically distributed, it is just the product of each one of these. Xi separately.\nOkay.\nAnd this is called the likelihood function, this. L,\nso what you get out generalizing this formula, now\nyou see that F of Theta, given all these X’s\nis really this product we just defined above\nthe line above times F of Theta, which is the prior and then divided by some normalization constant. Okay?\nAnd what really it comes up to is that the prior\nis really proportional to our sorry. The posterior.\nThis one which we are trying to find\nis really the original one. We started with F of 10, which is our belief times this likelihood function.\nAnd let’s see how we do point estimation with this.\nWe are going to use this thing we just described the posterior to make estimation.\nThe point. Estimation, like the mean value, is just going to be the mean of this distribution.\nmeaning the summation of theta times F of theta given X.\nIf I want to do an interval estimation\nsuch that the interval obey, that the probability to be inside this interval\nis one minus Alpha. Think about Alpha is 0 point 0 5.\nIt really amounts to summing up all the probabilities between some 2 numbers A and B,\nand these 2 numbers, and we are going to define the interval for us.\nHow are we going to choose? Nb, we’re gonna find an a\nsuch that the left tail of the distribution is alpha over 2,\nand similarly the right tail of the distribution is alpha over 2,\nand this would lead to the equation above\nthat the probability to be inside the interval is the complement of these 2, which is one minus alpha. Okay, so this is the essence.\nEverything comes from the posterior in this approach.\nAnd this is an example here. How we do inter estimation. Look, how are we going to find Cnd.\nokay, I want to find. See? An interval such that the probability to be in this interval\nis 0 point 9 5.\nSo I’m gonna do what we said in the previous page.\nI’m going to find the parameter C such that probability to be less than C\ngiven X. Given the observed data\nis 0 point 0 25. That’s alpha over 2\nand bigger than D is also Alpha overturned. Now how exactly do I find it?\nRead this line, probability of Theta less than C given X.\nNow I do transformation of the variables. It’s the probability of theta minus theta bar, the mean divided by Tau, which is the standard deviation.\nSo I, I construct this variable here.\nthis transform variable because it is\na normal 0 1 variable. But since I did transformation on the left side\nof this inequality. I also have to do the same transformation on the right.\nSo now I call it capital Z, which is normal 0 1. And I need to solve now\nthis inequality or this equation, I need to find C from this. Okay.\nnow, we know about the pro, the\nnormal distribution, that if Z is less than about negative 2, I get my desired 0 point 0 2 5.\nSo this means that this quantity here C minus Theta bar over Tau should be negative. 2. Roughly.\nequivalently. It says that C is the mean minus 2 standard deviations.\nand similarly the other one. And this is the same kind of result you obtain also in the other approach.\nHaving said that, I want to move now to our\nmain topic for today, which is machine learning supervised machine learning.\nSo first, st machine learning\nis the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. What does it really mean?\nExperience mean? You show the computer more examples.\nthe more example you saw it\nthe better it’s gonna do. Let’s say we’re trying to identify\nobject. It will identify them better. Okay, the more that they will sold.\nWe distinguish supervised learning from unsupervised learning in supervised learning. The computer is presented with examples.\nAnd what we want the computer to say about them. For example.\nI saw the computer images of, let’s say, some animals, dogs, and cats.\nI show it an image of a dog. And I said, dog, cat, cat, and I do many, many examples like this.\nof all kind of dogs and all kind of cats.\nAnd I would like. So it’s like teaching a child. Right? So this is a dog. It’s a cat.\nSo you hope that the algorithm is going to learn a general rule\nthat maps the input. This is the image to the output, which is just dog or cat, 2 labels.\nThis is one task that we’re going to do today. Actually.\nnext time we are going to do unsupervised learning.\nIn this case, we are showing examples of dogs and cats, let’s say.\nbut we do not tell the machine that they are dogs and cats. We hope the machine is going to figure out by itself\nthat there are 2 kinds of objects here. It may not know to call them dogs and cat.\nbut it will figure out that they are really not. All the same. There are 2 groups here\nanother field in machine learning is called reinforcement learning.\nThis is actually a very exciting field. It’s just that it’s too complicated to do. In our short course.\nit requires also much more math.\nAnd this is about building an agent that is gonna perform in an environment.\nIt can be an agent that can play games like atari games or chess, or go whichever you want.\nor an agent that is driving your car automatically. You don’t do anything. You just tell it go to the supermarket, and it’s gonna do it for you.\nAnd this is a very interesting thing, and I’m I’m just mentioning it\nso you can go ahead and read about it. But we are going to focus only on the 1st 2 today, the 1st next time the second.\nSo in Tom Mitchell book. He’s at Carnegie Mellon. He defines. What does it mean for a computer\nprogram to learn from experience? E.\nWhat does it mean to to learn something. If you have to measure somehow how we learn how it learns\nwith respect to some class of tasks\nand performance, measure, how exactly you measure success if the performance\nis improved with experience, meaning the more data you give it in general, the better it’s gonna do.\nThere is a limit, of course.\nhow much things can be improved because even humans cannot do some jobs perfectly\nlike, let’s say I’m trying to recognize handwritten characters.\nSome people have sloppy handwriting. So it’s hard for me to figure out some characters and others.\nand this is, you know, inherent in\nmodern day machine learning. There are 2 objectives, the most important one, I would say, is to classify data.\nThe other one is to make predictions. So\nsome people think about AI and Ml, as\nin the left picture where everything in machine learning is part of AI.\nOther people think about it like this. For us, it doesn’t really matter. We’re gonna solve problems, specific roles.\nMachine learning relates to other fields. Also, okay, like data, mining is one of them.\nSo data mining is a field that evolved from statistics\nafter some technological advances that led to the creation of huge amount of data\nin the past. Statistic was about small data like it was in medicine, biology.\nAnd then machine people invented machine in different areas like material science, biology, medicine. And suddenly there was a huge amount of data. And the techniques of statistics were not appropriate.\nSo people created new techniques. And it all came into\nwhat data mining is. Okay, so\ndata, mining and machine learning employ same similar method. There are some overlap\nmachine learning is focused on predictions based on known properties, data mining. It’s about discovery of unknown properties.\nMachine learning also relates to optimization. Essentially.\nevery task that you’re gonna do\nis really formulated as a minimization problem\nminimizing some function which is called a loss function over our training data loss functions.\nOur specific company. We’re gonna learn today and next time.\nAnd they express the discrepancy between what the model predicts\ncompared to the actual thing. So let’s say, I should just show the machine an image of a dog.\nthe machine said, it’s a cat that there is an error here.\nOkay, loss function. Those functions are gonna measure this error for us\nin the purpose of training a machine learning a machine algorithm\nis to try to make this loss function minimized. So there will be the best\nmatch between model prediction and the real stuff.\nMachine learning also has some connection to statistics. Statistics\ndraw inference from a sample. Machine learning find some generalizable patterns.\nOkay? So there are some overlap between things. But\nthere are also differences which are very important.\nWe’re gonna use python, of course, for doing our machine learning. And there is a special package called S. Kit. Learn\nthat you need to install.\nIn particular, we’re gonna talk about some vocabulary in machine learning some concepts in machine learning. So if you go and talk to people\nin the field, you actually would be able to converse with them.\nWe’re gonna use a special. The module from python called Sk, learn.\nAnd we’re gonna talk about some of the most important approaches.\nAnd I will try to develop our intuition of how how they work. And I’ll do it by pictures. Okay, as many as much as possible.\nToday I’ll do what is called supervised machine learning.\nWe teach a machine like we teach a child, we show them examples, and we tell them, what are these examples.\nand then when you show them a new animal, let’s say, ask, what is this? And the kid usually would figure it out.\nNow, I just wanna mention that machines needs much more data than humans\nto learn what is, what is a dog? What’s a cat? And all that? Okay? In other words.\nprobably the way we teach machine is not how a brain of a child works.\nBut nevertheless, it’s all problem. So we are happy.\nSome applications. Okay, of machine learning.\nProbably the most important one is classification. So what is it\nyou are trying to teach a machine to classify object? In other words.\nyou’re gonna show the machine object from several types, several classes. Let’s say several.\nLet’s say I’m showing a machine handwritten characters, let’s say in English.\nso it has to recognize A, BCD, etc.\nSo it’s not so simple, because if it’s printed, a has just one form or 2 folds.\nBut if it’s handwritten, there are so many people and so many variability\nin the way things are written. Okay?\nSo in classification, that’s what we try to do. Teach a machine to distinguish between things.\nSo how we are going to do it. We give the machine labeled points point, meaning the data.\nLet’s say the handwritten character. And the label is, let’s say, this is A, A, BC, or the digit, 0 1, 2, etc.\nSo graphically, I’m gonna show a picture like this. This is a space\nit says, here, maybe you cannot read feature one feature 2.\nSo that may come in very high dimension.\nOkay, so if you take a TV image, for example, high definition, TV image.\nIt’s roughly 2 million pixels.\nEach pixel is 3 colors. So it’s 6 million dimensional object. It’s huge.\nSo we don’t draw a picture of a 6 million dimensional object.\nThis will be just the knowledge itself.\nWhen I want to distinguish things or understand them.\nWhat I do is I extract some features from the data.\nHow do we do that? We’re gonna learn next time.\nBut let’s say I did extract some features, let’s say 2 features.\nand I’m plotting them as dots in 2 dimensions.\nSo each one of these dots, let’s say it’s an animal.\nand all the blue ones are dogs, and all the red ones are cats.\nand, as you can see in the space of these 2 features.\nthere is a nice separation between those 2 sets, the blue and the red.\nYou want to teach a machine to figure out those 2 sets.\nOne way to think about it is to ask it. Can you\nseparate the space by straight line.\nso that each set will be on one side of it.\nWe’re going to learn how to do these things. This is just visualizing\nwhat we mean by classification, or one of those things we mean by classification.\nAnother problem is call regression. So those of you who know statistics. They know this stuff.\nbut I’ll present it here in a visual way, as follows.\nimagine we are given this data.\nas you can see, the dots are colored, not by 2 colors, but actually infinitely many colors going from yellow to purple.\nWe can ask the machine, can you\npaint the whole space such that if I give you a new point. I ask you what should be this color? You can tell me. The answer for this problem is shown graphically in the picture here.\nas you can see that everything was painted. We see yellow to purple.\nand you can see some kind of slanted diagonals here\nwhich you could also identify in the original picture. So the algorithm seems to have done a good job\nin this. In this case.\nlet’s go to other kind of problems\nclustering. So this now belongs to unsupervised learning the previous 2, where oops\nthese were supervised. Okay, so here we give data to a machine.\nThere are clusters in this data.\nAnd we wish that the machine actually will identify the clusters.\nWhy is this important? You may ask. Well, I’ll give you one example.\nImagine there is a new disease globally. Okay, like pandemic of some sort.\nAnnie seems that people don’t respond to the same drugs the same way. Okay, so\nit may be that some people respond better to drug a other to drug B and so forth.\nA picture like this that may identify\ngrouping in people based on the response to the drugs we give them may be very important.\nIt may tell me, for example, give this group drug a while, give this other group drug B, etcetera.\nSo using machine learning unsupervised machine learning\ncan be very useful in many areas in technology, in science, in medicine, for example, okay?\nAnd this is why, we’re gonna study some of these things. Here is a\ngraphical representation of the result of an algorithm.\nThey took the data and actually figured out those clusters.\nand we can see that it actually did what we would do ourselves\nif somebody asks us to color them. Okay.\nSo when machines seem to be doing what we would do. We are happy.\nsometimes we they do better than we do. By the way, another example, dimensionality reduction.\nLooking at this data, which is in 2 dimension. We also observe.\nthere is one dimensional data, not 2 dimensional. It’s actually going along some curve.\nAnd here is an result of an algorithm that actually figured it out. It identified it as a 1 dimensional curve\nand it colored, based on, you know, the distance from one edge to the other. Okay.\nwe’re gonna talk about this thing damage and it reduction.\nI think next time, okay, now, we’re gonna start doing some real stuff\nwe’re gonna use. 1st of all, you need to install the python package that does all this machine learning stuff.\nAnd this is the command for doing it. Pip. Install. You don’t have to do the minus u, but sk clear\nfor visualization. I sometimes use seaborne. So use this as well.\nNow as Kit learn. Come with data as well as with\nalgorithm. So if I go here and I type, sk, learn.\nYou see, I see different things here. You can browse this.\nI can see data. So 1st of all, you see, classification, these are class of problems, clustering regression, all kind of things here.\nI can look at data sets. Okay?\nSo sk, learn has all these data set iris diabetes, digits, etc.\nWe can use the digits from time time to time.\nThere are also something which are called real world data set\nfrom here. We’re gonna use this one, which is about faces of people. Okay.\nso this is just to show you some examples.\nSo asked, learning is is not about great data set. It’s just for educational purposes.\nSo don’t use data sets from sk learn when I give you an assignment.\nGo somewhere else.\nWhere do you go? Don’t know if I said it last time or not.\nGo to Kayl.\nMaybe I already show you this last time.\nSo this thing has more than about half a million\ndata sets. Okay, see the number here, 500,000.\nSo this is everything that you may want to use\nwhen it comes to askit. Learn, you have to import the data set\nand then load them. You know, as this example shows.\nIf I take the Iris data set, for example, so Iris data set involve\n3 classes of flowers of the Irish family.\nAnd it’s a small data set. It’s only 150 records.\nAnd each flower is being\ndescribed by 4 numbers. Okay, which are lengths and width of some part of the flower.\nand the pictures here shows Xi versus Xj on the off diagonal\nand the color represent the class. Okay, so I’m going to increase this a little bit.\nso we can see better the picture oops here.\nSo why am I showing you this picture?\nIf in one of these images there is a nice separation of the cloud of the colors.\nIt means that we can use this image to do classification. We just find the good separating line.\nand maybe the one shown here\nx 3 versus x. 1 is an example. Okay, you see, the blue is nicely separated, and even the red and the green don’t have really significant overlap. Okay, so this just to give you some intuition about the data set\nand the fact that this Iris data set is not really complicated.\nThe pictures on the diagonal show us\nhistograms of x 1 x 2 x 3, etcetera. Okay.\nfor the 3 classes in different colors. Histograms of the values. Okay, okay, so this is just\nagain, last time we talked about visualization. And this is it. Okay? Here, for example, using Seaborne, you can say, do for me pair plots of all the stuff you have in the data\nhere, it’s only for dimension. So it’s\n4 by 4 picture. It’s not so bad, but if I had a hundred looking at a hundred by 100 would be a bit difficult.\nSo I talked about this thing in the beginning today.\nAnd I will just continue. The reason why we do that\nis that we start with a method called\nnaive base classification. Okay, so this will be our simplest method.\nAnd now, in case there is not one algorithm, there are several algorithms.\nSo these models are very fast and simple.\nand they’re suitable even for very high dimensional data.\nAnd the reason why they’re so fast, it’s because\nthey have only few parameters to tune.\nSo let’s say, we are trying to figure out the label to dog.\nand we look at some feature f feature, maybe maybe the shape of the eyes or the nose, or whatever\nsome feature. What we want to do is figure out the probability.\nThe the label is L given. The feature is what you observe. F,\nusing the base formula, we have this. Okay, this is from last lecture.\nSo the probability of F given L,\nmeaning the probability of feature giving the label giving what the animal is. These things are. Usually, we know. The thing which may not know is FP. Of F. What’s the probability for a given feature?\nSo we can actually do comparison. If I have 2 labels.\nI can divide the 2 and actually get rid of this P. Of F.\nNow let’s do some coding. Okay, set. It’s no problem.\nSo what is this 1st example?\nThe Gaussian naive base is a method in which we assume\nthe the data, for each label comes from a simple Gaussian distribution.\nSimple Gaussian distribution, meaning it has a mean and variance.\nStandard aviation is is something, and the histogram, I mean, the distribution looks symmetric. It’s like circles. Okay?\nIn other words, there is no covariance between dimensions.\nSo the idea is that this method we’re gonna fit to each one of the classes, a Gaussian.\nand then, if we get a new point, we check the 2 Gaussians and see which one is bigger on this point. And this will be our classification method.\nLet’s do it in python. Now, okay.\nso I’m gonna give you today several codes about classification.\nSo what do we need to do?\nNumpy. We already learned last time\nwe did as well. Seaboard. I don’t know if I use it here or not, but that’s not a big deal. This one is important.\nWhen I teach you some new method, I will actually generate data\nthat I can control. So you will see what I mean by control.\nand so that I show you example where things work well and don’t work. Well, okay, usually, when you apply the algorithm, you take it from Kegel, let’s say.\nI also have to import the Gaussian name base in order to use it.\nStep one. I create the data and see, this is the function called make blobs.\nI’m gonna create 100 points in 2 dimensions\nwith 2 center meaning 2 classes.\nAnd I’m gonna control the standard deviation. So you will see, I play with this parameter.\nand you will see the effect of it on the data\nmaking the problem easier or more difficult for the algorithm.\nThe 1st thing that I do. I use a scatter plot. So these X’s now\nthey are pointing to dimension.\nI’m gonna Plot X versus y.\nand I’m going to give it. A color based on the label based on Y\nS has to is a parameter giving size to the dots.\nSo I’m gonna start running it.\nAnd we’ll see what happens first.st It’s gonna show us the 2 clusters.\nAs you can see. My laptop is not such a great machine. It takes time to run. This\nsimple thing\nthink the 1st time it takes is the Oh.\nhello, yeah. Here it comes.\nSo what do we see here? 2 clusters, blue and red, very nicely separated right\nnow, we’re gonna put Gaussian on each one of them.\nand then we’re going to cover the space random points in the space\nso we can get a sense of what? How does the classifier work? And here it is.\nYou see, the big dots are the data, the little dots.\nour model prediction for different places in the space.\nAnd you see nicely separation. And this is not a difficult case.\nI’m gonna make the run now more difficult by making the 2 clusters run into each other.\nSo now I will. I essentially did big, larger standard deviation.\nwhich means that each cluster will spread more. And you see.\nactually, I’m not sure if you can separate these or not. But you see already a problem right?\nAnd here it comes. Maybe it’s on the border of. Maybe there is a blue point in the\nred area or not. So we’re gonna make it even worse. Okay, I’m gonna make it\n2.5 year.\nSo it’s gonna definitely overlap.\nAnd then I cannot do perfect separation. There is a limit\nto how, as you can see, there are red points\nin the blue area, blue points in the red area. And you see, this is what happens. I cannot do a perfect separation.\nOkay, this is our 1st example, a very simple algorithm\nwhich just uses, you know, simple Gaussians to approximate things.\nNow, I want to emphasize that every algorithm has an assumption. Okay.\nthe data is this and that, and we’re gonna fit it with some shape.\nNow, it was about the Gaussian.\nThis algorithm is very easy to use again, think about this as a template.\nthe actual code. For just let’s just let’s look at something here.\nI want to actually discuss some things.\nI define the model type.\nOkay, model is Gaussian a base?\nThen I’m fitting the model. So you see, you don’t have to know, even in details.\nwhat are the parameters model. Dot fit will do an optimization and give you the parameters you need.\nAnd then there is model. Dot predict\nyou give the model any data you wish, and it’s gonna tell you whether it should be red, I mean, or blue, right?\nAnd I also predicted, you know, model prediction on some point here.\nAnd and just write it as zeros and one.\nSo what I want to say here is this.\nall our codes today are going to look like model is something.\nThen we give it the data model dot fit.\nThis is just plotting after that. And then model dot predict to evaluate the model on some data.\nthis data may be new data or the old data depending on the situation. We are running. Okay. So essentially, with 3 commands.\neach one of our models is gonna run. Thanks to\nthis wonderful package that somebody wrote for us.\nOkay, let’s continue.\nlater with the ta, maybe linear regression.\nSo first, st what is the problem?\nIt’s actually shown here. Imagine you have dots\nlike, you see in this picture clearly, our eyes immediately\nmake sense that this is a linear\npoints that are spread along some linear function.\nWe would like to find this function.\nSo I’m going to open a code called lean regress.\nAnd let’s look at it.\nSee? Now, I’m going to import linear regression. Okay? So what’s linear regression? It’s going to create a function. Y equals to a X plus B\nA is the slope. B is the intercept. Okay.\nNow, you could have done this by yourself if you don’t a little bit\nabout optimization. But we are doing it here now, as you know, he’s just using the python code\nstep number one. I create some random points, 50 points between 0 and 10.\nStep number 2.\nI define the function. I want to try to recover 2 x minus 3.\nBut if I just did this, the point will be exactly on a straight line. I want to add some noise to it.\nOkay, so I’m going to start running this so that you see the data\nI’m going to try to fit.\nIt’s essentially 2 x minus 3. Here is the graph. Okay?\nAnd it spread somehow. And I’m trying to fit a straight line through.\nAnd how do I do it? I say again, you see, the structure model is something. It’s linear regression this time.\nFit, intercept true meaning. Give me both the A and the B,\nso model is something, then model dot fit with the data that we have. Okay?\nAnd then I can do model, dot predict. Okay, now.\nthere is something here that X, that was given here was a list. Okay, our models look for\ndata in a form that each row is one data point. Okay?\nAnd so you actually expand the list into a 2 dimensional array. By this command you can actually try to print X and print this and see the difference between them. Okay.\nand let’s close this.\nAnd this is what the algorithm created.\nWe now put 1,000 points between 0 and 10.\nI will show you that it’s not really a straight line. I mean, these are really points.\nI’m gonna zoom, zoom.\nSee, these are really discrete points. Okay?\nAnd the algorithm is found what we would think intuitively, it looks good\nto be more accurate about the prediction.\nModel slope was 2.0 5 instead of 2,\nand the intercept was minus 2.9 9 instead of 3. So it looks like it’s doing a good job.\nIf I put bigger noise, things may look, you know, a bit\nmore with larger errors. Okay? And this is very, very simple. The linear regression.\nWell, what if our data looks like this? Linear regression is not going to do much? Okay?\nAnd now we need something, some generalization. So if before\nour function involved only a constant and a linear function, a 1 x.\nwe can say, let’s add more powers.\nWe can have 2. We can have up to 3, etc.\nAnd we can try to fit\npolynomials to this. Okay, in principle, we can try to fit. Not just polynomial, but some arbitrary, you know, functions. Okay, basis functions.\nLet’s look at this code. Now.\nthis is called poly poly regress. Okay?\nAnd I’m gonna just play with one parameter here.\nI’ll 1st make the degree one there is a parameter here that I want to play with.\nI’ll play with degree one. I know it’s not gonna be good, but I would like to visualize it.\nSo we generate the point. We put a straight line. It looks pretty lousy, right?\nSo I’m gonna do now. Quadratic, meaning degrees, too.\nAnd I’m going to run this. And\nthis looks now pretty nice, right?\nSo even degree. 2, you know, may be sufficient in many cases.\nI mean, I can do degree force if it’s gonna look better. I don’t think it will.\nIt seems that 2 was good enough.\nYeah, you don’t see much difference.\nWhat if I do 20 instead?\nI want to show you some effect here\nthat is undesirable, and you don’t want to go too high with polynomial degree.\nYou see the Wiggles in the red line now on the right and on the left.\nThey are, because the data seems to have some kind of imperfection there.\nIf I use more data, probably these would be removed. Okay?\nOr if I use less data, this will change. So this\nis something which we would call overfitting\nthe models. Try to be too specific for this data.\nAnd this is something which we do not want to happen in our models.\nOkay? So I don’t want to talk more about this. Let’s do to some\nvery powerful method called support vector machines.\nSo I’ll 1st explain the intuition behind it in a picture. Okay?\nAnd then we’re going to make a call that will run it.\nLook at the picture here on the right.\nwe have red points. We have yellow points, and they’re nicely separated.\nI can put all kind of lines that separate them. Okay?\nSo there is not a single solution\nin math. It’s not so good. Or when you write algorithm, it’s not so good to formulate things\nwhen you have too many solutions, you want to find, maybe the best of them.\nThe sense of what is the best is what this picture shows.\nIt’s about the margin. So you see, with each one of these lines there is a width that I can associate.\nand the width is such that if I make it bigger. It’s gonna over over on over the points.\nAnd what I want to see. 1st of all, I see the different lines\nhave different margins. Okay, different widths.\nAnd what I want to find is the one that has the maximum weights.\nThis would be the solution. Okay, so I I try to find the line, you know such that it separates the 2 sets\nin the biggest possible way.\nLet’s do it in Python. Now, this code is called Svm.\nSo 1st of all, there is a function here that I’ll I’ll minimize. So it doesn’t bother us.\nLet’s see about imports. Make blobs. We know they make blobs. We did it already with\nSvm, we’re gonna use. Okay, we’re gonna import. Svc.\nSvc stands for support vector classifier.\nAll the rest we know there is a function here. It’s gonna plot\nthe thing which you saw in the picture.\nthose dotted lines as well as the solid line. Okay, cool.\nWe’ll forget we are not gonna read this here. You can read about it later.\nFirst, st I’m going to create data.\nSo let’s run this and see the data.\nHere is my data this time. It’s green and yellow.\nAnd because I use C map to be summer, you know, you can choose anything you want here, probably winter and 0 number.\nOkay, now, I’m gonna use the classifier. How do I do it?\nModel is something this time. It’s Svc.\nand the kernel is linear. So this means\nthat I’m trying to separate the 2 sets with a straight line.\nWe’re gonna see later that we may want to separate it differently.\nI have specified the model.\nAnd now I do model dot fit. I’m gonna find the parameters of this model\nmeaning I’m gonna find the actual line. So this model dot fit command in different model. It is doing something else.\nBut we don’t care about it. It’s doing what it’s supposed to do. We get a model at the end.\nAnd then I’m gonna do model dot predict? Okay?\nSo\nI’m gonna plot.\nThe result, essentially. So let’s run this.\nOkay, it’s already showing us the point.\nAnd now it’s going to show us\nthe separating line. And you see, there is a width here which is positive. Okay.\nI’m gonna give the model a bigger challenge\nby making the cluster standard reaction bigger. Let’s say 1.5.\nSo I think now, the 2 sets are gonna overlap.\nand there is no way to separate them perfectly. Let’s see what the model is going to do now.\nas you can see, there are top on top of each other.\nSome green points went into the yellow region and vice versa.\nAnd here is what the model is gonna do. It’s running longer now, because it’s trying to do something.\nAnd, as you can see, the width is 0. Actually.\nit couldn’t find a width that completely separated 2 sets.\nThere is actually overlap. And there are some yellow points in the green area and vice versa.\nBut this is the best. It actually minimize the violation. Okay?\nAnd you see now what what this algorithm is doing. Okay, so this is our simple implementation of Sbn.\nthis plot function. You know, you can read it just to to plot these dotted lines and the other one. But even if you didn’t plot it, the model is there.\nYou can use it to do model dot predict anything you wish.\nSo, for example, you can put random points in the space\nand do model dot, predict, and it will color.\nyou know the top with reddish color and and other ones.\nWhat if our data look like this?\nThere is no way to separate them by a straight line?\nSo we have to do something more general.\nAnd what is more, general, we can do now. Circular lines, okay, not exactly circles, but closed lines. Instead.\nWhen one set is inside the other.\nIt makes sense to do it like that.\nLet’s look at the important part of the code. 1st of all, you see, instead of make blobs.\nI have another function make circles. This allows me to generate points\nthat are, you know, one is inside, one cluster is inside another one.\nThe rest is the same.\nSo I’m creating circles.\nAnd I control the noise somehow. Okay, we can play with the noise level later to see what we get.\nThen I’m doing the model. See? This time I didn’t call it model. I call it Clf. It’s any name you wish to use. You can use\nwhatever name you use here, you have to use it here when you do the 5th command.\nNow, you see, the kernel is called Rbf. Rbf. Stands for radial basis functions. These are like these closed curves\nthat are gonna separate.\nThe Svc has 2 important parameter. One is called c, 1 is Gamma.\nAnd again, you can go online to read about them. Okay, go through the code.\ngo to that site and see what they mean.\nI’ve defined what is my model.\nAnd then I’m fitting the model with my data.\nAfter I’ve done it, I want to see what’s the result.\nSo 1st I’m plotting my points, you see, X,\nand C is YY is the original label.\nC map is autumn. So this gives our some colors\nand let’s and then I’m gonna show the the\nyou know the separating things. So let’s let’s run this.\nOkay. Here it comes. You see.\nI have 2 sets. They are not really exactly circles inside each other. But we have found the algorithm is found\na nice way to separate them.\nI’m gonna play a little bit with the noise level.\nSo I actually make it 1st smaller\nbecause it was big from a previous class.\nAnd now I make it smaller. And you see, it’s almost circles right? Very big separation of the 2 classes.\nAnd this code, it’s randomly generating the point. And if I run the same thing again.\nit’s gonna look different. Okay, see, this is different than the previous one.\nSo you know, sometimes you want to see different. Sometimes you want to see the same. It all depends on what you do.\nHere is another one which is different, but for the same parameters.\nSo now I’m going to increase this to 0 point 3, maybe 0 point 25.\nAnd I’m going to have, you know, harder problem to do.\nOops.\nYou see, the model is begin to do all kind of nonsense stuff. Okay, there is no good separation here. I’m going to write again\non a\nand run run it again so that we can see that there are problems. Now.\nThe noise level is too high. This, actually, it made it still. But I run it again, and it will not. So you know, if I want to make really difficult.\nI’m gonna put 3 here. And this time the modem actually cannot do the job.\nThe clusters are not really separated.\nYou see, it begins to create islands and all kind of stuff like this. Okay.\nso let’s put it back to one so that you can run it and see nice results.\nSo all. What it take to do was this, rbf, okay, you can play with C and see what it will do.\nOkay, I’ll let you actually do that yourself, oops. Wrong window.\nOkay? And here is our, you know, example in the in the lecture.\nSo this I just wanna emphasize that Svn is a very good algorithm.\nSo when you do your project for presentation at the end of this course.\nI really recommend that you try Svm as one of the methods\nyou can do the naive base. As you can see, the model. It’s implementing stuff is really simple. It’s 2 lines of code.\nMaybe one more line to do model dot predict, you know.\nbut anything we do here. The the packages are already so well\nwritten that it’s just a matter of writing 2 lines of code\nto actually run one model or another.\nOkay, now we come to our most difficult examples. Okay.\nand this is face recognition. I’m gonna open the code for it.\nAnd I’m gonna describe it in details.\nIt’s called faces. Svm, so\nokay, so let’s see, what do I need to do? We’re gonna do Svc like before\nwe’re gonna do also a couple of other things. One of them is called Pca\nPca is a data reduction algorithm that we are going to learn the details of it next time.\nWhy do we need to do it?\nSo here the images are.\nyou know, maybe almost 3,000 pixels each image. So it’s kind of 3,000 dimensional, almost.\nwhich is pretty high.\nAnd it’s a common practice when you have something that big or even, you know, bigger. Of course, you want to reduce dimensionality so that the classification problem becomes more manageable. Okay.\nyou probably don’t need all the 3,000 dimensions to figure out\nwho is whom in your pictures okay? And Pci was is gonna get, let us do that. Okay, so we’ll\nsee how it is implemented and what it means we see next time\nmake pipelines. So this one is a function that\nwe use for doing complex algorithms. So we 1st do Pca and then Sbc.\nokay, that’s the pipeline. Okay, we have 2 things here. The Svc is the classifier.\nBut before we do it, we actually reduce the data with Pca\nfw, this is the function that grabs the data for us. Okay, we saw it in the the website\nof a scale learner.\nWe have another thing which we haven’t used before. This is called train test split.\nSo now we get real data.\nand we don’t want to do training and testing on the same data. So we’re gonna split the data into 2 parts.\nOne part we use for training.\nWe can attune the model on this data.\nThen we’re gonna show them all the new data\nand ask it. What do you think it is? Who is this person? Okay, this is a more serious\nway to evaluate model than just giving it the same data.\nWe’re going to look at errors and performance in 2 different ways.\nOne is called Cross-classification Report, which will show us\nfor each class what was the precision?\nAnother thing we’re going to show is something called a confusion matrix.\nWe’re gonna show for each class\nhow many times it was actually predicted it right, and how many times it predicted it on some other class for each one of the possible classes.\nOur algorithm, which is Sbc.\nHere’s some parameters. We don’t know what values they should be for a difficult problem. You want to tune these parameters.\nSo this would mean that we need to optimize over the parameters of our algorithm.\nSo we’re gonna do something called grid search\nmeaning we’re gonna put the lattice on the parameter space. And we’re gonna try all possible combination over some lattice\nand see which model gives the best result. Okay, so this is just introduction\nto what exactly we’re gonna do.\nNow let’s try to do it.\nFetch the data.\nSklm, give us this function, fetch and the Lfw people.\nand it’s gonna give it as a dictionary with all this data.\nand you can do print faces to see all the keys of the dictionary.\nBut I’m not gonna do it now. You can try it later.\nAfter doing it, you see that you have target names, meaning the names of the people.\nYou have images which are the images of them.\nAnd what I do here I print images, dot shape\njust to see how big is my data.\nThen what do I do? I create a small array of images 3 by 5,\nand I’m going to show the image of each one of the 1st 15 faces, and\nwith each one of them I’m gonna set\na label which is the target name. Okay for this image.\nSo let me begin by running this.\nand we are going to see some of the faces and how complex they are.\nSo I’m gonna increase the size of this. So we can\nhave a better way of seeing the labels just a second. Yes.\nokay. Now we can see better. Right?\nWhat I want you to take from this in this little snap\nsnapshot of the images is that this Guy George Bush appears many, many times with different facial expressions.\nand you know, maybe you can identify the same person in all of them.\nBut I think this shows you how complex the problem is\nlike here, for example, in picture number.\nor from the left, the last row.\nYou see, he’s laughing above it on the 1st row. He’s just maybe puzzled. But you know, it’s\nit’s really difficult problem to try to do\nso. Where is the code? Here it is. So until now we ran. We reached this point.\nNow I’m gonna read a few more lines, and then we’re gonna let the code run. And they see whenever I’m doing plot of something, the code stops there. And until I I remove this picture.\nI mean, I don’t continue. So let’s first.st It’s actually good for teaching.\nAnd let’s see where we are.\nWe showed the pictures. Okay. Now we come to do the actual modeling.\nSo first, st we have to define what is the Pca. That we want to do.\nand number of components is the important parameter\nit tells me. Something I forgot to\nsee. I printed some stuff here, and I want to look at it.\nHere it is. These are the names of the people which is not so important.\nWhat is important is the shape of the data.\nSo I have 1,348 pictures.\nEach. One of them is 62 by 47 pixels.\nIt’s not exactly 3,000. It’s less. But you know.\nokay, so this is my data.\nOkay. Now, what I do now is, I take this data and I do, Pca.\nAnd I’m reducing it to a hundred 50 dimensions. Okay, we’ll see next time what? Exactly it’s doing here.\nWhat does it mean?\nI take an image.\nI do some calculation on it.\nCan I produce a vector of size? 150?\nAnd I do it to all the images now, now, instead of\nsitting in a thousand 3,000 dimensional space.\nI’m in a hundred 50 dimensional space where each dot represent an image in the real real space.\nWhat I hope to do is to do classification on this reduced space.\nAnd we’re gonna try 150. We’re gonna try, then, 25. We’re gonna try to understand. You know what we can do.\nSo Pca is gonna reduce dimensionality. Then we do Svc with Sbc, we do Rbf and\nmake pipeline is the thing I mentioned before you 1st do, Pca. And then you do. Svc, okay, and this is your model.\nNow.\nwe haven’t run the model yet.\nNext, we take the data and split it. Okay.\nso test train train test, split, you look at the data which is faces no data.\nYou look at the target, which is faces the target. And you see, I want to create train version and test version for it as well as to the labels. Okay?\nSo I splitted the data.\nNow, this Svc that we mentioned before.\nYes, let’s go to online documentation.\nAnd\nokay, so sk, learn.\nSvc, I want to see the a little bit about\nthe parameters.\nI probably need to do a different one.\nOkay, see, this is the Sk. Learn. Svm, okay. Svc, and\nyou see, there are parameters. C is one of them. The default is one.\nThere is another parameter called gamma. Okay, there is also some default, and there are more parameters kernel.\nwhere you can do linear, which we did first.st\nThen we did. Rba. But there are more of them. Okay, so you can read here if you want to know more about it. Okay, there are really a lot of parameters. I usually don’t do more than what I show you\nin this.\nSo any disco. Yeah, okay, so\nso what we are going to do now, we’re going to define a parameter space for C and Gamma\nC is gonna run between one we will be 1, 5, 1050.\nGamma will be these numbers that you see on the right here.\nand what we’re going to do now we’re going to run the model for each pair of combinations of C and Gamma.\nAnd we’re gonna see which one does the best.\nAnd this will be our model.\nAnd you see, when I do grid dot feed.\nI can ask, what is the best parameters? Okay?\nAnd it will tell me actually.\nand my model is, gonna be grid best estimator.\nso it will pick the estimator corresponding to the best combination of C and gamma.\nNow, if your C. Comes out to be 50. Maybe you want to increase C again to some higher value. Don’t be on the boundaries of this thing. Okay, try to\nget value so that they are inside your tropes.\nbecause if it’s really on the boundary, let’s own 50, maybe better. Parameter is a hundred.\nOkay? Now, once we have found the model we are going to do model dot predict on the test data. So let’s close the image we saw before.\nAnd let’s wait and see what comes out. So now we’re gonna we did model or predict.\nAnd now we have a piece of code that is gonna visualize it. Okay.\nso I’m waiting for it to come\nagain. This is this, I said, is the most\nintense model we do in class for this course.\nand we have to wait a little bit to get the results.\nNow, once it’s\nthe other thing, once it’s plotted for us, we’re gonna look at it and see some stuff. But this is a classification report.\nIt compared the test value and the fit value.\nlike, what is the real labels.\nand what is the model predicted labor? You see why fit is model dot predict.\nand it’s gonna do a report for us. It’s gonna see how many times it was done wrong, etcetera, etcetera, produce a report.\nIn addition, there is another piece of code which is about\na matrix that shows all kind of combinations of the error. So we’re gonna see not only a summary of report\nfor the precision we’re gonna see? For which classes there were errors.\nAnd what were the errors? Okay? So we see, you know what was difficult in our problem.\nwhich person was difficult to identify.\nand what kind of errors we did with this person. So let me increase the size of this.\nThis is, you know, a sample of the first.st What is 4 times 6, 24 people. Okay, in the data.\nred meaning, we did it wrong.\nSee the bottom red? It’s actually should be George Bush. It says it’s Tony Blair.\nOkay, so these just give us some sense of the errors that were done with our model.\nI’m going to close this, and we’re gonna read the report. So the report is shown here.\nI will increase the size of it\nso that we can see it.\nOkay?\nSo 1st of all, look at this this line. We didn’t read before.\nIt says that C value is 5,\nand gamma is 0 point 0 1. If I look at the range which I gave it.\nso maybe we are in a good range.\n5 is not the minimum. It’s not the Max. So it’s good.\nand 0 point 0 0 1 is not also. So this is good. We don’t have to do\nto extend the thing.\nBut now look at this, there is the parameter called precision.\nThis guy. What was its precision? It was 65%,\nmeaning 65%. It was done right. And it the 35 was done wrong.\nAnd other people, I think, are better. Look at this guy, George Bush. 97% accurate. Okay, which is impressive.\nWhy is it printed twice?\nI have to see whether I’ve done something wrong here.\nOkay, let’s look at the confusion matrix. I’m gonna read, white printed several times in a second. And what we see here is let me increase the size\nand the y-axis. It’s the predicted label on the X-axis. It’s the true label.\nSo if things were only on the diagonal, it would mean that the the model is doing a perfect job.\nBut look at the number 10 here, which is in the second row, 4th position from the left.\nThe real person was George Bush, but 10 times it was predicted the scoring power. Okay.\nso these pictures, confusion, matrix, it hold, shows us what kind of errors were made with our algorithm.\nI really have no idea. 1st time I notice it that it’s printing several times.\nI’m going to open the code to see why it happened.\nHi, it may be a display call, okay, fine. In that case, I don’t have to check.\nAnd yeah, I’ve never seen this before.\nOkay, let’s see that we printed it only once.\nYeah, we printed this classification report once, but\nthere is some issue with the display. Maybe if I come down.\nNo, it’s still there. Okay. So probably some bugs\nin my Vs code. Okay, so what do we take from this?\nSo this is a difficult problem. Relatively.\nwe have managed to get accuracy, which is in the range of 80, some percent. Let’s look at it again.\n82% overall.\nAnd remember, the freedom we have in the algorithm is in few places, right?\nWe have decided to do dimensionality reduction, 2\n150 dimension. But maybe it’s too much. So let’s do 25, and let’s rerun this\nand see if the errors, if the accuracy is still good.\nthis is repeat itself. So we just close it.\nAnd now it’s doing the actual calculation.\nIt’s 25 components. So it’s faster to run than before. And\nagain we have to wait a little bit.\nNext time, when I talk about Pca.\nI will actually show you\nsome methods to figure out what should be this number. How did I know that\n25 is not enough? Okay, we’ll we’ll go and talk about this.\nSo you see that we have many more reds than before. Okay, maybe more than twice.\nAnd if I look at the reports, let’s see, there are more overall. There are more\nYou see. Now it’s 64 it was, and\n82 or something like this before. Right?\nOkay? So we still have to figure out\nhow to to determine the parameter here without actually running it again and again and again. Okay, because there each run may take a long time, and we want\nto get a better sense of it. And next time, when we talk about Pca.\nI will show you how to do.\nHow do we guess this?\nOkay, I just spilled my cup of tea on the table. But it’s okay.\nOkay, next.\nSo this is the code and everything you can see here. Similar.\nSee, the results are not gonna be the same because it’s choosing split of test and train in a random way.\nOkay, next, our next algorithm is decision trees\ndecision trees are very intuitive way to classify data. Okay, so essentially, you ask a series of questions.\nSo let’s take this example. We’re trying to find what’s the animal.\nSo we may ask the question.\nis it bigger than one meter or less than one meter?\nIf it’s bigger, does it have horns? Or you have this? So after a series of questions.\nyou come at the bottom to\nthe classes. They are sitting right here.\nOkay. Now, mathematically, you think about it in the following way.\nwe have points in space some space here. I do it in 2 dimension\nor visualization. But think about it is, you know, very, very high dimension, and\nthe asking of the series of questions\nreally amounts to chopping the space\nby some form, by some line.\nand separating one side from the rest.\nSo look at the top. The 1st picture here\nI separated the yellow, most of the yellow from the rest.\nThen I looked at the rest, and I separated the green from the rest.\nand I keep doing it again and again and again.\nSo this is in essence. What a decision tree is.\nWe’re gonna go to some improvement of this which is called Random Forest.\nThe Random forest model is essentially an ensemble of decision tree\nbut randomized. What do you mean by randomized? Let’s go back to the picture.\nThis one I used here in this illustration, vertical and\nhorizontal lines. But when I look at the data, you see, it seems to\nthat some diagonally lines will do better better job.\nSo the randomness may be in the direction of the lines. Okay?\nAnd in oops\nin a random forest, we’re gonna take randomized decision tree meaning decision tree with all kind of angles. For example.\nthe thing is, the training as well as prediction is very fast because\nof the simplicity of the decision trees. We’re gonna run a code in about about it. In a second\nthe task can be parallelized. So if you have a machine with Gpus, it can be done each\ndecision tree runs on a different gpu, and you can put 1,000 of them together, you know, in in and run really fast.\nMore important than this is that the multiple trees\nallows you to give probabilistic classification. So let’s say.\nI get 99% of the trees. Say, it’s class a 1%. Say, it’s class B, I’m not gonna think twice. I’m gonna say, it’s Class A,\nbut if it says 0 point 6 or 60% is class A and 40% in Class B,\nmaybe I shouldn’t jump to a conclusion that it’s really class A,\nmaybe I should give the result as a probabilistic, as it gives me.\nAnd what? How do you get the probability? Essentially\ncheck? What percentage of the trees gave you one class versus the other? Okay.\nso this is actually a very useful information that can come out from this model.\nThe model is very fast. And let’s actually do it. Okay, so I’m gonna take\nthe code which is called Random Forest.\nI see it’s not in this directory, so sometimes\nI don’t finish this in the in one lecture.\nSo I actually put it in a different folder.\nAnd we’re gonna go there.\nRandom forest.\nSo now we’re gonna do random forest on\nand data set of the digits. Okay, so let’s see how it goes.\nSo what we have to do here, let’s see numpy pipe load\nlow digits. This is a function that takes from sk, learn the digits.\nSo I should say that these digits are very crude. They are 8 by 8 pixels.\nWe’re gonna do the same trends and test split as before.\nimport metrics like before we gonna do confusion matrix.\nAnd we’re gonna do the random classy or forest classifier\nin the Random Force classifier. I can\nsay how many trees I want.\nAnd this is the main parameter I am going to use\nto study what is happening here.\nI’m gonna load the data.\nI’m gonna print some stuff just to get some sense of it. What are the keys in my data in in my dictionary?\nWhat’s the shape of them, and so on.\nI’m gonna make a figure of\n8 by 8 figure of digits just to see how they look. Okay. And with each one of them. I’m gonna print the label also. So just I see.\nyou know that I recognize it.\nThen I’ll split the data.\nOkay?\nAnd\nso then I do my model. My model is Random Forest Classifier number of estimator. Here I put 150. Let’s put one.\nIf I run this code with number of estimator is one. I’m really doing a single decision tree.\nSo I want to do the purpose showing you that the single decision tree is really not enough.\nSo model is is specified. Then I do model dot fit and then model. Don’t predict\nthe predict I do on the test data.\nThe feed on the train data with the train labels.\nThen I want to do the classification report. This one takes\n2 things, the predicted and the test\nand the real stuff. Okay, the known labels.\nAnd it’s gonna do statistics on these 2 sets and tell us the result.\nAnd again, like before the confusion matrix again, you give it the same thing.\ntest and predict notice that they are not in the same order here and there.\nand that’s it. So let’s run this.\nI want to see some printout first.st\nOkay, so let’s look at this 1 1st\ndictionary. You see, I have data. I have target.\nI have images. So you know, I have everything I want right?\nAlmost 108, 1,800 images.\nThey are each of size 64. And this is the dimension.\nThey are actually shown up as single vectors of size 64.\nBut they’re actually 8 by 8 pixels.\nHere they are.\nIt doesn’t look so nice because it’s only 8 by 8. So maybe if I make it smaller\nyou can see the digits better. But\nthe labels printed with them are confusing the\nthe visualization, but I think you can see it’s not great images, but you know.\nprobably you cannot tell every image what it is.\nbut in most of them you can.\nWe are going to talk about a different data set of images called mnist.\nwhere each image is 28 by 28.\nLet’s continue.\nWe did a single tree, remember.\nAnd here is the result. 0 was classified correctly, 95%, 8, only 69%\nto also 68% overall. It’s 0 point 8. Not so great. Okay?\nAnd this is what a single decision tree is going to do for us.\nWe can run it again and again. But let’s do more.\nOkay, so where is my number of estimator? Now, I’m gonna move to 1010 trees.\nAnd this thing run really fast, so we can play all kind of games here.\nOkay, it printed the thing. It shows us the images.\nAnd now it gives us the result with 10 trees.\nYou see, 0 was classified perfectly, which one is bad\noverall. It’s 95%. Okay. So this begins to look really good. Let’s do more. Let’s do 50 trees\nbecause it runs really fast. You can actually experiment with it.\nAnd if you do anything like this in a project.\ndon’t show us the result for a single number.\nShow us, for you know, several choices. So I have to close this for it to run.\nOkay.\nSo now I’m doing 50 trees.\nAnd this result, this is the same as before.\nAnd the result gives me is 96%. Okay.\nso I’m gonna do more. Okay? And maybe I’ll do 150 and\n96 is already pretty good. Right?\nWe get now 98, with a hundred 50.\nOkay, so 198 is probably\nas good as it gets. Well, let’s put put 500.\nYou see, we can afford big numbers here because the algorithm is fast.\nSo this will be the last thing I ran.\nAnd here it comes.\nIt’s still 98. Okay?\nAnd you see, the confusion matrix tells us which kind of errors we made.\n5 was thought to be 9.\nNo, these are the 2 label.\nOh, yeah. 5 was predicted as 9. 1 time.\n2 was predicted as one.\n4 0. You know things like that.\nSo this confusion matrix tells us also, what kind of errors are we?\nSo this is a good place to stop. I’m gonna give you 2 assignments today. One\nis about the stuff we learned last time.\nand the other one is the lecture that you know we have here\nand there. There is more in this lecture. I’ll give a version that stops here, and I think\nI’ll just open the assignment here. So I can\nmake sure that it covers up to the red.\nYeah. No applied classification. Gaussian aim based Svm rental forest\npick a data set of your choice from kaggle\nshows error like confusion, matrix, and accuracy. So you will get codes that do this almost.\nBut you have to to do it to to your own data. Okay.\nand this is due next week on Saturday. Okay, so you have enough time to do it.\nThere is also assignment number one, which is about\nwhat we learned last time, which is the probability stuff.\nAnd there was something here which I, changing to\ncolor white so you don’t see it.\nSimulate the birthday problem as the lecture one shows and simulate the Clt central limit theorem.\nas shown on page 49 in the lecture. Okay.\nSo this is the homework for today. I will send you all the files I’ll send to the Ta. And he’s gonna send you.\nand I hope you have enjoyed it. Next time we’re gonna have more fun with unsupervised learning.\nAnd after that we’re gonna do\nneural network that is deep learning, which is the most exciting part of this course thanks everyone for listening.\nand I hope you enjoy stuff, and I will see you in about a week.\nOkay, bye-bye.\n"},"03_resources/Video-Conferencing,-Web-Conferencing,-Webinars,-Screen-Sharing":{"title":"Video Conferencing, Web Conferencing, Webinars, Screen Sharing","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe DS204 Professor Class (25Summer-Prof. Ta’asan) lecture covered foundational data science concepts. It began with data visualization using Python’s Matplotlib, demonstrating various plotting techniques (X-Y graphs, multiple plots, histograms, 2D histograms) and emphasizing data preprocessing and feature extraction. The lecture then transitioned to probability theory, defining core concepts like experiments, outcomes, events, conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem. Practical applications of probability were illustrated through examples such as medical test reliability, spam filtering, and the Monty Hall problem. Basic combinatorics (permutations and combinations) were introduced as tools for probability calculations. The session concluded with an overview of random variables, the Central Limit Theorem, and its properties, along with homework assignments involving CLT simulation and the Birthday Problem.\nKey Points\n\nData Visualization (Python/Matplotlib):\n\nImportance of visualization for data insight.\nTechniques: Simple plots, multiple plots (subplot), histograms (with density, bins, transparency), 2D histograms, kernel density estimation.\nConcept of feature extraction for visualizing high-dimensional data (e.g., digit classification).\nRecommended resource: Kaggle.com for datasets.\n\n\nProbability Fundamentals:\n\nDefinitions: Experiment, Outcome, Event, Probability.\nSet operations: Union, Intersection, Complement.\nConditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).\nRule of Total Probability and Bayes’ Theorem, with practical examples (medical test, spam filter, Monty Hall problem).\n\n\nCombinatorics:\n\nPermutations (N factorial).\nCombinations (N choose K formula).\nApplication to probability calculations (e.g., tournament problem).\n\n\nRandom Variables:\n\nExpressing outcomes numerically (discrete vs. continuous).\nCalculating probabilities by counting (e.g., sum of two dice).\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem (CLT):\n\nDescribes the tendency of sample means to follow a normal distribution.\nIntroduced concepts of mean (Mu) and standard deviation (Sigma).\nProperties of normal distribution (e.g., 68-95-99.7 rule).\n\n\nHomework Assignments (for next week):\n\nSimulate the Central Limit Theorem in Python.\nSolve the Birthday Problem (calculate probability for a given N, find N for 0.5 probability).\n\n\n\nShlomo explained the importance of calculating conditional probabilities accurately, using a medical test example to demonstrate that intuition can be misleading. He showed that while the test had a 90% positive rate for those with the disease, the probability of actually having the disease given a positive test result was only 8%, highlighting the test’s limited predictive power. Shlomo then introduced Bayes’ theorem, explaining how it can be used to relate different conditional probabilities and emphasizing the need to consider both true positives and false positives when evaluating a test’s effectiveness.\nShlomo demonstrated how to build a spam filter using probability theory, showing that emails containing the word “free” have a 95% chance of being spam. He then explained the Monty Hall problem, using probability formulas to prove that players should always switch doors, as the probability of winning by switching is 2/3 compared to 1/3 for staying with the original choice.\nShlomo discussed probability concepts and random variables, explaining how to calculate probabilities by counting outcomes for dice rolls and other scenarios. He introduced combinatorics, including permutations and combinations, and derived the formula for combinations using factorial notation. Shlomo also covered the concept of random variables and their applications in probability, using examples like weather outcomes and die rolls to illustrate different scenarios.\n\nzoom.us/rec/play/3gwKQfBTYH2f6b4FNlNoFeBtA-F1qL4ai90wv7Cpa4O3CQvak5EPRdlV-Bq8LCoOR1Gknm2TOjc8lw.nXLgtvysuKGvKUXh%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FG6K5EOTI-er5-rqdjOP-eX0gwVeoRTne2BiQID8GpkvC31t12BtdMDj9oimZva4j.ZJBhpur0Ggn7brav\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 02:20:26\nAudio Transcript\n\n00:33:44\nHey? Can you hear me?\n00:33:49\nYes!\n00:33:50\nOkay, good.\nHello, everyone. And welcome to our course on data, science and applications\nmy camera seems to having some issues. So you probably cannot see me.\nIt’s not detected. And it happened to me in the past. Then I fixed it. Now it’s not working again.\nI really have no idea. Okay? So\nyou can hear me, I guess, if not, just say on the chat box, if there is a problem with sound\nso today we’re gonna do 3 things.\nWe’re gonna talk about visualization, about some probability and statistics, visualization using python.\nThen I review probability I try to make things with a lot of pictures.\nand we’re going to do a little bit of statistics as well.\nThe 1st step in understanding data is visualization.\nThis gives the best insight.\nThere are different ways. We can visualize data.\nSimple plot is one. This is when we\ntry to do X versus Y graphs, for example.\nsay, I have stocks over some time.\nand I want to understand the trend. I will do stocks versus time to see that.\nSee uptrend, downtrend, etc.\nSometimes I’m trying to understand some\ndifferences between classes between groups, let’s say\nin medicine, I have groups of people who are healthy versus group of people who are not.\nAnd I’m trying to understand using my data, what’s different between them.\nSo I will do some graphics that is about clustering.\nAnd we’re gonna see all of these today. So you’ll you’ll understand what I mean.\nIn other cases I’m trying to understand\nhow likely events are to happen. Let’s say today it’s 45 degrees where I am.\nI’m just kidding, I’m trying to see. Is this really a typical situation or not?\nOkay? So we are wanting to know about 3 types of visualization types.\nAnd it is important to understand that any of these.\nmaybe not on the original data, but on some kind of\npre-processing of the data. First.st By some algorithm, we usually call it features.\nWe take the data, we extract some features out of it.\nand we plot those features in order to understand\nproperties of the data that we have.\nSo I will be using this environment for coding. It is Microsoft Vs code.\nAnd they’re all the same. I mean, you can use by term if you want\nit doesn’t, or just use either that comes with\nthe system. So if you type idle. Here you get another oops.\nI should type either here, and it should give it to me.\nI didn’t type either correctly. And this is the python environment that\nyou already have. If you install python.\nIt’s bare minimum. Okay? So I know. Be in the past. I use it. But then people say, Can I use the nicer one? And here it is.\nSo.\nBefore you can do any of these visualization. I show you today on your computer.\nyou have to do some install of packages. Okay?\nAnd here I do. I recommend these 2 pip install numpy and pip install macbook lib.\nNumpy is all kind of fancy math, stuff, vectors, matrices, functions, etc.\nMath plotly is our actual visualization package.\nThere are fancier packages than this. But for our purposes this is more than enough.\nSo let’s go back to the slide.\nOkay, so\nsimple plot is this, here is an example. You see, it’s based, essentially, y versus X kind of graph. Okay, so we are going to go over this.\nWhat? I’m trying to figure out. Yeah.\nOkay, so let’s go over it. I import smart plot. Lib\ndot pi plot as Plt. This is a short name for the long thing here.\nwhich we will be using for our visualization everywhere.\nI begin by defining X, so I have to do X and a Y, okay\nline space. This means a linear space, linearly spaced points between 0 and 50, involving 1,000 points.\nThe actual plotting command is here, Plt. Dot plot.\nI give it X, and I give it. Y,\nthe Y value in this case is just a function I generated. I use sine function cosine.\nand the command that actually show this stuff is plt dot show\nif you run on on Jupiter. I think you don’t have to do the Plt. Or Cho, but I never use it, so I don’t want to give you advice.\nI’m not perfectly okay with, I’m gonna run this code\nand we’re gonna see some stuff right away. Here it is. Okay. So notice that\nthe graph I have in my lecture here.\nIt touches the X, you know the boundaries of the graph while\nin here it doesn’t. Okay? So this is because\nhere I’m using a different version of python than I used when I wrote this lecture. Okay, you notice the space that it puts on top and bottom.\nIt puts the graph a little bit inside. Okay.\nalso in the graph, you see more. Only 2 waves.\nHere. I have a lot of them. And it all has to do with this. How many points I took? Okay.\nSo if I run it again with less points, it will actually not less point less.\nHere the X value is less.\nI’m going to see a different boom.\nWow! You see, this is more like in the lecture.\nAnd you see there is a dash line and a solid line. The colors will speak by the machine. I didn’t do anything to for doing that. Okay, this is our simplest starting point\nfor the simplest possible graph.\nOkay, let’s continue.\nSometimes I need to put graph 2 graphs side by side.\nThis may be, for example, when I’m trying to plot\nlike one of them will be the y values in the thousands.\nand the other one the Y value in the teens, so they will not\nlook nice if I plot them together.\nSo for this purpose we use the command\nby subplot. Okay, Subplot is going to create for us an array of plots\nwhich we can decide to be of any size\nhere I did different than the lecture. I did 3.2.\nSo this means 3 rows and 2 columns.\nAnd to put some specific graph into them. You use the index one up to 6,\nand I’ll run it so you can see exactly what it does.\nAnd here it comes. So you see, picture number one is on top left.\nLast one is on bottom, right.\nAnd you see how how it looks. Okay.\nagain, very basic thing. So in the lecture. I think I have a 2 comma, 1, 2 comma one.\nand that’s a 2, and I’ll write it again just so that we can reproduce what we have there.\nAnd here it comes. Okay, this looks more like\nthe one in the lecture. Okay?\nSo you see, the subplot command is this new thing.\nand we are going to see example later on. We’re gonna do 8 by 8, when we have to do\nmany plots showing some images or something else.\nOkay, there is also another syntax for doing multiple plots. This is the page about it.\nWhen I say, the code has some bugs, I mean, few lines are missing. Okay.\nI you. It’s enough for us to do the other one this upload.\nBut if you want, you can go and learn this one as well.\nnow we come to plotting several things. So let’s say, I’m plotting now the temperature in New York City, in Tokyo, in Beijing, in Paris.\nin Moscow, etcetera, I’m gonna use a different color for each one of them.\nand I would like them all to be on the same graph, same image.\nSo I need to specify color. Okay. And this is done by specifying color in one of the following ways.\nI can give a particular one of those lines.\ncolor by name, like blue, red, green, or by code. And these are the 7 codes which exist.\nI can do grayscale, and put some number between 0 and one.\nand there should be a gray one. So you can see the 1, 2, 3,\n1, 2, 3. That’s a gray.\nI can put a hex hex code for the\ncolor. So each 2 letters represent the number between 0 and 2 55. So Ff is 2, 55,\nor I can do the Triplet, RGB, by value 0 to one.\nSo there are many choices here, of course.\nsometimes I want to control the line style. Okay? So you see here different styles.\nsolid dash, dash, dot, etc.\nAnd I do it also by specifying the command\nlines. Type. Okay, so this is very, very obvious, very trivial. To understand what’s going on\nlines that I can either do by a word or by a code. Okay, dash is\nsolid. Dash, dash is dash, etcetera.\nSometimes I want to control both the color and the style.\nand I do it by combining the codes with the 2 of them together like the solid grain\nthey’re saying, etcetera, etcetera. Okay, so everything is pretty pretty simple here. Okay?\nAnd this is when we do graphs of X versus y. So these are the simple plots until now.\nNow we’re gonna go further before that.\nSee, this is not so important. But this is\nso. The 1st one I control.\nWhere is the image relative to my my frame.\nI can put bigger spaces here in the front, in the back\nor not. But the important thing is the next graph.\nI can put a title. I can put label in the X place in the Y place.\nand the command of doing it is this euro\nplt dot title. I put anything I want there.\nX label and Y label, just what they are.\nOkay. So I have a little bit more control over how my figures are gonna look like, okay.\nwe mentioned histograms. So histograms is about trying to understand the frequency of events.\nfrequency of events. It’s it’s important. It’s some probability probability concept.\nAnd we would like to be able to plot things so that we can get sense of\nthe probability of different things. 2 different events\nhere I generated random data in this line.\n1,000 points, randomly distributed, run without an n.\nA random number between 0 and one run with an N at the end is\nGaussian distribution with 0 mean and variance one.\nSo I do generate the data, and then I do plt dot east.\nIt generates this picture. Hey? This is the histogram.\nIt counts how many times a given value or given range of value appear.\nThe weakness of this, as is, is that if I get a lot of data.\nthe Y-axis will go to high numbers, which is not desirable. So\nI want to normalize. Okay, so that’s 1 thing normalize.\nI use it with the command. Density equals. True.\nBut that’s not all. This seems to be too cruel of a representation.\nand I want to go to more resolution in the X direction.\nAnd I do it by the command, by the keyboard bins\nequals 30 here. It’s basically 10.\nI also.\nsometimes I’m interested in multiple graphs\nwhich may overlap. So if I don’t have transparency, it’s not gonna work.\nAnd this is transparency. Alpha equals 0 point 5.\nHe got between 0 and and 1 1. It’s not transparent at all. 0, you can see through completely your turn.\nSo this was generated. Alpha.\nThe following picture is, I have a few histograms.\nand I’m generating with them. With Alpha equals 0 point 3.\nDensity is true. I always do, because I like to see probabilities.\nand you can definitely see through them, each one through the others.\nbecause Alpha is 1 0 point 3.\nOkay, again, very, very basic stuff.\nNothing special.\nI may want to do histogram in 2 dimensions.\nwhich is shown here. You divide the X and the Y space into how many numbers.\nand there you count in each block, in each box how many\ntimes disappeared, and you plot it with some kind of contrast.\nHere, you see, I put a color bar, which is this thing here?\nAnd I also put labels on the color bar right?\nNo sorry the labels came with the color bar, but the label here, what it means\ncomes by the command set label.\nSo what do I do this? Okay, I need to do histograms in 2 dimensions. If I\nI’m in a two-dimensional case. For example.\nI look at the temperature and humidity in all those cities, and\nI take one city at a time when I put the histogram.\nAnd I’m seeing how frequently is. Some is each combination of humidity and temperature.\nOkay, if I’m not happy if this looks too crude. Okay, like pixelated.\nI can go and use something called kernel density estimation. It will fit some Gaussian or other shapes.\nAnd you see this is a nice and smooth function here.\nActually, we don’t really need this. This is enough. But you know, it’s up to you.\nOkay, the next diagram. This is about what I said clusters.\nSo let’s try to understand what we are seeing here on the top, I have an array of digits.\nThese come from sk, learn, sk, learn! We’re gonna talk about it later on.\nand understand what what it can do for us.\nNow each of these images we cannot see it. But I’m telling you it’s 8 by 8 pixels.\nSo quite crude.\nNow, to visualize things in 8 by 8, which means 64. Dimension is not so easy.\nwe actually cannot do it. We have to play all kind of games to understand something.\nWhat we are going to do in this particular example.\nWe’re going to extract 2 features out of these images.\nWhat are the features? It’s a different question. Here it is done by Isoman.\nThere are other ways to do things, and I’m plotting here\nfeature one and feature 2, each coming from a different digit represented by a dot.\nIf it came with the digit 0, I mark it as red as a blue. No blue. I think it’s actually black.\nIf it is number 3, I mark it as pink, or something like that, and so on.\nWhat I can see now is that\nin the space of features feature one feature 2.\nThe different digits occupy different regions.\nThere is only a little bit of overlap between them.\nAnd this is actually very good thing that I would explore later on, when we talk about classification.\ninstead of trying to distinguish the digits by looking at the full image like you see here on top.\nThis is what our brain does. Okay, we immediately look at it, and we know what you’re seeing\nfor the math part for machines we’re gonna maybe want to give, not the full image.\nAnd here, you see, trying to understand the problem of classification\nor the problem of Give me a new point. I’ll tell you what it is\nessentially amounts to dividing the space into regions\nwhere in each region there is one, or mostly one color. Okay.\nwe’re going to talk more more about this later on.\nNow, these 2 features that were created here\nare coming from something called Iso Map that we’re going to discuss in lecture, you know, 4 or 5 whatever 4, maybe\nmaybe 3.\nEssentially, it extracts some nonlinear quantities out of this data.\nWe’re going to talk about more of them. Several\nthings under the manifold learning category. Okay?\nSo again, you see, this is an example where\nI had objects belonging to several classes.\nHere it’s to 10 different classes, each forest a different digit.\nand I’m trying to plot them in a way that would make sense. So I can\ndistinguish them in some kind of reduced space\nreduced because I don’t want to calculate a lot. I want to do the minimum amount of calculation that can give me the answer\nthat I want, and they answer, What do I want?\nI want to look at one of those things\nand say, is it a 1? Is it a 2? What is it.\nData sets. So our data sets or\nno idea, what is this? But let’s go to the era.\nI’m going to power kegel.com.\nOkay, so canker is a place for a huge amount of data.\nYou see, more than half a million data sets.\nSo probably every topic that you come in mind.\nit’s gonna be here, there will be some data about it.\nThese data sets are also having usability parameter. If it’s 10, it’s good. If it’s lower than 10 watch for problems.\nThere may be. See, these are all 10. Okay, the last one was 0 point 8.\nSo\nit’s missing something. Okay? So when it’s not. Then something is missing. Okay?\nAnd you see, they’re actually huge number of data sets that we have here.\nI jump to 9 to 13 to etc. It’s half a million things.\nand if you trying to do something like either in the homework assignment\nor later on the project, it is good that you look, search, search\ntoday or after today, between today and next time, actually, next time is tomorrow.\nSo maybe tomorrow, before class try to browse this thing and see whether\nthere is something that really exciting, exciting.\nOkay, see? They’re also by topic. Classification is a topic.\nAnd you know, you may find some interesting things here. Okay.\nit’s everyone is different. So whatever you’re interested in is is fine.\nso this was written when there was Covid. And you know we had a lot of question about what to do with Covid and all that.\nSo this is the beginning of our lecture, which, just finished\nand which focused on visualization.\nAnd again, I cannot stress how important is visualization. Okay.\nmany times, just by visualizing the data. I know what to do. Okay?\nAnd of course, there are cases where you look at the data, it looks so complex. You, you look at the picture, and that doesn’t tell you anything.\nSome data is tough.\nSo our next topic is probability.\nWhy do we need it? You may ask. We’re doing data science here. Why do you begin to do probability we don’t like probability.\nThe thing is that probability concept of probability are backbone of many important quantum in data science.\nfor example, inferential, statistic, busy network and more.\nAnd we understand statistics. You know, we have to understand probability\nin statistical inference. We try to understand the population\nfor analyzing a sample which is much smaller. I’ll give, you know. Particular case.\nSay, I want to know what is the average height of people in Europe in Tokyo.\nI mean measuring the height of millions of people is not a practical thing.\nSo what do I do? I go to random places in the city. I pick a person or 2. I ask them to marry their height. If they are\nokay with it. I’m fine. I’m doing my table.\nAnd then I get the average\nnumber of all those measurements I did.\nand this serves me as an estimate for\nwhat is the population? You know me and Ben?\nThere is, of course, in statistic tools that tell us how much errors I’m gonna get with this and all that.\nAnd this is just an example.\nSo let’s go with 2 probability. What is probability.\nWhen we look at life there are always many uncertain situation.\nI look outside the door now. It’s sunny, but you know it may rain tomorrow.\nI would like to know how likely it is because I need to know whether to pick up my umbrella or not.\nI have a math test. Tomorrow\nwill I pass it? Well, I haven’t studied much recently.\nand etc, etc. So there are many questions in everyday life that\nthere is more than one outcome, and you know you would like to somehow give weight to the different possible outcomes.\nThis is what probability does.\nIt gives high value, like close to one\nfor things that are very likely to happen, almost sure, 90% or more.\nSo to mathematically formulate things. We have to come up with some concepts.\nExperiment is one.\nThese are the uncertain situation. For example, will it rain today? Yes, no, there are at least 2.\nOutcome is the result of a single experiment. We waited to the end of the day, and it rained. So the result is it rained with the outcome.\nAn event is an important concept.\nIt is one or more outcome from an experiment. Okay?\nProbability. The most important concept is a measure of how likely an event is.\nAgain, this is only one interpretation of what probability is.\nAnd this is what we’re gonna take for the rest of our ari are both.\nWhen I say that there is 60% chance. It will rain tomorrow.\nWhat I mean by this is that if this condition of today.\nif I look at them and in the history of my data.\nand let’s say I see a lot of them there. Enough enough of them. I can see how many times in the following day rain happened.\nand I would guess from this.\nthe probability of rain for tomorrow is, let’s say, 0 point something\nnow. So why do I care so much about probability? Because\nplanning in uncertain situation is very beneficial.\nThe simple example of the rain. If I know that it’s gonna rain tomorrow with high probability.\nI should get my umbrella in a completely different setting.\nIf I have the business in my family history.\nI should be worried about it. I should take steps.\nMaybe I should eat healthier, maybe I should exercise, and all those\nwe can plan according to probability of future events.\nIf an event has very small probability, like probability of rain tomorrow is 0 point 0 1%. I’m not going to take my umbrella. But if it’s 98%, I will definitely take it.\nOkay. So it’s about planning accordingly.\nNow we come to some real stuff, some formulas, some concept.\nSo\nwe’re going to think about events, a subset of something bigger.\nLet’s go on.\nOkay, yeah. In this slide. I forgot to mention the sample space.\nSo this is the set of 4 possible outcomes. So it’s a set. Okay.\nan event will be a subset of this. Okay? So we’re gonna I am going to\nschematically draw the sample space as rectangle.\nIf it’s a continuous sample says it’s good. If it’s discrete.\nI should actually make a few dots of the plan\nand say, This is my space.\nIn any event, events are subsets of this thing I call here Omega.\nSo Omega is going to be the sample space. Anything is a subset of omega.\nBut since we are talking in the language of sets\ntheir natural operations on set, that we might want to consider union of 2 sets.\nI combine the 2 and make one bill sets containing them.\nIntersection of sets. This mean what is common to the 2 sets\nlike it is this banana shaped between the A and the B.\nI can also talk about the complement of a set.\nSo it means it’s those things are in Omega\nwhich are not in my original set. So, as you can see the yellow.\nHey? Hello!\nIs the complement of this a red.\nSo let’s write a few forwards.\nProbabilities scale scaled so that things are gonna be a 12 1.\nThe probability of Omega is one probability of the empty set is 0.\nSo you may ask, where do I get the empty set from.\nWhy do we need to deal with them? They said so. Think about these 2 sets, and be here.\nIf they did not intersect, the intersection would be empty.\nSo we need to talk, be able to talk about the empty set and what to do about it.\nSo we would like the probability of the empty set to be 0.\nNow, if I look at the picture bottom here, right.\nI can see that a union with a complement, the C on top of the A means complement.\nthey said, a union, a complement gives us all a formula.\nNow the probability of Omega is one.\nso the probability of the complement will be\ndefined is this, remember, P of a is at most one.\nSo one minus P of A is not negative number.\nWe should never get negative numbers. In probability.\nNow, I would like to motivate this more fancy formula.\nI would like to know what is the probability\nof the area on the top picture. The area inside is apple-shaped.\nWell, I can see that it’s made up of the red shape, the blue shape.\nThis gives me the whole apple. But\nthere is an in-between, a Bareno shape that is calculated twice, both in A and in B,\nso that’s not good. I should count each point only once.\nAnd here is the way I do it.\nSo think about probability as being the area. So it’s easier to understand all these equations\nlike, let’s say on the previous thing. Here.\nThe area of the complement meaning the area of the yellow side is one minus the area of a\none is the area forming all right.\nSo now this formula, so the yellow what’s inside the yellow, the area of it\ncan be thought about as the area of a plus the area of B,\nbut this area in between, we’ve calculated it twice when I was in A and when I was in B,\nbut I need to calculate each point only once.\nSo I’m going to subtract PA intersection. B, because I calculate this one twice.\nAnd here is the famous formula.\nand when understanding just by looking at pictures.\nOkay, now, we’re gonna practice this stuff.\nBut when we do, we’re going to take examples where\nOmega is discrete, like in here.\nSo in this case, the way I will think about it is, I have 5, 6 dots on the page.\nand the total weight of all of them is one.\nSo I’ll take the symmetric case that each point gets one over 6 after the total.\nSo the probability for each number now is going to be one over 6\nnow, and of course P. Of Omega will be one.\nbecause if I have, the weight is one over 6, and I have it 6 times. The total is one.\nHow do I interpret probability of an event? So again, what is an event? Now\nthink about Omega? These are 6 possible. Number an event is any subset.\nTake, for example, the 4 5 set.\nIt has 2 elements.\nSo I’m going to think of the probability of A\nis the number of elements in a divided by the number of elements in Omega.\nSo it is 2 out of 6.\nWhat is a compliment?\nLooking at as 4, 5. The complement is 1, 2, 3, 6, so the probability of complement\nis one minus p. Of a\nP of a, we calculate it’s a 3.rd\nSo this one minus it is 2 thirds.\nSo notice that\nprobability of a plus, the probability of the complement is just one. This is this line here.\nOkay, let’s take something more interesting. I look at the set\nfor event B, which says, the result is even\nso, this means we are dealing with 2, 2, 4, or 6\nresolving. Odd. It’s a compliment, is 1 35.\nNow, I’m gonna take the event A from above\nand event B from below here.\nAnd I wanna see what exactly is A and B, this the intersection.\nSo when I say a end.\nthis is like intersection A or the or meaning union.\nYou will see that what is common to A and B is just the number 4.\nSo when I look at A or B,\nthese are the 4 digits here, 4 numbers here.\nYou see, there are 4 of them, 4 out of 6\nhere. It’s 1 out of 6.\nSo P. Of A or B by just counting that I have 4 out of the 6.\nI just write it more. I’m gonna use this for more role above P. Of P.\nWhat is B of A is here.\nP of A is 2 over 6\np. Of B is 3 over 6, and the intersection is one over 6.\nI get, you know what I need.\nOkay? So we started with simple meaning of the what’s a probability.\nAnd now we’re gonna go to something even more important, which is conditional probability, because in life\nthis is the thing that happens, the most\nwe are dealing with conditional probabilities.\nand we need to know what to do about it.\nSo the meaning first, st there is a formula here.\nand there is a picture here, and I’ll explain both of them.\nYou can take this as a definition and read it.\nThe probability of a given B meaning given B, meaning B already has happened.\nand it’s written as probability of the intersection\ndivided up by the probability of B,\nlet’s go here. What’s the intersection?\nIt is this yellow shape, yellow area\nP of B is the green area.\nSo the conditional probability of a given B.\nSee, when you say, give and be, you change Omega to become B, so everything is relative to B, now.\na inside B is this yellow part.\nSo the yellow part.\nthe ratio of the yellow part to the green part is what we care about. Okay.\nSo this is just a definition. Okay, now.\nwe’re going to do something with it.\nWe’re going to find a very, very important role to help us solve a lot of problems.\nLet’s consider this picture, Omega, which is this rectangular shape.\nis divided into the union of\nb, 1 b, 2, etc.\nThe all the B’s together. They cover all of Omega, and they do not overlap\nautomatically. We write it like this.\nOnly guys b, 1 intercept, I mean union. B, 2, union, B, 3, etc, etc.\nAnd the important thing is that b, 1 union. Bj.\nbi union, Bj, is empty. This means there is no overlap of the sets.\nNow we consider this red shape here. It’s an event, a.\nAnd we ask ourselves what is the probability for this event day.\nSo since we think about probabilities area.\nthe area of this red shape\nis really the sum of areas of a intersection, each one of those B’s.\nSo you see, P of A is P of a intersection b, 1 plus\np, of a intersection, B, 2, etc, etc.\nProbability of intersection is usually difficult in application. And instead.\nwe use this formula, you multiply by B\nby the probability of B both sides.\nSo you see each one of these intersection, probability of intersection\nbecame a product of 2 things.\nEssentially according to this, you see, this means P of a intersection. B\nis P of a given B.\nTimes, P. Of P.\nSo now you see, I change\neach one of these probability of intersection with a product of 2 things.\nthe conditional probability and the probability\nfor the elements, the set b, 1 b, 2 b, 3, etcetera.\nSo this is called the rule of total probability, and it is extremely important\nin many applications, we are going to use it.\nOkay, let’s do a conditional probability example.\nI’m tossing the die.\nSo I’m asking the question, what is the probability\nthat we are going to get the number 4\ngiven that the result is even. In other words.\nwe don’t see what’s happening. We flip somebody that can see things.\nHe knows that things are even\nright. And he asked us, he tells us the result is even what’s the probability.\nSo the result is, even it means it’s the 2, 4, 0, 6.\nThe complement of this to result is all this. 1, 3, 5, a. The result is for\na intersection. B, so 4. Intersection with the 2, 4, 6 is just the number 4,\nand then we can use the conditional probability formula.\nIt is P of A and B, divided by P. Of B. And you look at how many elements I have in A and B\ncompared to how many elements I have in B. And I see it’s 1 out of 3.\nNow we’re going to get ready to use the rule of total probability which was explained here.\n01:33:16\nMaybe.\n01:33:19\nQuestion, okay, so oops\nOmega. You see all the numbers between one and 6.\nThey’re either even or old.\nright b, 1 or B 2, and there is no intersection between even and old.\nso probability of each one of these sets is a half, because we have exactly 3 numbers 0 3. Here\nnow I take a subset forming a.\nThe digits are 3 and 4.\nWhat’s the probability for this? C.\nIt is 2 numbers out of 6. So it’s 2 over 6 is 12 over 3.\nBut I’m going to do it using the total probability formula.\nSo I 1st in this form, when I 1st see, okay, this is my Omega.\nI have to chop it into some pieces\nso that they cover everything, and they don’t overlap.\nSo this is exactly our b, 1 and B, 2.\nSo the probability of C is\nthe probability of C given b. 1\ntimes the probability of B, 1, 2,\nand then probability of C given B 2 times P. Of B, 2, etcetera.\nAgain, this is just the definition. There is nothing fancy here. We’re coming now to some interesting example.\nSo this example shows us that\nit’s not our intuition are actually not good when it comes to conditional probabilities.\nSo we have a medical test for the Zd, it’s a covid something.\nThe result of the test can be either positive or negative.\nThis table here show us the different probabilities, probability of a disease.\nand the test is positive is 0 point 0 0 9, etcetera, etcetera.\nNow, I’m going to calculate. Now, what’s the probability to get positive result if\nI know that the person has a disease.\nSo, using using the formula for P of plus given DI get 0 point 9.\nSimilarly, probability of not getting the disease. If\nwe don’t have a probability of getting negative. If we don’t have the disease.\nyou calculate it based on this, on this table, it’s also 0 point 9.\nSo what does it mean? It means that this test is pretty good, right?\nBecause sick people get positive result, 90% of the time, healthy people get negative results.\n90% of the time. So this looks like it’s a good test.\nBut if we think about what is the value of the test we have to think about the following.\nsuppose that you go and you take the test, and let’s say you get positive.\nI mean, why do I take the test? I’m not sure I have, Covid.\nI go, and I take the test, and I get confirmation. I don’t.\nSo here it’s about. What is the probability that you have the disease given\nthat you got positive in the test?\nSo intuitively, we would say 0 point 9. But it’s wrong.\nCorrect answer the probability of d even positive. You see, this is the important probability to calculate from all this guess.\nHere it’s probability of plus given DI know I have the disease.\nso you know not a big deal. But here I don’t know if I have the disease.\nThe only thing I know is that I got a positive result. So sometimes it may actually\ndrive me crazy because I may have a very bad disease.\nbut sometimes I just look at it as a joke.\nSo now let’s calculate.\nI take the test. I get positive. You see, when you you want to know if you have Covid. Right? You go and take the test.\nThe test. You’re says you’re positive. Does it mean you have Covid? Well, sometimes, sometimes not really.\nSo. What is the probability that you have the disease. Given that you got positive.\nwe would say 0 point 9. It’s actually not.\nThis is the important part of any disease test to see to what extent\nit predicts the disease. Given that the result is positive.\nSo you see the probability of positive result given.\nNo, the positivity. Sorry the probability of disease.\nGiven the positive result.\nI just use the definition of conditional probability.\nAnd I plug in the stuff from the table.\nI see that it’s 0 point 0 8. Very, very low.\nI took the test.\nI sat in line for a long time, told me, I’m positive.\nBut see, with this test. With this data.\nthis really means I have the disease with probability of 0 point 0 8.\nSo this test is actually pretty lousy. Okay, I would like these probabilities to be very, very high in the nineties.\nThe lesson of this exercise is that\nwe should not trust intuition. We would have\nthought.\nThe result is 0 point 9.\nBut it actually came out to be 0 point 0 8 very, very low.\nSo this test is, test is, is, doesn’t have any predictive power.\nThis example tells us, do not believe your intuition. Just calculate these few formulas\nwhenever you run into some relevant thing.\nthe next thing is due to base. This is the base formula, very important thing, in probability.\nBut so we go back just a second to to here.\nLook at this formula, it’s a probability of a given B.\nYou can also the probability of B given A,\nand if you do both of them, and rewrite them as follows.\nyou can see that the 2 2 left side are the same.\nSo therefore, the 2 right hand side must agree as well.\nSo what this would give us is an equation that relates\none condition of probability to the other by flipping the order.\nNotice that this formula does not use the a intersection. B,\na intersection B is usually difficult to calculate in problems.\nSo now let’s go back to our medical test. We would like to understand how\nSo we have a disease.\nA, the person is infected.\nWe have a test. B, we have a test, and the test came out positive. This is Event B.\nNow, when a company develops a test.\nOkay? So it did its chemistry. Now it has the material.\nIt has to prove that it’s working. So it takes some sample.\nIt collects volunteers, and it’s gonna do the test on them.\nNow.\nP of A is the infect the percentage of infected people in the population.\nSo how am I going to know this?\nI’m gonna do the sampling language for? I’ll take a thousand people.\nand I see what percentage of them have the disease and who don’t, though doesn’t.\nThis will be P. Of a. The probability that the person is infected.\nNext, P. Of B. Given a. What does it mean?\nProbability of getting positive.\nGiven that we have the disease.\nOkay? So in Step one, I took a lot of people.\nI tested them.\nOkay, okay, so I should add, here\nI’m developing a test. Usually it has to be a test which is very cheap.\nbut there are other means to do the test which are more expensive. In the case of Covid, for example, I can do\nX-rays and get confidence about infected versus not infected.\nSo P. Of B. Given a is the probability that the test is positive.\ngiven that the person is infected.\nSo this means in Step one I took I mean, maybe a thousand people.\nand I tested them now, using expensive measures like X-ray, and whatever\nnot the simple test that cost me a dollar to do\nsomething that may cost much more.\nand I know which of these people that I took sample of.\nWho are these people that are ill and versus healthy?\nI give all of them my test.\nIn a measure.\nI give all the infected people the A people.\nI give them a test, and I see how many of them get positive. Not all of them get positive.\nand I see the fraction of them that came positive.\nThis is P. Of B. Given A.\nSimilarly I look at the probability of getting positive results from the non-infected people.\nwhich I also know who they are, because I tested the number one.\nA lot of things get in high tech wedding.\nNow, what is my question?\nImagine that you go to the clinic.\nYou take the test and you get positive result.\nThe question is, what is the probability that you are infected\nautomatically, we want to do P of infected giving the positive result\nbase formula, tell us that we can relate it as follows.\nI find one conditional probability from the other one, and some additional stuff.\nNow the weakness of this formula P of a, you see, is known from above\nP of B. Given A, it’s also a non-ruba.\nWhat we don’t know is P. Off B.\nSo when we don’t know something like this.\nwe are going to stick to the low\nlow of total probability.\nYou see, if I look at Ana complement\ntogether, they make up everything right. A person is infected.\nA compliment person is not infected.\nthe person can be either one in one of those sets.\nSo then, I’m using the rule of total probability\nAnd I get this formula. Probability of B, given a times probability of a plus probability of\nbe given, not a times probability of multi. Okay.\nwe take now an example, a practical example. Now.\nwe’re gonna use this base formula to design a spam filter.\nTo see this is something useful\nto do this. I look at my email in the last couple of years.\nand I divide it into 3 categories, spam\nlow priority email and high priority.\nNow, I went over my email and I know what spam and not not what is not spam.\nAnd I find that 70% of my email spam 20%.\nThey were low priority and and the rest.\nSo see here, I have a sum of one, the set spam low priority and high priority.\nThey’re all this joint.\nThere is no intersection between it.\nNow I notice that the word free appeared in many emails in the letter spam.\nSo I want to try to build a spam filter based on this word.\nWhat is the probability of the word free? Given that it’s a spam email?\nWell, it’s pretty high. It’s 0 point 9.\nThis mean 90% of the\nemails in the spam category have the world free in them.\nBut only 1% of the no prior priority\nhave the word free in them. And similarly, 1%\nof the high priority have the word free in them.\nNow I got a new email just now.\nAnd I detected the word free in this email.\nWhat is the probability that it is a spam?\nWell, we’re going to use the base phone again.\nI would like to know? P of a given F.\nSee what I’m giving above is P. Of F. Given a.\nThe probability for the seeing the word free in my spam folder.\nSo we are going to.\nWe’re going to express P of a given F.\nSee? It’s not this one, it’s a different, or this one\nSo this is just the total probability. Okay.\nno, this is just the base formula. And now comes the total probability\nwhich is going to help us calculate what is the probability of F\nmeaning to find the world free in an email.\nSo\nI go now. P. Of FI do the rule of total probability to find out what is P of F,\nso I can do it based on ABC, right?\nBecause the 3 of them together make up everything.\nAnd I just write it like this.\nSo if you notice. Now P of a given A is given above P of a is above\nP. Of F. Given B is known.\nEverything is known in this formula.\nso now I can put it all together.\nI’m going to use this formula, the base formula.\nand I’m going to plug in your F from here, etcetera, etcetera.\nAnd I get 0 point 9 9 5. What did I just discovered if\nI got a new email?\nAnd I saw the word free in this email.\nThe probability that it is spam came out to be 0 point 9 9 5,\nonly 5 in a thousand. I’m gonna miss. If I use this forward\nanother example. Example. So previous example was about spam filter.\nNow, I’m going to do another example. It’s called the Montey Hall problem. It’s a very famous problem.\nIt was a TV show in 1975,\nI guess, before all of you were born\nthe host was called Monty Hall.\nand the game was the following, there was this place, which is 3 doors\nbehind one of these doors there is a car, let’s say, Tesla car.\nor if you don’t like Tesla, take a Bmw. Or something like that.\nThe car is placed randomly behind one of these doors. Now you come. You’re the player.\nYou pick a door.\nIf the car is behind this door, the car is yours.\nbut it’s not the end of the game. You pick a door. Then the host tells you\nhe actually opens another door out of the 3.\nActually, one of you pick a door, but you don’t open it yet. That’s important.\nThe host. Then open another door and show you that there is no car behind this door.\nHe then gives you the option\nto switch your door to another door.\nand the question is, what should you do?\nSo in the beginning, when the game started, people didn’t understand what to do, they played a game.\nand then a mathematician wrote the answer. In the newspaper, you should always switch.\nYou should switch to the other an open door\nand let’s analyze it, using base formula.\nSo event number one H.\nThe car is behind the door we picked.\nMonty is opening a door for us, right? So this will be another event. E.\nMonty shows us a door with no car.\nWhat is P. Of E.\nWhat’s the probability that Monty showed us a door with no car? It’s 1\nhe knows where the car is, he’s always gonna do it.\nWhat is B of age?\nThe chance that we pick the right door is one out of 3.\nWhat is P. Of E. Given H.\nThe probability that Monty opens a door with no car\ngiven that we picked the right door.\nIt’s always one multi always does\nin the no switching, switching strategy. We keep the choice.\nOur choice chance of winning is P of H. Given E.\nWhat is HH means we pick the right door. E.\nMonty shows us a door with no car. Okay. So P. Of H. Given E.\nSo now P. Of H. Given E, using the base formula\nis P of E. Given H. Times, P. Of h, over P. Of E,\nand if you plug all these numbers from above, you see you get one over 3.\nNow let’s keep analyzing this.\nMonty opened the door, which there is no car behind it.\nThe probability so the car can be either in the door we picked.\nor in the door the other door that Monty did not open. There are only 2 choices.\nthe probability that it is behind our door.\nHe’s 1 h 3, 1 3.rd\nThere is only one door, which is the option.\nso its probability must be two-thirds twice as much as ours.\nSo we should switch to that door.\nOkay? So here I write some comment in red.\nYou can write the python code to simulate this game and see the result for its strategy\nswitch or not switch.\nSo I recommend, if you have time, try to do this, I mean\nfor tomorrow. It’s a bit difficult to do in one day. But try.\nand if you would like next time next time, meaning tomorrow, if you ask me.\nI will show you a python code that does this and produce the numbers\n1, 3rd and 2 thirds respectively.\nOkay, these are some practice problems. You don’t have to do them. Okay. Only if you care\nmath problem. This is like the spam filter, but in a completely different setting.\nOkay, we come now to another\nimportant concepts. In probability these are called random variables.\nLet’s say, then, we denote the random number variable by X.\nTake the rain example.\nIn this example we can have 2 choice. 2 things can happen.\nIt will rain, or it doesn’t rain, or it didn’t. So we can say, X is either 0 or one.\nLet’s say we toss a die.\nThe die result can be 1, 2, 3, up to 6,\nso the X will be any number from the set, 1, 2 up to 6\nx can attain any value from this set\nin other cases. Now, I’m gonna toss now 2 dice.\nand I’m going to sum the results.\nSo\nif I have one and one, the sum is 2, if I have 6 and 6, the sum is 12,\nand check that I can get any numbers between 2 and 12.\nIf I think about the temperature tomorrow, say in Tokyo.\nit can have any number. Okay, I’m just gonna exaggerate if I put for minus 60 to 60.\nBut it’s a continuous vibe and not discreet.\n1st thing we’re gonna do is calculate probabilities by counting.\nSo let’s do the toss in the example.\nAssuming that the die is fair.\nit means that there is equal outcome to each one of the 6 numbers, which is one over 6,\nso x can be one, and its probability is one over 6\nx can be 2 with the same probability and so forth.\nNow I’m gonna toss 2 of them.\nand I’m going to check the sum\nso the sub can be any number between 2 to 12,\nand to figure out the probability for each one of these I’m gonna do counting.\nHow can I get the sum to be 2?\nThis is only if I do one in the 1st one, in the second, there is only one choice\nout of all the 36 choices.\nWhy? 36. Because the 1st die can be any one of the 6, the second, any one of the 6.\nAll the possible pairs are 36 of them.\nHow can I get a 3?\nI can do? 1, 2, or 2, 1 right.\nThere are 2 cases out of 36.\nHow do I get a 7,\n7. I can do by 6,\nby 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3,\n5, 2, and 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3,\n6 cases out of 36,\nand so forth. This is so, this is doing calculation by counting.\nAnd I get a a shape that looks like this. Okay.\nit’s highest in the middle, and it goes down at the end.\nSo if I want to know what’s the\nhow likely it is to get 8, what’s the probability to get 8?\nI can define X equals one. If\nthe sum of the result is 8 and 0. Otherwise, okay.\nokay, we have an ultrasound, very basic combinator works.\nBut it’s very important. It actually helps us\ncalculate probability in many, many cases.\nSo let’s start with the simplest situation.\nI have 3 objects, and they are different. I call them A, B and C,\nand I want to organize them in a role one after the other.\nThe question is, how many ways I can do it.\nI actually have listed all the possible ways right here.\nwhich means there are 6 possible ways to do it.\nNow, can I explain this number of 6\nin a rational way. Well, partly. Yes.\nSo think about. I’m placing the object ABC,\non 3 chairs which are in a row.\nI pick the A and I’m gonna place it\nA has 3 possible places to be. So let’s say, I put the A\nnow, I’m gonna put. The B\nB has only 2 places left.\nSo it’s 3 times the 2,\nand the last one is only one possible place to remain. It has no freedom, actually.\nSo that’s 3 times 2 times one. This is exactly the 6 that we have obtained here.\nIf I have an object, and I do the same thing.\nI have to do N. Times, N, minus one N, minus 2 all the way up to one.\nAnd this thing, this number has a name.\nIt’s called N Factorial N Factorial. It’s the product of all the numbers between one and N integers.\nOkay, let’s get more complicated.\nI’m going to have these 2 people or 2 objects, and I’m going to place them not on 2 chairs on N chairs.\nso the A can be placed in N positions.\nOnce this is done, we have N minus one position for B.\nSo the number of ways to arrange 2\ndistinguishable. Why do I mark distinguishable Boldface? Because A and B. There are 2 different letters\nin N positions is N. Times, n, minus one.\nWhat if these 2 objects are 2 blue balls?\nI cannot tell who is one and who is 2 anymore, right? They look identical.\nIn other words, I can flip them.\nand it’s still the same result.\nSo I get that it’s N times, n, minus one divided by 2,\nso if I have 2 objects, I divide by 2.\nBut what if I had k object?\nThe number of ways I shuffle the K object is K factorials, right?\nBecause what does it mean to arrange them? I have to put them on K chairs.\nSo it’s K for the 1st times k, minus one times k, minus 2, etc, etc.\nSo the number of ways to put\nokay, indistinguishable objects or end chairs.\nAnd if you check carefully, it’s the same as N factorial, divided by the product\nof K factorial and N minus K factorial.\nThis number is very important. It’s denoted also by a bracket, as you can see here\nwe read it. N, choose. K. That’s how you read it.\nNow let’s do a tournament problem.\nI have\na tournament I’m going to, and I know that my probability of winning a single game is P.\nI want to know what’s the probability to win exactly K. Games out of the N.\nWell, so we’ll do it.\nP. To the power. K.\nIs the probability to win K. Games.\nBut since I want to win exactly K games, I must also lose all the rest, because otherwise it’s not gonna be K,\nso I’m winning K, and I’m losing K minus one and and minus K.\nSo this is the probability of\nwinning K. Losing and minus K, but which Kate\ngames out of the end do I actually worn and lost?\nWell, I have to choose the K games that I want.\nAnd this is this additional product here.\nIn other words, let’s say I’m doing 3 games out of 10,\nwhich are the 3 games. Is it? One to 3, or one to 5, or one to what?\nIn order to see how many possible combination are there.\nIt’s exactly this number and choose. K,\nokay, so if I look at this formula, which you just did.\nif any small, it looks like this. If it’s getting bigger, it looks like that.\nAnd when it goes to infinity.\nit looks like this. It’s this famous bell-shaped formula.\nOkay, when we deal with random variables are continuous.\nwe don’t talk about the probability to get exactly a number like, what’s the probability for X being equal to 60\nwhat we do. Instead, we look at the range. What’s the probability to get between 60 and 70?\nAnd this question now becomes something that has a meaning.\nNow we come to the most important theorem in this particular lecture, and it’s called the central limit theorem.\nSo what is but what’s this limit theory about?\nWe are doing some experiment.\nThe result of these experiments is summarized in a random variable. X\nx 1 is the result of the 1st experiment x 2 is the second experiment, and so on.\nFor example, X can be the result of tossing the die 0, or one\nor one to 6. I mean, if it’s a coin, it’s 0 or one, if it’s a die, it’s 1 to 6, for example.\nSo I do it again and again. Again. I do it actually n times.\nand can be a hundred. For example, while I have only 2 sides to flip.\nI calculate the average result of this 100 times.\nI call it S.\nNow I do it again and again, and again, and again and again, I have a lot of results for us.\nI can make a histogram out of this result.\nHow will this histogram look like? If N is not.\nIt’s gonna look like the shape you see right here.\na shape that has an interesting formula given here, and\nthis shape depends on 2 parameters, Mu and Sigma\nmule is the place where the sand. It’s the center of this shape.\nlet’s say, muse a hundred. It’s gonna center at the point 100\nsigma has to do with the weights, so\nyou can see the result of different sigmas in the picture at the bottom. Small Sigma. It’s more peaked and more narrow, high Sigma.\neverything smears out more.\nMu is called the mean, and Sigma called the Standard Deviation. Okay.\nNow, one of your homework.\nI mean, it cannot be for tomorrow. So you do it for the next week.\nOkay.\nyou want to write a python code to simulate the Clt. The central limit theory, and I’ll I’ll give more precise things about it later in a few minutes.\nnormal distribution, some properties of the normal distribution. If I look at the mu.\nand then I make an interval mu minus sigma to mu plus sigma.\nand I see what’s the area under the curve. Between these limits\nI get 0 point 6 8, almost 70%.\nBut if I go not one sigma, 2 sigmas up and down.\nI get 95% off.\nMy area is between mu minus 2 sigma and mu plus 2 sigma.\nSo these numbers are very important.\nHere is an example where I calculate expected value.\nExpected value is some theoretical number.\nIt is a sum of x times, p. Of x. Over all possible values of x.\nFor example, let’s do the tossing. The die has 2, 6 sides.\nEach one has a probability, one over 6,\nso I do one times one over 6 plus 2 times one over 6 plus 3 times one over 6 all the way up to 6, and I get 3.5.\nSimilarly, if I want to do the prob, the expectation of X squared.\nSo now think about this. You replace X here\nwith X squared, and also here.\nSo it will be the sum of X squared times, p. Of X,\nso I just plug it in. And I get, you know, 15 point something. And the variance is this formula\nwhere I get something around 3.\nThis is an interesting problem. Again, you can think about a simulation to do it. Okay.\nyou take a stick of unit length, break it at random.\nLet Y be the length of the longer piece.\nWhat is the mean of this? Why.\nso you randomly choose it, and then you take average. This will be the mean for this\npoor district. And here there is some assignment I mean, not an assignment, some recommendation. If you have time.\nyou know, do it by python.\nOkay, now we have 2 assignments. Okay, which is not for tomorrow, but the following week\none is called the Central Limit theorem.\nand the other one is called\nthe birthday problem. Okay? So I’m gonna go over each, all of them\nfor the central imagery. You want to verify that you get really the normal distribution.\nSo what you do is this.\n1st you pick a random variable.\nWhat do you pick coin, flip? It’s only 0 and one\ndiatosing one up to 6, or some to some other number, uniform distribution between 0, and\nso I would probably do the diet tossing with\n6, or maybe not 6, but 5 or other numbers.\nYou’re going to generate random numbers from this N times.\nThen calculate the average.\nthen calculate Z, so Z, I’m gonna give you it in a formula, right? And then do histogram of Z, basically.\nSo let’s go over this slide.\nThis is the math behind it, the central limit theorem.\nAnd again, since we are meeting also tomorrow.\nI don’t have to rush with this. I will actually store, I mean redo this next time\ntomorrow, same time, so that you are more ready for the homework.\nBut overall, what do what do I want to do?\nThere are a few quantities to calculate. x. 1 up to Xn. These are the results of your experiment. You flip the coin, meaning randomly. Pick a number between one to 6 and do it again and again and again.\nand write your things, one x, 1 x, 2 x, 3, etcetera.\nThen you calculate the average of it. This is X bar.\nThen you calculate the n, or if you want, you calculate this\nsquare root of what of Xn bar minus mu\ndivide by Sn, where Sn is given by this formula.\nSo in this formula everything is known.\nx, 1, x, 2 up to xn is known, and also the average is known. So Sn is known.\nMu is the only thing which is not known. You have to know it theoretically.\nbut you know it’s an easy task.\nSo calculating. Z. Really means calculating this quantity.\nSo what is the homework about? Let’s go back.\nYou do a histogram of DC.\nIn other words, you calculate it again and again and again. Do do histogram. And you want to see that you get the normal 0. 1 distribution\nin the birthday problem break it into 2.\nYou have a class of N. Students who assume that their birthday are uniformly distributed over the year N is specified. Let’s say 20.\nYou randomly pick birthday for 20 people, and you check. Is there a duplication meaning? Are there\nany 2 people with the same birthday?\nSo you do it again and again, and you really get the probability\nthat the class has 2 students having the same birthday.\nSo this is number one. Given n.\nCalculate the probability, the number 2\nyou have to check. For what value of n.\nThe probability to have 2 students with the same birthday?\nFor what kind of size of class this probability is 0 point 5.\nSo this is a perfect place to stop.\nWe can continue tomorrow I will do a little bit more of this and a little bit of statistics.\nand then we’re gonna go to machine learning.\nOkay? So I hope you have enjoyed this.\nI’m gonna try to fix my camera. But\nI think the laptop is beginning to run into troubles.\nOkay? So I’m gonna see you tomorrow same time, and we’ll continue with more exciting stuff.\nBye, bye, everyone bye, thanks.\n"},"03_resources/What-every-computer-science-major-should-know":{"title":"What every computer science major should know","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe article outlines a comprehensive curriculum for computer science majors, emphasizing skills and knowledge crucial for securing employment, ensuring lifelong career relevance, pursuing graduate studies, and contributing to society.

Key areas covered include data structures, algorithms, theoretical computer science, computer architecture, operating systems, networking, security, cryptography, software testing, user experience design, data visualization, parallelism, software engineering, formal methods, graphics, robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and databases. The core message is that a modern CS education must be hands-on, conceptually rigorous, and continually adapting to the evolving technological landscape.\nKey Points\n\nPortfolio over Resume: Students should build a public portfolio (e.g., GitHub, blog) to showcase projects and code, as direct evidence of ability.\nTechnical Communication: Master presentation tools (Keynote), LaTeX for documentation, and communicate ideas clearly to diverse audiences.\nEngineering Core: Solid foundation in real analysis, linear algebra, probability, statistics, multivariate calculus, and physics.\nUnix Philosophy &amp; Systems Administration: Fluency in command-line tools, shell scripting, text-file configuration, and the ability to install, configure, and troubleshoot Linux systems, web servers, and network services.\nProgramming Languages: Learn multiple paradigms (e.g., Racket, C, JavaScript, Squeak, Java, Standard ML, Prolog, Scala, Haskell, C++, Assembly) and understand core semantic concepts; ideally, implement an interpreter/compiler.\nDiscrete Mathematics: Strong grasp of formal logic, proof techniques (induction), and discrete structures (trees, graphs, formal languages, automata), with enough number theory for cryptography.\nData Structures &amp; Algorithms: Know common structures (hash tables, trees, graphs) and algorithm design strategies (greedy, dynamic programming); be able to implement both imperative and functional versions.\nTheory: Understand models of computation (Turing machines, lambda calculus, undecidability) and computational complexity (P, NP, NP-Hard, NP-Complete).\nArchitecture &amp; Operating Systems: Comprehend computer architecture from transistors to caches, including GPU models, and how kernels handle system calls, memory, and scheduling; hands-on experience with kernel modifications.\nNetworking: Firm understanding of the network stack, routing protocols, and protocol design trade-offs (e.g., TCP vs. UDP); implement network clients/servers.\nSecurity &amp; Cryptography: Awareness of common vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, code injection) and defensive programming; understand and implement core cryptographic concepts (symmetric/public-key, hashes, digital signatures).\nSoftware Testing &amp; Engineering: Integrate testing throughout the curriculum (e.g., peer-graded test cases); master version control (Git, SVN) and debugging tools (GDB, Valgrind); practice team software construction.\nUser Experience Design &amp; Visualization: Understand principles of UX/UI to create user-friendly software and effectively visualize data as information.\nParallelism: Deep knowledge of multi-core architecture; learn parallel programming paradigms (CUDA, OpenCL, Pthreads, MPI) and concepts like map-reduce.\nFormal Methods: Be at least moderately comfortable using a theorem prover to promote rigorous coding style.\nGraphics &amp; Simulation: Teaches clever programming and optimization techniques (e.g., ray tracing, 3D projections).\nRobotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning: Engaging ways to teach programming and understand the practical applications of AI, particularly machine learning fundamentals (Bayesian networks, clustering).\n\n\nmatt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/\nOriginal Content\nPortfolio versus resume\nHaving emerged from engineering and mathematics, computer science programs take a resume-based approach to hiring off their graduates.\nA resume says nothing of a programmer’s ability.\nEvery computer science major should build a portfolio.\nA portfolio could be as simple as a personal blog, with a post for each project or accomplishment. A better portfolio would include per-project pages, and publicly browsable code (hosted perhaps on github or Google code).\nContributions to open source should be linked and documented.\nA code portfolio allows employers to directly judge ability.\nGPAs and resumes do not.\nProfessors should design course projects to impress on portfolios, and students, at the conclusion of each course, should take time to update them.\nExamples\n\nEdward Yang’s web site.\nMichael Bradshaw’s web site.\nGithub is my resume.\n\nTechnical communication\nLone wolves in computer science are an endangered species.\nModern computer scientists must practice persuasively and clearly communicating their ideas to non-programmers.\nIn smaller companies, whether or not a programmer can communicate her ideas to management may make the difference between the company’s success and failure.\nUnfortunately, this is not something fixed with the addition of a single class (although a solid course in technical communication doesn’t hurt).\nMore classes need to provide students the opportunity to present their work and defend their ideas with oral presentations.\nSpecific recommendations\nI would recommend that students master a presentation tool like PowerPoint or (my favorite) Keynote. (Sorry, as much as I love them, LaTeX-based presentation tools are just too static.)\nFor producing beautiful mathematical documentation, LaTeX has no equal. All written assignments in technical courses should be submitted in LaTeX.\nRecommended reading\n\nWriting for Computer Science by Zobel.\nEven a Geek Can Speak by Asher.\nThe LaTeX Companion.\nThe TeXbook by Knuth. (Warning: Experts only.)\nNotes on Mathematical Writing.\nSimon Peyton-Jones’s advice on How to Give a Good Research Talk.\nMy advice on how to send and reply to email.\n\nAn engineering core\nComputer science is not quite engineering.\nBut, it’s close enough.\nComputer scientists will find themselves working with engineers.\nComputer scientists and traditional engineers need to speak the same language—a language rooted in real analysis, linear algebra, probability and physics.\nComputer scientists ought to take physics through electromagnetism.

In interpreting results, there is no substitute for a solid understanding of statistics.\nRecommended reading\n\nCalculus by Spivak.\nAll of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference by Wasserman.\n\nThe Unix philosophy\nComputer scientists should be comfortable with and practiced in the Unix philosophy of computing.\nThe Unix philosophy (as opposed to Unix itself) is one that emphasizes linguistic abstraction and composition in order to effect computation.\nIn practice, this means becoming comfortable with the notion of command-line computing, text-file configuration and IDE-less software development.\nSpecific recommendations\nGiven the prevalence of Unix systems, computer scientists today should be fluent in basic Unix, including the ability to:\n\nnavigate and manipulate the filesystem;\ncompose processes with pipes;\ncomfortably edit a file with emacs and vim;\ncreate, modify and execute a Makefile for a software project;\nwrite simple shell scripts.\n\nStudents will reject the Unix philosophy unless they understand its power. Thus, it’s best to challenge students to complete useful tasks for which Unix has a comparative advantage, such as:\n\nFind the five folders in a given directory consuming the most space.\nReport duplicate MP3s (by file contents, not file name) on a computer.\nTake a list of names whose first and last names have been lower-cased, and properly recapitalize them.\nFind all words in English that have x as their second letter, and n as their second-to-last.\nDirectly route your microphone input over the network to another computer’s speaker.\nReplace all spaces in a filename with underscore for a given directory.\nReport the last ten errant accesses to the web server coming from a specific IP address.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nThe Unix Programming Environment by Kernighan and Pike.\nThe Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook by Kerrisk.\nUnix Power Tools by Powers, Peek, O’Reilly and Loukides.\ncommandlinefu.\nLinux Server Hacks.\nThe single Unix specification.\n\nSystems administration\nSome computer scientists sneer at systems administration as an “IT” task.\nThe thinking is that a computer scientist can teach herself how to do anything a technician can do.\nThis is true. (In theory.)\nYet this attitude is misguided: computer scientists must be able to competently and securely administer their own systems and networks.\nMany tasks in software development are most efficiently executed without passing through a systems administrator.\nSpecific recommendations\nEvery modern computer scientist should be able to:\n\nInstall and administer a Linux distribution.\nConfigure and compile the Linux kernel.\nTroubleshoot a connection with dig, ping and traceroute.\nCompile and configure a web server like apache.\nCompile and configure a DNS daemon like bind.\nMaintain a web site with a text editor.\nCut and crimp a network cable.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nUNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook by Nemeth, Synder, Hein and Whaley.\n\nProgramming languages\nProgramming languages rise and fall with the solar cycle.\nA programmer’s career should not.\nWhile it is important to teach languages relevant to employers, it is equally important that students learn how to teach themselves new languages.\nThe best way to learn how to learn progamming languages is to learn multiple programming languages and programming paradigms.\nThe difficulty of learning the n th language is half the difficulty of the (n-1)th.\nYet, to truly understand programming languages, one must implement one. Ideally, every computer science major would take a compilers class. At a minimum, every computer science major should implement an interpreter.\nSpecific languages\nThe following languages provide a reasonable mixture of paradigms and practical applications:\n\nRacket;\nC;\nJavaScript;\nSqueak;\nJava;\nStandard ML;\nProlog;\nScala;\nHaskell;\nC++; and\nAssembly.\n\nRacket\nRacket, as a full-featured dialect of Lisp, has an aggressively simple syntax.\nFor a small fraction of students, this syntax is an impediment.\nTo be blunt, if these students have a fundamental mental barrier to accepting an alien syntactic regime even temporarily, they lack the mental dexterity to survive a career in computer science.\nRacket’s powerful macro system and facilities for higher-order programming thoroughly erase the line between data and code.\nIf taught correctly, Lisp liberates.\nRecommended reading\n\nHow to Design Programs by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and Krishnamurthi.\nThe Racket Docs.\n\nANSI C\nC is a terse and unforgiving abstraction of silicon.\nC remains without rival in programming embedded systems.\nLearning C imparts a deep understanding of the dominant von Neumann architecture in a way that no other language can.\nGiven the intimate role poor C programming plays in the prevalence of the buffer overflow security vulnerabilities, it is critical that programmers learn how to program C properly.\nRecommended reading\n\nANSI C by Kernighan and Ritchie.\n\nJavaScript\nJavaScript is a good representative of the semantic model popular in dynamic, higher-order languages such as Python, Ruby and Perl.\nAs the native language of the web, its pragmatic advantages are unique.\nRecommended reading\n\nJavaScript: The Definitive Guide by Flanagan.\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Crockford.\nEffective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript by Herman.\n\nSqueak\nSqueak is a modern dialect of Smalltalk, purest of object-oriented languages.\nIt imparts the essence of “object-oriented.”\nRecommended reading\n\nIntroductions to Squeak\n\nJava\nJava will remain popular for too long to ignore it.\nRecommended reading\n\nEffective Java by Bloch.\n\nStandard ML\nStandard ML is a clean embodiment of the Hindley-Milner system.\nThe Hindley-Milner type system is one of the greatest (yet least-known) achievements in modern computing.\nThough exponential in complexity, type inference in Hindley-Milner is always fast for programs of human interest.\nThe type system is rich enough to allow the expression of complex structural invariants.

Proof by algebraic manipulation and by natural deduction engages the reasoning common to routine programming tasks. Proof by induction engages the reasoning used in the construction of recursive functions.\nComputer scientists must be fluent in formal mathematical notation, and in reasoning rigorously about the basic discrete structures: sets, tuples, sequences, functions and power sets.\nSpecific recommendations\nFor computer scientists, it’s important to cover reasoning about:\n\ntrees;\ngraphs;\nformal languages; and\nautomata.\n\nStudents should learn enough number theory to study and implement common cryptographic protocols.\nRecommended reading\n\nHow to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Velleman.\nHow To Solve It by Polya.\n\nData structures and algorithms\nStudents should certainly see the common (or rare yet unreasonably effective) data structures and algorithms.\nBut, more important than knowing a specific algorithm or data structure (which is usually easy enough to look up), computer scientists must understand how to design algorithms (e.g., greedy, dynamic strategies) and how to span the gap between an algorithm in the ideal and the nitty-gritty of its implementation.\nSpecific recommendations\nAt a minimum, computer scientists seeking stable long-run employment should know all of the following:\n\nhash tables;\nlinked lists;\ntrees;\nbinary search trees; and\ndirected and undirected graphs.\n\nComputer scientists should be ready to implement or extend an algorithm that operates on these data structures, including the ability to search for an element, to add an element and to remove an element.\nFor completeness, computer scientists should know both the imperative and functional versions of each algorithm.\nRecommended reading\n\nCLRS.\nAny of the Art of Computer Programming series by Knuth.\n\nTheory\nA grasp of theory is a prerequisite to research in graduate school.\nTheory is invaluable when it provides hard boundaries on a problem (or when it provides a means of circumventing what initially appear to be hard boundaries).\nComputational complexity can legitimately claim to be one of the few truly predictive theories in all of computer “science.”\nA computer scientist must know where the boundaries of tractability and computability lie. To ignore these limits invites frustration in the best case, and failure in the worst.\nSpecific recommendations\nAt the undergraduate level, theory should cover at least models of computation and computational complexity.\nModels of computation should cover finite-state automata, regular languages (and regular expressions), pushdown automata, context-free languages, formal grammars, Turing machines, the lambda calculus, and undecidability.\nAt the undergraduate level, students should learn at least enough complexity to understand the difference between P, NP, NP-Hard and NP-Complete.\nTo avoid leaving the wrong impression, students should solve a few large problems in NP by reduction to SAT and the use of modern SAT solvers.\nRecommended reading\n\nIntroduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser.\nComputational Complexity by Papadimitriou.\nAlgorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne.\nIntroduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.\n\nArchitecture\nThere is no substitute for a solid understanding of computer architecture.\nComputer scientists should understand a computer from the transistors up.\nThe understanding of architecture should encompass the standard levels of abstraction: transistors, gates, adders, muxes, flip flops, ALUs, control units, caches and RAM.\nAn understanding of the GPU model of high-performance computing will be important for the foreseeable future.\nSpecific recommendations\nA good understanding of caches, buses and hardware memory management is essential to achieving good performance on modern systems.\nTo get a good grasp of machine architecture, students should design and simulate a small CPU.\nRecommended reading\n\nnand2tetris, which constructs a computer from the ground up.\nComputer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy.\n“What every programmer should know about memory” by Drepper.\n\nOperating systems\nAny sufficiently large program eventually becomes an operating system.\nAs such, computer scientists should be aware of how kernels handle system calls, paging, scheduling, context-switching, filesystems and internal resource management.\nA good understanding of operating systems is secondary only to an understanding of compilers and architecture for achieving performance.\nUnderstanding operating systems (which I would interpret liberally to include runtime systems) becomes especially important when programming an embedded system without one.\nSpecific recommendations\nIt’s important for students to get their hands dirty on a real operating system. With Linux and virtualization, this is easier than ever before.\nTo get a better understanding of the kernel, students could:\n\nprint “hello world” during the boot process;\ndesign their own scheduler;\nmodify the page-handling policy; and\ncreate their own filesystem.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nLinux Kernel Development by Love.\n\nNetworking\nGiven the ubiquity of networks, computer scientists should have a firm understanding of the network stack and routing protocols within a network.\nThe mechanics of building an efficient, reliable transmission protocol (like TCP) on top of an unreliable transmission protocol (like IP) should not be magic to a computer scientist. It should be core knowledge.\nComputer scientists must understand the trade-offs involved in protocol design—for example, when to choose TCP and when to choose UDP. (Programmers need to understand the larger social implications for congestion should they use UDP at large scales as well.)\nSpecific recommendations\nGiven the frequency with which the modern programmer encounters network programming, it’s helpful to know the protocols for existing standards, such as:\n\n802.3 and 802.11;\nIPv4 and IPv6; and\nDNS, SMTP and HTTP.\n\nComputer scientists should understand exponential back off in packet collision resolution and the additive-increase multiplicative-decrease mechanism involved in congestion control.\nEvery computer scientist should implement the following:\n\nan HTTP client and daemon;\na DNS resolver and server; and\na command-line SMTP mailer.\n\nNo student should ever pass an intro neworking class without sniffing their instructor’s Google query off wireshark.\nIt’s probably going too far to require all students to implement a reliable transmission protocol from scratch atop IP, but I can say that it was a personally transformative experience for me as a student.\nRecommended reading\n\nUnix Network Programming by Stevens, Fenner and Rudoff.\n\nSecurity\nThe sad truth of security is that the majority of security vulnerabilities come from sloppy programming. The sadder truth is that many schools do a poor job of training programmers to secure their code.\nComputer scientists must be aware of the means by which a program can be compromised.\nThey need to develop a sense of defensive programming—a mind for thinking about how their own code might be attacked.\nSecurity is the kind of training that is best distributed throughout the entire curriculum: each discipline should warn students of its native vulnerabilities.\nSpecific recommendations\nAt a minimum, every computer scientist needs to understand:\n\nsocial engineering;\nbuffer overflows;\ninteger overflow;\ncode injection vulnerabilities;\nrace conditions; and\nprivilege confusion.\n\nA few readers have pointed out that computer scientists also need to be aware of basic IT security measures, such how to choose legitimately good passwords and how to properly configure a firewall with iptables.\nRecommended reading\n\nMetasploit: The Penetration Tester’s Guide by Kennedy, O’Gorman, Kearns and Aharoni.\nSecurity Engineering by Anderson.\n\nCryptography\nCryptography is what makes much of our digital lives possible.\nComputer scientists should understand and be able to implement the following concepts, as well as the common pitfalls in doing so:\n\nsymmetric-key cryptosystems;\npublic-key cryptosystems;\nsecure hash functions;\nchallenge-response authentication;\ndigital signature algorithms; and\nthreshold cryptosystems.\n\nSince it’s a common fault in implementations of cryptosystems, every computer scientist should know how to acquire a sufficiently random number for the task at hand.\nAt the very least, as nearly every data breach has shown, computer scientists need to know how to salt and hash passwords for storage.\nSpecific recommendations\nEvery computer scientist should have the pleasure of breaking ciphertext using pre-modern cryptosystems with hand-rolled statistical tools.\nRSA is easy enough to implement that everyone should do it.\nEvery student should create their own digital certificate and set up https in apache. (It’s surprisingly arduous to do this.)\nStudent should also write a console web client that connects over SSL.\nAs strictly practical matters, computer scientists should know how to use GPG; how to use public-key authentication for ssh; and how to encrypt a directory or a hard disk.\nRecommended reading\n\nCryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno.\n\nSoftware testing\nSoftware testing must be distributed throughout the entire curriculum.\nA course on software engineering can cover the basic styles of testing, but there’s no substitute for practicing the art.\nStudents should be graded on the test cases they turn in.\nI use test cases turned in by students against all other students.\nStudents don’t seem to care much about developing defensive test cases, but they unleash hell when it comes to sandbagging their classmates.\nUser experience design\nProgrammers too often write software for other programmers, or worse, for themselves.\nUser interface design (or more broadly, user experience design) might be the most underappreciated aspect of computer science.\nThere’s a misconception, even among professors, that user experience is a “soft” skill that can’t be taught.\nIn reality, modern user experience design is anchored in empirically-wrought principles from human factors engineering and industrial design.\nIf nothing else, computer scientists should know that interfaces need to make the ease of executing any task proportional to the frequency of the task multiplied by its importance.\nAs a practicality, every programmer should be comfortable with designing usable web interfaces in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nRecommended reading\n\nPaul Graham’s essay on Web 2.0.\n“The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets” by Spolsky.\nHTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Duckett.\nJavaScript: The Definitive Guide by Flanagan.\n\nVisualization\nGood visualization is about rendering data in such a fashion that humans perceive it as information.

Lots of practice.\nSpecific recommendations\nIt is not at all clear what the “final” answer on parallel programming is, but a few domain-specific solutions have emerged.\nFor now, students should learn CUDA and OpenCL.\nThreads are a flimsy abstraction for parallelism, particularly when caches and cache coherency are involved. But, threads are popular and tricky, so worth learning. Pthreads is a reasonably portable threads library to learn.\nFor anyone interested in large-scale parallelism, MPI is a prerequisite.\nOn the principles side, it does seem that map-reduce is enduring.\nSoftware engineering\nThe principles in software engineering change about as fast as the programming languages do.\nA good, hands-on course in the practice of team software construction provides a working knowledge of the pitfalls inherent in the endeavor.\nIt’s been recommended by several readers that students break up into teams of three, with the role of leader rotating through three different projects.\nLearning how to attack and maneuver through a large existing codebase is a skill most programmers will have to master, and it’s one best learned in school instead of on the job.\nSpecific recommendations\nAll students need to understand centralized version control systems like svn and distributed version control systems like git.\nA working knowlege of debugging tools like gdb and valgrind goes a long way when they finally become necessary.\nRecommended reading\n\nVersion Control by Example by Sink.\n\nFormal methods\nAs the demands on secure, reliable software increase, formal methods may one day end up as the only means for delivering it.\nAt present, formal modeling and verification of software remains challenging, but progress in the field is steady: it gets easier every year.\nThere may even come a day within the lifetime of today’s computer science majors where formal software construction is an expected skill.\nEvery computer scientist should be at least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover. (I don’t think it matters which one.)\nLearning to use a theorem prover immediately impacts coding style.\nFor example, one feels instinctively allergic to writing a match or switch statement that doesn’t cover all possibilities.\nAnd, when writing recursive functions, users of theorem provers have a strong urge to eliminate ill-foundedness.\nRecommended reading\n\nSoftware Foundations.\n\nGraphics and simulation\nThere is no discipline more dominated by “clever” than graphics.\nThe field is driven toward, even defined by, the “good enough.”\nAs such, there is no better way to teach clever programming or a solid appreciation of optimizing effort than graphics and simulation.\nOver half of the coding hacks I’ve learned came from my study of graphics.\nSpecific recommendations\nSimple ray tracers can be constructed in under 100 lines of code.\nIt’s good mental hygiene to work out the transformations necessary to perform a perspective 3D projection in a wireframe 3D engine.\nData structures like BSP trees and algorithms like z-buffer rendering are great examples of clever design.\nIn graphics and simulation, there are many more.\nRecommended reading\n\nMathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics by Lengyel.\n\nRobotics\nRobotics may be one of the most engaging ways to teach introductory programming.\nMoreover, as the cost of robotics continues to fall, thresholds are being passed which will enable a personal robotics revolution.\nFor those that can program, unimaginable degrees of personal physical automation are on the horizon.\nRelated posts\n\nMultitouch gesture control for a robot.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nIf for no other reason than its outsized impact on the early history of computing, computer scientists should study artificial intelligence.\nWhile the original dream of intelligent machines seems far off, artificial intelligence spurred a number of practical fields, such as machine learning, data mining and natural language processing.\nRecommended reading\n\nArtificial Intelligence by Russell and Norvig.\n\nMachine learning\nAside from its outstanding technical merits, the sheer number of job openings for “relevance engineer,” indicates that every computer scientist should grasp the fundamentals of machine learning.\nMachine learning doubly emphasizes the need for an understanding of probability and statistics.\nSpecific recommendations\nAt the undergraduate level, core concepts should include Bayesian networks, clustering and decision-tree learning.\nRecommended reading\n\nMachine Learning by Mitchell.\n\nDatabases\nDatabases are too common and too useful to ignore.\nIt’s useful to understand the fundamental data structures and algorithms that power a database engine, since programmers often enough reimplement a database system within a larger software system.\nRelational algebra and relational calculus stand out as exceptional success stories in sub-Turing models of computation.\nUnlike UML modeling, ER modeling seems to be a reasonable mechanism for visualing encoding the design of and constraints upon a software artifact.\nSpecific recommendations\nA computer scientist that can set up and operate a LAMP stack is one good idea and a lot of hard work away from running their own company.\nRecommended reading\n\nSQL and Relational Theory by Date.\n\nNon-specific reading recommendations\n\nGödel, Escher, Bach by Hofstadter.\nNick Black’s advice for MS students.\n\nWhat else?\nMy suggestions are limited by blind spots in my own knowledge.\nWhat have I not listed here that should be included?\nRelated posts\n\nHOWTO: Get tenure\nParsing BibTeX into S-Expressions, JSON, XML and BibTeX\nPAANDA: An NDA for academics\nCollege tips, tricks and hacks\nTips for defending a Ph.D.\nHOWTO: Respond to peer reviews\n12 resolutions for grad students\nHOWTO: Peer review scientific work\nElectric meat\nPeer fortress: The scientific battlefield\nThe shape of your problem\n6 tips for low-cost academic blogging\nThe illustrated guide to a Ph.D.\nThe CRAPL: An open source license for academia\nWhy peer reviewers should use TOR\nAcademic job hunt advice\n\n"},"03_resources/What-is-Natural-Language-Processing-(NLP)-A-Beginner’s-Guide":{"title":"What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

While AI encompasses a broad range of technologies that allow machines to simulate human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, NLP deals with linguistic elements. The main difference lies in their scope: AI is the broader discipline that aims to create intelligent machines, and NLP is a specialized area within AI dedicated to bridging the gap between human communication and computer understanding.\nDo search engines like Google use NLP?\nYes, search engines like Google use NLP extensively to understand and process user queries, as well as to index and retrieve web content more effectively. NLP allows these search engines to grasp the context of words in search queries, improving the accuracy of search results.\nDoes ChatGPT use NLP?\nYes, ChatGPT uses advanced NLP technologies to understand and generate human-like text responses. It’s built on models that analyze vast amounts of text data, learning patterns and nuances of language to simulate natural conversation.\nWhat are the ethical considerations in using NLP?\nHow do multilingual and dialect-specific challenges affect NLP?\nHandling multiple languages and dialects increases the complexity of NLP solutions, requiring more sophisticated models that can understand and adapt to linguistic diversity.\nWhat role does NLP play in emotional AI or sentiment analysis?\nNLP is central to emotional AI and affective computing, enabling machines to understand and respond to human emotions conveyed through text or speech, which is widely used in customer service and social media monitoring.\nTopics\nStart Your NLP Journey Today!\nTrack\nNatural Language Processing in Python\n0 min\nLearn how to transcribe, and extract exciting insights from books, review sites, and online articles with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.\nCourse\nIntroduction to Natural Language Processing in Python\n4 hr\n133.8K\nLearn fundamental natural language processing techniques using Python and how to apply them to extract insights from real-world text data.\nCourse\nAdvanced NLP with spaCy\n5 hr\n21K\nLearn how to use spaCy to build advanced natural language understanding systems, using both rule-based and machine learning approaches.\n[\nSee More\n](www.datacamp.com/courses-all)\nRelated\nHow to Learn NLP From Scratch in 2025: An Expert Guide\nblog\nView original\nIn this guide, you’ll discover how to learn Natural Language Processing (NLP) from scratch.

The essay breaks down this ability into three core components: seeing one’s own biases and influence (\\“reflection in the window\\”), discerning a person’s unconscious drives and true behaviors over stated intentions (\\“elephants in the room\\”), and recognizing the profound impact of context and environment on individual performance (\\“the water\\”). Duncan asserts that in-person reference checks are significantly more valuable than interviews for gaining this clarity. He also shares his experiences with various personality assessment tools and provides practical interview and reference questions, aiming to help others make more accurate and insightful judgments about potential hires, partners, or even themselves.\nKey Points\n\nCore Skill: The most critical skill for team building and decision-making is understanding \\“what’s going on here, with this human?\\” (candidate selection, business partners, etc.).\nThree Pillars of Clear Seeing:\n\nSeeing your Reflection in the Window: Self-awareness and understanding one’s own biases and impact on interactions. Personality assessments (Myers-Briggs, Big Five) can aid this.\nSeeing the Elephants in the Room: Recognizing a person’s unconscious drives and actual behaviors (\\“theory in use\\”) over espoused theories. Reference checks are 5-10x more valuable than interviews for this.\nSeeing the Water: Understanding the context/ecosystem; a person’s performance is highly dependent on their environment, and strengths in one context can be weaknesses in another.\n\n\nValue of References: References are paramount for gaining clear insight, often revealing information unobtainable in interviews. Seek \\“Yoda references\\” (unbiased, calibrated, clear-eyed).\nInterview Mindset: Approach interviews with humility and \\“negative capability\\” (willingness to delay knowing), aiming to find the best fit for the candidate, not just a binary \\“A player\\” judgment.\nKey Attributes: Look for resourcefulness, and for team players, \\“humble, hungry, and smart\\” (as defined by Lencioni).\nPersonality Assessments: Various tools like Big Five/OCEAN, ghSMART, and Kegan’s adult development stages can provide useful frameworks for understanding people, but no single framework is perfect.\nPractical Advice: Includes specific questions for both reference checks and interviews designed to elicit deeper insights into a person’s character and capabilities.\n\n\ngrahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/\nOriginal Content\nThe philosopher Kwame Appiah writes that “in life, the challenge is not so much to figure out how best to play the game; the challenge is to figure out what game you’re playing.”\nWhen I try to figure out what game I’m playing, I see that for the last 25 years I have been playing a game of strategy applied to people, a game where over and over I try to answer the question “what’s going on here, with this human?” In this essay, I make recommendations about candidate selection based on thousands of assessments I have made and my somewhat obsessive interest in the topic.\nMy goal in this essay is to help others make better decisions on a potential hire, business partner, or even life partner as quickly and as accurately as possible. It’s made up of suggested action steps and some of the ruminations that underlie them. At the end I include my own assessment of different personality assessments and some of my go-to interview and reference questions.\nJerry Seinfeld once said, when asked how he felt about aging, “I think if you’re a little lucky in life you should enjoy getting older…when you’re young you can’t see what’s going on so well. You get older, you walk into a room and you see who people are faster.”\nToward the end of his life, Steve Jobs told Walter Isaacson, “If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony Ive. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in…he gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product.” Let’s say that the way Jobs and Ive knew each other—quirks, strengths, weaknesses—after 14 years of daily conversation was a 10.\nHow close to that 10 can you get when you’re first getting to know someone and deciding whether they are a fit for your team?\nWhen I started making those sorts of judgments about people, I’d guess my average was a 3. I’ve since done thousands of interviews, spent just as many hours talking to references, and helped hire hundreds of people—as consultants for a research firm that I helped run right after college, and since then as analysts and investors in my role investing large pools of capital. Now, when I’m in the zone and the conditions are right, I think I can sometimes get to a 7.\nA lot of people, in my industry and others, see all of this as a drag, a distraction from the central mission of their team. But I’ve come to consider it the most important skill for anyone building teams—and to believe that, to the extent I have any unique skill, this is it. In the work context, managing the complexity around people is the most important skill for anyone building a business. As the gaming company Valve puts it: “Hiring well is the most important thing in the universe.”\n\nThis view of hiring as a key business skill is new. It was not true of industrial companies (U.S. Steel, Dow Chemicals), but complex intellectual endeavors like SpaceX are on a new playing field. Or consider the U.S. Army of WWII versus the Navy SEALs of today: the battlefield is even more complex, so selecting for the most talented players gives an organization even more leverage than in the past.\nAfter reading a large number of business school case studies, a friend of UCLA business strategy professor Richard Rumelt observed to him that “‘it looks to me as if there is really only one question you’re asking in each case: What’s going on here?’” Rumelt writes: “it was something I’ve never heard said explicitly but it was instantly and obviously correct. A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.”\nIt can be useful, when interviewing someone, to take Rumelt’s cue and ask explicitly: what’s going on here with this person in front of me? The more I’ve done it, the more I realize that what most people think of as the hard parts of hiring—asking just the right question that catches the candidate off guard, defining the role correctly, assessing the person’s skills—are less important than a more basic task: how do you see someone, including yourself, clearly?\nSeeing people clearly—or at least more clearly—matters not just when finding the “best” hire, but in identifying the best role for them. Even looking at those of us who are lucky enough to have a high degree of choice about what we do with our work, I’ll bet that as few as 20% of us are in the seat that best optimizes our talents and skills at any given time—the seat that makes us feel at home in the world. That’s not good for the 80%, and it’s not good for their teams either.\nThe poet David Whyte describes the unfolding of life and career as a “conversation with reality”:\n\nWhatever a human being desires for themselves will not come about exactly as they first imagined it or first laid it out in their minds…what always happens is the meeting between what you desire from your world and what the world desires of you. It’s this frontier where you overhear yourself and you overhear the world.\nAnd that frontier is the only place where things are real…in which you just try to keep an integrity and groundedness while keeping your eyes and your voice dedicated toward the horizon that you’re going to, or the horizon in another person you’re meeting.\n\nWhyte captures how hiring can be an art form. When you see people clearly, you see the transcript of their conversation with reality up until that moment of your meeting, and you glimpse the horizon that stretches out ahead of them. And then sometimes you can help them overhear themselves and overhear what the world wants from them, whether or not that includes working in the role that you had initially imagined for them.\nThere are three parts to expanding your ability to see people more clearly: seeing your own reflection in the window, seeing the elephants in the room, and seeing the water.\nPart I: Seeing your Reflection in the Window\nIn his book Waking Up, Sam Harris offers a great metaphor for seeing through frames:\n\nImagine that you want to show another person how a window can also function like a mirror. As it happens, your friend has never seen this effect and is quite skeptical of your claims. You direct her attention to the largest window in your house, and although the conditions are perfect for seeing her reflection, she immediately becomes captivated by the world outside. What a beautiful view! Who are your neighbors? Is that a redwood or a Douglas fir? You begin to speak about there being two views and about the fact that your friend’s reflection stands before her even now, but she notices only that the neighbor’s dog has slipped out the front door and is now dashing down the sidewalk. In every moment, it is clear to you that your friend is staring directly through the image of her face without seeing it.\n\nHow do you convey that there’s an aspect of the window that is also a mirror? As Harris says, it’s actually really hard.\nBut you really can’t see another person clearly unless you can first see yourself clearly: both of you are together creating the interaction you are in. If you’re holding your breath while you speak, you may cause the other person to hold their breath and then you might experience them as nervous. If your question implies a value you place in competitiveness, that part of them may come forward in the answer in a way that would not in other settings.\nIf I picture my thirty-year-old self doing an interview, I see him as the friend looking through the window: not seeing the way his mind was constantly making snap judgments about the candidate, creating stories with the slightest bit of material, “I like this,” “I don’t like that.” He would project his reality onto the reality of the other person, missing that, for instance, often even very senior people are not their usual selves in a formal interview setting, that there’s a power dynamic that he should not take lightly. He would not yet be aware that while his sensitivity to being hustled is a gift, it also creates a blind spot that causes him to mistakenly pass on a particularly good sales person or someone who is earlier in their career and still relies on jargon or cliché.\nOne way that I’ve tried to help myself see the reflections in the window is by using personality assessments. I’ve taken well over thirty different personality assessments over the years to try to glimpse my own strengths and weaknesses and to try to see other people more clearly.\nLike many people, my first experience was with Myers–Briggs—I tend to test as an INTP—but I I’ve used everything from the “Big Five” or OCEAN (Open-minded, Conscientious, Extroverted, Agreeable, Neurotic), to ghSMART questions (“when I call your former manager, how will they rate your performance on a scale of 1-100?”), to former Bain consultant Patrick Lencioni’s idea of “humble, hungry and smart” as the attributes of an ideal team player. There are also more philosophical systems, such as Bob Kegan’s framework of adult development, and the Enneagram, that require more up-front time investment. (At the bottom of this piece I discuss my experience with different assessment tools.) I recommend using more than one, to avoid becoming stuck seeing through just one framework.\nPart II: Seeing the Elephants in the Room\nSeeing others clearly is about tuning into a process, a way of seeing. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s metaphor is good. Visualize yourself riding a huge elephant while you interview someone riding a second huge elephant (Haidt apparently came to this metaphor of rider and elephant during a psychedelic trip.) Haidt advises imagining your conscious mind as the rider and your unconscious drives as the elephant—powerful and willful and ultimately inclined to take the rider where the elephant wants to go most of the time. The key insight is that the rider is not always a reliable witness about the elephant they ride.\n \nSo let’s reframe the interview process: there are two elephants in the room, yours and that of the person you’re trying to see. The bad news is that you’re mostly blind to both elephants. The good news is that there are a lot of other riders who’ve traveled alongside the other rider and elephant. If you take your perspective on the rider and your glimpses of his or her elephant, and add everyone else’s experience of the rider and their elephant, and then control a bit for your own elephant and the references’ own elephants, you can get a good sense of how the candidate’s rider-elephant combination behaves.\nThere is a difference between what Chris Argyris called “espoused theory” (what someone says when they are interviewed) versus their “theory in use” (the mental models that actually drive their actions in daily life). Note that Argyris was not making the obvious distinction between someone’s theory and action, but instead the distinction between espoused theory and actual theory in use. Interviewing the rider is useful, but you have to keep in mind that in the warp and woof of day-to-day reality, the various “espoused theories” from the rider more often give way to the “theories in use” of the elephant.\nQuestions like “what are you compulsive about?” can sometimes reveal the other person’s elephant. Or: “Where have you experienced a moment of ignition, when you saw some older person doing an activity and you intuited that they were wired the same way you were, and you said to yourself ‘I want to be that’?” Or: “How would your spouse/sibling/parent describe you with ten adjectives?” If the candidate is capable of taking someone else’s perspective and willing to convey it (which happens roughly 50% of the time, more often in older candidates), then the adjectives tend to help you see both rider and elephant.\nDuring interviews, I try to create a stillness that helps separate signal from noise, elephants from riders. The easiest way to create conditions of stillness is to talk very little. It also helps to have the candidate you’re trying to see clearly ask you questions. Questions have very high signal value compared to most anything else you can get from a candidate. This is harder to do in practice than you might think—you need to make the candidate feel safe enough to ask their true questions, and you need to answer concisely or you’ll run out of time (which is particularly hard if the person asks good questions). I write down each question and sometimes respond with “I’ll answer, but first I’m curious, why did you ask that?” I’m looking for the felt sense of a “hungry mind” based on the way their questions flow. That’s very hard to fake.\nTry to unburden the interview of too many assumptions you have about the role. I like asking up-front, “So what criteria would you use if you were the one hiring someone for this role?” I love this question because of how unexpected the answers are. Some are tactical when you expect abstraction. Some improve your own criteria. Some use jargon that may indicate they are playing someone else’s game versus authoring their own. All are quite revealing.\nWhile you may be able to catch glimpses of the elephant in your meeting, it’s important to remember that you’re basically blind. Most of the time, it will be more effective and efficient to speak to other people who know how that elephant and rider go together—their shared “theory in use”—and who have experienced the combination in action, ideally over a large number of iterations over a long time (the way their spouse or sibling knows them).\nAn in-person interview is only one input, and not necessarily the most valuable one. Relying on my own impression of people has at times worked out okay, but I’ve found that maintaining humility about one’s own ability to see someone clearly during a one- or two-hour interview in a contrived setting is harder than I thought at first.\nBefore an interview, I sometimes re-read this great passage from Philip Roth’s American Pastoral:\n\nYou might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you’re anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you’re with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception.\n\nI now consider in-person references with someone who knows the candidate well 5x more valuable than an interview. They can be 10x more valuable when you are already in a high-trust relationship with the reference-giver, and the reference-giver is in a position to see the candidate clearly, with no agendas and few blind spots of their own.\nGiven the importance of references, the highest purpose of your own interview with a candidate might be to improve your ability to conduct reference interviews, where you hold your own view as just one in a collection of views. This requires an ability to hold multiple perspectives at once, a state of partial knowing that the poet John Keats called “ negative capability ”—in one author’s definition, “the innocence from agendas that enables one to become like what one observes rather than impose the self upon it, the patient and lingering curiosity, the willingness to wait and delay knowing, that allows a person to reach into the different reality than his or her own.” This is difficult to do because your own impressions from the interview are so vivid and multi-sensory, and everyone else’s views are mainly conveyed through language.\nIn my experience, holding your own perspective alongside those of references should feel slightly uncomfortable and disorienting, or you’re doing it wrong. You should find the candidate confusing at times. If you first see their dysfunction, you should know you have yet to find their genius, and vice versa.\nI try to conduct references with an eye to quirky forms of excellence. When I’m on the receiving end of reference calls, I notice that the caller is often subtly framing the exercise with a mildly suspicious “gotcha” vibe (“so why did George leave after only two years?”). I don’t find that particularly effective; it tends to make me shut down as a reference giver. Instead, when I’m calling someone, I try to imagine myself as head of people operations for the entire hedge fund or private equity ecosystem, that I’m agnostic as to where they should sit and just trying to help them get to the best spot. That mindset seems to allow me to size up people more generously and accurately, and to accommodate more quirkiness.\nAs your sample size of references goes up, you can begin to calibrate on the credibility of the reference giver (what’s their sample size? What are their biases?) as well as to tune into what a “table-pounding” reference sounds like. Fourteen years later I still remember a reference I did for our CFO hire: the woman who had worked with him had a tone of “why are you wasting your time talking to me and not spending your time trying to convince him to join you?” She felt slightly sorry for me that I didn’t get it yet. I’ve listened for that tone ever since on other references, and in the rare moments I hear it, it’s always proven to be high signal.\nThe hardest part is understanding the dog that doesn’t bark. If you don’t hear that table pounding from someone who knows the reference well, is it contextual in some way (the person is tired, you caught them right after a tough conversation, they are jealous, etc.) or is there signal there? It’s one element of the process that requires the 10,000 hours of practice to get calibrated.\nI also try to stick to the default assumption that “everyone is an A player at something.” It’s a more effective and more dynamic way to approach an interview—a live, fascinating puzzle to discover what the elephant and the rider do well—rather than going in with the purpose of determining whether someone is an A player in a binary, Manichean way. I prefer to imagine that I’m trying to find the candidate the best possible job for them; it may be the job I had in mind, or something else altogether.\nPart III: Seeing the Water\nIn 2005, David Foster Wallace delivered what has become a famous commencement speech at Kenyon College. He started it with a joke about two young fish who are swimming along and encounter an older, wiser fish. “Hey boys, how’s the water?” the older fish asks. The junior fish don’t reply, but a minute later one turns to the other and asks, “What the heck is water?”\nIt’s really hard to see the water in your own local ecosystem, and only slightly easier to see the water in someone else’s. Context matters. I used to assume I could identify a core set of attributes that would work across ecosystems. But although people are wired in certain ways that make them consistent across contexts, they are in other ways extremely sensitive to context.\nI sometimes visualize meeting one person as the equivalent of meeting the Ocean’s 11 crew together at once, wrapped up in one human envelope—we each have distinct parts, and we tell a story to ourselves and the world that they are a coherent whole, but depending on the context different parts step forward into the light on the stage. (To read more on “parts” theory, see Internal Family Systems.)\nI now believe that there is no such thing as an A player in the abstract, across all time, in whatever ecosystem they end up in. The former head of recruiting at Bridgewater, Jeff Hunter, has a great essay in which he points out that former head of Apple stores Ron Johnson was an “A player” by any definition in Steve World (he was on the short list to succeed Jobs), but became a “C player” after Bill Ackman and his partners made Johnson head of JCPenney (where he was summarily fired after a poor performance).\nWhen you’re taking someone from one ecosystem to another, changing their context, you have to try to see the water in both. It’s disruptive and risky to take someone out of the setting in which they’re thriving, since there are a lot of subtle things going on in the original that may not be immediately obvious. How much of their success depends on the water in the first ecosystem? Was there someone there who believed in them that set a positive feedback loop in motion that may not persist across systems? Try to understand as much as possible about “what’s going on here” in the candidate’s prior ecosystem. For instance in the investment management context, often a portfolio manager will run a large idea by their boss and subtle reactions (a raised eyebrow, a long pause) will cause them to actually size the position smaller. That constant tension is constructive, and if you take the portfolio manager out of that container they will not perform in the same way in the absence of the tension.\nThis particularly applies to people who leave to start their own companies—in part because they may have a hard time recreating the culture and context that allowed them to thrive when they worked in a structure designed by someone else. (I discussed this transition in my Letter to a friend who may start a new investment platform.)\nIt’s even possible that strengths in one context become weaknesses in another. The Enneagram personality system stresses that each “type,” a term to describe one of nine ego patterns, has a gift, but tends to get into trouble when it leans too much into this gift. Take someone who is super motivated and who loves to win, but because of this competitiveness doesn’t give as much as they get from peers. In one ecosystem they develop a reputation as a talented “taker” that people are wary of, while in another they are celebrated without reservation.\nOne marker that I’m seeing someone clearly is when I understand how their strengths are also their weaknesses, how their genius lives right next to their dysfunction. I know that I’m further away from clarity when I am overly excited or overly skeptical.\nDifferent ecosystems have different aesthetics, and you want to tune in to someone’s prior aesthetic context if you plan to change it. A subtle but important element of context is whether the members of a team believe in each other. I’ve been in contexts where my boss believed in me, and contexts where they didn’t. I performed well in the former, badly in the latter. If you’re the player, try to hold out for the coach who appears capable of believing in you. You can often intuit that based on how the current team talks about that manager; former team members are likely even higher signal. And if you’re the manager, try to only hire people you can genuinely imagine believing in, where you can perceive their particular flame of genius and stoke it.\nOne of the greatest gifts we have for each other, for our children and spouses, for our teammates, is the positive feedback loop we can put someone into purely by believing in them, by seeing their genius and their dysfunction clearly and then helping them construct conditions for the former to flourish.\nASSESSING THE ASSESSMENTS\nMyers–Briggs\nLike many people, my first exposure to personality assessments was Myers–Briggs, a tool that friends who worked at McKinsey were obsessed with as they tried to understand why some people work well together on teams and some don’t click. Supposedly around 80% of McKinsey’s staff are one profile, ENTJ, and Myers–Briggs gives everyone a framework for understanding why other patterns are trickier to manage.\nI tend to test as an “ INTP.” Everyone now understands the usefulness of introversion versus extroversion. The difference between the “P” (extreme comfort with uncertainty) vs. colleagues and romantic partners who are “J” (a tendency to nail things down, to be decisive and minimize uncertainty) has also been useful at times. When I interview people I also sometimes notice the “S” (sensing) tendency to be super literal and concrete, in good and bad ways, versus the more abstract “N” (intuition). I think it’s particularly useful to track S vs. N between yourself and someone you work for or who works for you, because communication difficulties may boil down to that dimension, and it’s useful to have a vocabulary for the tension.\nHigh vs Low Self-Monitors\nA second assessment tool came from a friend who worked at McKinsey. She got my attention when she said the only thing she’d learned at Harvard Business School was the distinction between high self-monitors—people who adjust to their audience, and are thus high flexibility, lower integrity—and low self-monitors—people who in good and bad ways don’t adjust to their audience and are thus high integrity, lower flexibility.\nI’m a high self-monitor, and I started noticing that many couples consist of a high self-monitor and a low self-monitor. Two high self-monitors can find themselves constantly adjusting to each other, and it’s exhausting. Two low self-monitors are slightly hard to seat next to each other at a dinner party; they need a guide for the social world, and often implicitly require the other person to come to them a bit.\nBig Five or OCEAN\nWhen I started East Rock 15 years ago, my mission was to find and invest with the most talented investors in the world. I got a piece of advice from a psychology professor who said that I should check out the “Big Five” or OCEAN (Open-minded, Conscientious, Extroverted, Agreeable, Neurotic) Big Five aspect scale. I got distracted and found my way back to the Big Five over 4,000 interviews later; I found it a revelation to help explain the patterns I had soaked up along the way. In retrospect, maybe I needed the large sample size to be able to see how useful the Big Five actually is in describing the nuance of how people behave in real life.\nEach personality system has an origin story, and the Big Five’s is particularly credible. Two professors took every word in the English language that could be used to describe someone, put them into categories, and reduced them to as small a set of factors as they could. For instance, if lots of people agreed they could call someone both gregarious and outgoing, the researchers decided that was the same thing; they kept reducing that down until they got extraversion as a primary factor.\nFor high open-minded picture Leonardo Da Vinci\nFor high conscientious picture Robo-cop\nFor high extraverted picture Bill Clinton and high introverted picture Barack Obama\nFor low neuroticism picture the Dude from the Big Lebowski or the stereotypical Californian\nFor high neuroticism picture Woody Allen\nResearchers later identified that the Big Five could be reduced to the “big two,” stability and plasticity. Or double click on the big Five and you have the “big ten.” Here’s a great overview of the facets:\n\nThere are thousands of studies using the Big Five. Within psychology it’s the equivalent of gravity, and at this point nearly everyone in academia finds it a useful mental model for personality. Sam Barondes’ book Making Sense of People is a great introduction to the Big Five. I tracked down Sam and asked him about the book’s raison d’être. He told me that he wrote it because he knew the Big Five was solid as science but had noticed that, in his own hiring in the medical department at UCSF as well as among the fancy tech CEOs he counseled, no one was actually using it in practice.\nghSMART\nTen years ago, I read Geoff Smart’s book Who and then hired one of his partners at their assessment firm ghSMART to “Smart” me (a four-hour structured interview) so that I could be on the receiving end of the process and understand it better. Then I had lunch with Geoff, and he somehow managed to grok me within five minutes, hypnotizing me into answering a rapid series of questions with a very upbeat attitude and smile.\nSignature ghSMART questions include the aggressive and efficient question of “what are the names of your last five bosses (stop and write each name down) and when I call them for a reference on you, how would they each rate you on a 1-100 for overall performance?” Interviewers go through each year or phase of your life and capture high points and low points. It sounds easy; it’s not, which is why I assume ghSMART shares all their IP surprisingly freely. If you’re a board member or private equity investor who is hiring someone that is senior and expensive, so the stakes are high and you’re in a hurry, my view is that it’s smart to pay for the services of ghSMART.\nPulling the Geoff Smart thread also led me to his father, Brad Smart, who had run a lot of hiring for GE under Jack Welch. Brad’s book Topgrading inspires much of Geoff’s work. In this short blog piece, Brad argues that “resourcefulness” is the meta competency:\nResourcefulness is the single most important competency, so here’s my advice: look for evidence of Resourcefulness 100% of the time as you evaluate candidates. Imagine that you have special magical glasses that register through the lens whether the candidate is, at this moment, revealing Resourcefulness and maybe then it flashes green, or lack of Resourcefulness and maybe then it flashes red. I’m making the point that Resourcefulness is not a competency you first think of after the interview while you’re reviewing your notes. You must constantly ask yourself, “Does that example, what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling, what I’m hearing, show Resourcefulness, or lack of it?”\nI sometimes imagine I’ve dropped the candidate I’m interviewing on a desert island and I come back five years later. Some people I’d worry about, some people I wouldn’t. The Y Combinator application question “what’s a system or game you’ve hacked in the last year?” is a good arrow in the quiver when exploring the resourcefulness dimension.\n“Humble, hungry and smart”\nAnother framework I use specifically in the context of hiring for a well-functioning team is former Bain consultant Patrick Lencioni’s idea of “humble, hungry and smart” as the core virtues of the “ideal team player.” Lencioni defines “smart” as “smart about people,” and he notes that if you sacrifice any of these essential three virtues, you are introducing friction into your team. I find his framework quite useful for understanding trade-offs around team dynamics. The book The Ideal Team Player is a great quick read, or you can watch this TED talk or listen to this podcast.\nThree other frameworks that are often used in a corporate context are Caliper,Insights Discovery, and Workplace Dimensions. Many hedge funds use Caliper as a personality test for hiring (it also has an IQ component) and end up finding it useful. Vista Private Equity has a strategy of buying software businesses and then firing the more expensive, senior software sales people and hiring younger, cheaper ones using Insights Discovery’s ability to successfully identify good sales people (Insights Discovery is based on Jungian archetypes). Ray Dalio and his team at Bridgewater swear by Workplace Dimensions as a way to make sure each small team is balanced and effective across four dimensions: Creator, Refiner, Executer, Advancer.\nI suspect that each of these systems captures roughly 80% of the reality about people, and the important step for teams is to pick one, invest the time in making the vocabulary resonate, and then use it to discuss communication in the team and make hires.\nBob Kegan and the Enneagram\nThere are two more philosophical systems—Bob Kegan’s adult development scale and the Enneagram—that I frequently try to apply, but they both require big time investments up front in attending workshops and soaking up the vocabulary, so just reading about them can be off-putting and not super useful. I’ll mention both briefly in case people want to investigate further.\nIn 2011, I took a workshop at the Harvard School of Education to learn how to assess people’s stage of development using Kegan’s Subject Object Interview. Kegan argues that there are five distinct stages of adult development; the last three are the “socialized” stage (around 60% adults are in this stage), the “self-authoring” stage (roughly 30% of American adults), and finally the self-transforming stage (less than 1% of adults). He writes:\nHaving a socialized mind dramatically influences the sending and receiving of information at work. If this is the level of mental complexity through which I view the world, then what I send will be strongly influenced by what I believe others want to hear.\nContrast this with the self-authoring mind. If I view the world from this level of mental complexity, what I “send” is more likely to be a function of what I deem others need to hear to best further the agenda or mission of my design. Consciously or unconsciously, I have a direction, an agenda, a stance, a strategy, an analysis of what is needed, a prior context from which my communication arises. The self-authoring mind creates a filter for what it will allow to come through. It places a priority on receiving the information it has sought. Information I haven’t asked for, and which does not have obvious relevance to my own design for action, has a much tougher time making it through my filter.\nThe self-transforming mind both values and is wary about any one stance, analysis, or agenda. It is mindful that, powerful though a given design might be, this design almost inevitably leaves something out. It is aware that it lives in time and that the world is in motion, and what might have made sense today may not make as much sense tomorrow. Therefore, when communicating, people with self-transforming minds are not only advancing their agenda and design, they are also inquiring about the design itself. Information sending is not just on behalf of driving; it is also to remake the map or reset the direction.\nI find Kegan’s framework useful to understand someone’s transition from a role player to an “owner.” I spoke with a former portfolio manager who told an interesting story about his own development. At his former firm, he had been doing well and was surprised when a colleague got a ton more money and responsibility. He was feeling frustrated needing to have the CIO sign off on the positions in his book. The CIO would hem and haw, say he was going to call his friend to see what he thought, etc. Another colleague counseled him, “You’re not owning it. You see this as your job and you try and if it doesn’t work to get one of your positions in the portfolio, oh well. It’s your responsibility to figure out the CIO and what his lens is and convince him to put something in the book.” My friend said that single piece of advice changed his life. Through the Kegan lens, he made a rapid phase shift from “socialized” to “self-authoring.”\nI often return to Bill Torbert’s Global Leadership Profile as a good working articulation of the Kegan levels.\nIn 2015, I read Jim Dethmer’s book The Fifteen Commitments of Conscious Leadership and brought him to speak at two hedge fund conferences I had convened. Jim and his partners at the Conscious Leadership Group use the Enneagram a lot in their coaching. The Enneagram is more a tool for personal and spiritual growth than a personality framework per se. I bounced off the Enneagram for the first several years of exposure to it through working with Jim as a coach, finding it obtuse at best and astrological at worst.\nBut over time, I’ve come to appreciate how the patterns seem to hold up oddly well across my sample of people. I particularly like how each of the nine personality types holds the paradox of the gift of that type right next to a profound blind spot for that type. At first I thought my own dominant ego pattern was the 7 pattern (“the enthusiast”), now I think it’s more likely a 3 (“the performer”). I don’t particularly feel the need to resolve which I am, and like having both patterns clear in my mind so that I can be more likely to recognize when I’m in that particular personality groove.\nRuss Hudson is one of the preeminent Enneagram thinkers, and his podcast with Shane Parrish is a good place to start. For people who want to go down this particular rabbit hole, I recommend one of Russ’s workshops. It’s hard to see your own pattern at first, so I suggest keeping a parent or significant other in mind as you read the book to see whether you find the framework credible in how it describes someone you know well.\nThe risk of becoming too steeped in any one framework is you start to be “subject” to that framework, you can only look through its lens, not at the lens. I recommend trying to hold a handful of frameworks in your mind simultaneously in order to maintain flexibility.\nREFERENCE GUIDE\nThis is a short note I wrote to myself and a teammate that we re-read before starting a reference process on someone.\n\nThere are two kinds of information: public information and private information. Our personal assessments of our peers and former employees are firmly in the bucket of private information. That’s both what makes references valuable, and what makes them hard to get.\nYour mission is to collect as many private assessments on your candidate as possible.\nRemind yourself that your base case is that you will not proceed with the candidate despite the fact you’re at the stage of doing references. You want to create a default mindset that listening to the references is going to actively make you change your mind to make the hire. “Let the references speak” is our mantra.\nFor each candidate there is often one reference that is the motherlode, the Yoda reference—the unbiased, calibrated, no bullshit, clear-eyed reference, someone with “acerbic good taste” who has experienced your candidate with limited ego baggage of their own and is willing to transfer that private information to you. Sometimes you get them on the first call, sometimes it’s on the 20th call. Have you found that reference giver yet? If not and the context permits, do not proceed with the hire, allow yourself to hold the uncertainty.\nAssess whether the reference giver is calibrated—what’s their sample size and do they actually know what excellence in this role is? (Assume 80% of people are not calibrated on the Michael Jordan of this thing.)\nAssess whether you find the reference givers themselves credible. Identify any biases. Would you hire the reference givers or want to work for them? If not, make sure you weight the content of the reference slightly lower.\nTry to mess with the expected “script” of a reference conversation, where the reference giver reads a LinkedIn testimonial and you read from a check-list of questions. Skim the questions below in advance in order to have them in mind, but try not to read from the list because it creates a different dynamic, more interrogation and less creative exploration and appreciation of someone’s idiosyncrasies.\nThe dog that doesn’t bark is the hardest thing to assess and requires calibration / a big sample size —what could they say on the positive side but are not saying?\nDo references in person if you can, Zoom is second best, phone is third best.\nStart with an opener that makes it safe to convey private information: “Thanks for taking the time. I’m trying to find the right seat for Jane and I’m investing the time in speaking to people who know her. Everything you say will be off the record, and I don’t plan on conveying any of it back to Jane.”\n\nReference Questions\n\nHow would you describe Jane to someone who doesn’t know her?\nWhat’s your sample size of people in the role in which you knew Jane?\nWho was the best person at this role that you’ve ever seen?\nIf we call that person a “100”, the gold standard, where’s Jane right now on a 1-100?\nDoes she remind you of anyone else you know?\nIf Jane’s number comes up on your caller ID, what does your brain anticipate she’s going to be calling about? What’s the feeling?\nThree attributes I like to keep in mind are someone’s hunger, their humility, and how smart they are about people. If you were to force rank those for Jane from what she exhibits the most to least, how would you rank them?\nWhat motivates Jane at this stage of her life?\nIf you were coaching Jane, how would you help her take her game up?\nIf you were going to hire someone to complement Jane doing the same activity (NOT a different role), what would they be good at to offset Jane’s strengths and weaknesses?\nHow strong is your endorsement of Jane on a 1-10? (If they answer 7, say actually sorry 7s are not allowed, 6 or 8? If the answer is an 8, “What is in that two points?”)\n\nINTERVIEW GUIDE\n\nRemember that your mission is primarily to get to know the person well enough to do effective reference checks\nCan you glimpse the person’s elephant as distinct from the rider, who is speaking to you?\nCan you establish enough safety to allow the frame of “how can I help you find the best job for you in the world?” instead of “are you an A player, are you a fit for this role?”\nInterrupt often to establish a fast cadence and avoid monologues\n\nQuestions for the candidate\n\nWhat criteria would you use to hire someone to do this job if you were in my seat?\nHow would your spouse or sibling describe you with ten adjectives?\nI think we’re aligned in wanting this to be a good fit, you don’t want us to counsel you out in six months and neither do we. Let’s take the perspective of ourselves in six months and it didn’t work. What’s your best guess of what was going on that made it not work?\nWhat are the names of your last five managers, and how would they each rate your overall performance on a 1-100?\nWhat are you most torn about right now in your professional life?\nHow did you prepare for this interview?\nHow do you feel this interview is going?\n"},"03_resources/Why-the-Best-Startups-Are-Obsessed-With-Customer-Feedback":{"title":"Why the Best Startups Are Obsessed With Customer Feedback","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThis article explains why customer feedback is crucial for startups, highlighting its role in understanding customer needs, refining products, building loyalty, identifying opportunities, improving user experience, and fostering a customer-centric culture.

Early stage startups usually comprise a lean but hard-working team dedicated to building out their product — and often, creating opportunities to talk to their users can fall lower on their list of priorities at a time when urgent bugs and funding issues are commonplace. But collecting feedback from customers can lead to valuable insights and significant growth opportunities. Read on to learn how your startup can start better understanding your customers, develop a customer feedback management system and feedback loop, identify new opportunities for growth and customer acquisition, improve user experience, and build a loyal customer base.\nWhile tech startup teams usually do quite a bit of research and testing before launching their business, they often lack the full breadth of data they need for effective feedback management to strategize for the future of their product and company. A prototype product that does well with an initial test group, for instance, may not generate enough interest or sales after launch if it lacks a feature deemed necessary for one demographic of prospective customers. Such discrepancies can make for a rocky start to the business.\nTo address these issues early and head on, startup teams can prioritize collecting feedback from their customers and creating a feedback management strategy. By analyzing the feature requests they receive in the first months after launching a product, the team can gain a better understanding of how their customers are using their product, what pain points are significantly impacting more of their customers, and how specific workflows are panning out in real life. When your team has an idea of what your customers need, you can create a better informed product roadmap that addresses those needs.\nTo collect feedback that helps your team better understand your customers’ needs and preferences, try:\n\nAsking for feature requests. Customers’ ideas for improving your product can often point you toward gaps or friction points in your product and show you more clearly how your customers want to be using your product. You can collect feature requests via surveys, phone calls and in-person meetings with customers, or directly within your product interface.\nUsing behavior tracking tools. Heatmaps and tools that record how users typically use your product can be invaluable to startup teams. These solutions can help you pinpoint ineffective workflows and bugs by showing you exactly what your customers do with your product.\nCreating a customer advisory board. Most companies do this when they’re already well out of startup territory, but an advisory board doesn’t have to include multiple industries or Fortune 500 companies to give valuable feedback. Gather the champions from a handful of your biggest or most active customers, meet with them regularly, and ask them how you’re doing and how you could do better.\n\n\nFor most software startups, the product they launch with is peanuts compared to what it evolves into a year or two down the road — and this evolution is often key to the startup’s success as a company. Teams can launch their product with a strong development strategy in mind, but unless that strategy is flexible enough to accommodate emerging market trends, inevitable delays and roadblocks, and —most importantly — customer needs, the startup can struggle to grow.\nTo ensure that your startup is positioned for success in those critical first years, your team will need to prioritize collecting data about:\n\nThe customer journey. Study how each customer begins using your product, what workflows they use most often, and any “hacks” they use to get your product to work better for them. Keeping tabs on how your customers use your software can help you better identify what to change.\nFeatures and opportunities. Collecting ideas for improving your software from those who use it can point your team towards gaps and opportunities that were previously unknown.\nBugs and pain points. This is a no-brainer: fixing the things that bother your customers or make it harder for them to use your product will make your product better in the long run.\n\nBy collecting and analyzing customer feedback, startups can gather quantitative and qualitative data to inform their product decisions. This data-driven approach allows startups to make more informed, evidence-based choices about product enhancements, feature prioritization, and strategic direction. Over time, this can lead to more successful product iterations and a stronger competitive position in the market.\n\nCustomer feedback enables startups to refine and enhance their products.\nAI startup Ceros enhanced their content editor with features based on customer feedback.\nAccording to recent studies, it costs five times as much for companies to acquire new customers than to retain current customers — and increasing customer retention rates usually translate to increased revenue. While many startups have their sights set on acquiring new customers, keeping their current ones happy and active may actually have far more impact on startup success.\nCreating a loyal customer base is easier said than done, however. You’ll have to:\n\nSet up a reliable system for collecting, analyzing, and addressing customer feedback\nActively solicit and respond to customer feedback to demonstrate your team’s commitment to your users and their evolving needs\nPrioritize your customers’ needs, which can mean occasionally pushing other development projects to fix bugs or add a requested feature\n\nThe payoff can be significant, however: with an established customer feedback loop customers who feel heard and valued are more likely to remain loyal, provide ongoing feedback, and become advocates for the brand, further driving growth and adoption.\n\nfeedback management - Similarweb\nWhen competitive intelligence platform provider Similarweb began collecting customer feedback, they realized that many of their active users needed to go elsewhere to find funding data. In early 2024, the team added this information to the platform, eliminating the pain point.\nWhen the product team at Pepper Content set out to prioritize customer feedback, their goal was to improve user engagement and establish a customer feedback loop. In addition to achieving that goal, however, the team found benefits they weren’t at all expecting — including an opportunity to unlock an entirely new segment of the market. After setting up Beamer Feedback, the team received many feature requests for custom prompts for Peppertype, the company’s AI-powered platform. The team soon realized that these requested prompts were primarily for other businesses. Today, their new B2B offerings generate over $180K in MRR for the company.\nPepper Content’s story is a prime example of the unexpected and lucrative opportunities that can be unearthed from collecting customer feedback and establishing a customer feedback loop. By actively listening to your users’ requests and suggestions, startups can identify opportunities for product innovation and development, new market segments that can be opened by implementing a new feature, a user demographic that they hadn’t previously marketed to, and much more.\n\nPepper Content success metrics\nThe metrics of Pepper Content’s success\nOffering a quality customer experience is usually key to both winning new customers and keeping your current users happy. For the typical scrappy tech startup, however, this can be a challenge: new bugs and various unexpected issues will inevitably emerge, and once your software gets a reputation among your primary audience for being unreliable, it can be difficult to recover from the blow.\nTo stay ahead of the tide, it’s key to keep collecting feedback from your customers. The bugs they report, features they request, and their survey answers on user satisfaction can highlight issues and pain points, sometimes before they cause damage to your brand and product image. By setting aside space in your product roadmap for both solutions to user-reported issues and user-requested features, you’ll ensure that your customers’ experience with your product continually improves.\nSharing a public version of your product roadmap that includes requested features and solutions to user-reported issues will also reassure currently unsatisfied users that their experience with the product will soon improve. Simply showing your customers that you’re prioritizing their needs can go a long way to building goodwill with your users.\nObsessing about customer success is a winning strategy for software companies. For startups, cultivating a customer-first mindset within the organization can have significant benefits, such as a loyal base of early adopters that generates a reliable stream of revenue, a product roadmap that will appeal to new audiences, and positive word of mouth that steadily attracts new customers.\nPrioritizing feedback management and the process of collecting and analyzing customer feedback can help your startup team:\n\nBetter understand your customers. Effective customer feedback management process allows all employees to have access to insights about the real-world challenges, frustrations, and needs of the customer base, this heightened awareness of customers will naturally inform and align the entire team around the user’s point of view.\nBecome more flexible to accommodate customer needs. Proactively seeking and acting on customer feedback instills a responsive and adaptive mindset within the startup. Rather than rigidly executing a pre-determined product roadmap, the team becomes attuned to evolving customer requirements and is empowered to make timely adjustments. This agility and customer-centricity can translate into key competitive advantages for your startup.\nStay accountable for customer success. For customer-centric startups, addressing customer pain points, implementing feedback-driven improvements, and ensuring a consistently great user experience is usually a full-team effort, requiring everyone from engineering to marketing.\nImprove continuously. Prioritizing feedback and creating customer feedback management strategy fosters a mindset of continuous improvement within the startup. The team views customer input not as criticism, but as valuable opportunities to enhance the product and strengthen the company’s relationship with its users. This shared, growth-oriented mindset can cultivate a powerful and driven startup team.\nFoster transparency and open communication. With an established customer feedback management strategy customer insights and experiences are openly shared, discussed, and used to inform decision-making, you can create a transparent, communicative culture that builds trust both internally and externally.\n\n\nPrioritizing customer feedback cultivates a customer-centric culture at your startup.\nFor many startups, setting up a reliable customer feedback management system for collecting and analyzing customer feedback can be challenging — and expensive to do from scratch. Collecting data from surveys, customer conversations and calls, social media, advisory board meetings, and more can also quickly evolve into an onslaught of information that’s difficult to translate into meaningful insights.\n\nBeamer feedback platform\nWith Beamer, you can easily collect customer feedback, enable users to discuss and vote on feature requests, and close your customer feedback loop with changelogs and roadmaps — all without having your users leave your app. By housing customer feedback collection within your app, you can:\n\nKeep all your feature requests in one place\nValidate feature ideas early\nClose the customer feedback loop easily\nShare customer feedback across your team and directly to those who need to act on it\nRespond to requests and questions quickly and build trust\n\nTo learn more, check out Beamer Feedback.\nCheck out this article to learn about 6 ways to improve customer engagement and reduce churn.\nCustomer feedback management refers to the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and acting upon customer feedback to improve products, services, and overall customer experience.

The Purpose of Thinking\nRulkens explains that the main purpose of thinking is not to follow the crowd, but to find better solutions and create value by thinking differently. He encourages questioning the status quo and not simply accepting what everyone else does. \n2. Mental Myopia\nHe discusses “mental myopia,” or the tendency to focus only on what is immediately in front of us. This narrow thinking leads people to make decisions based on what the majority does, rather than considering alternative, potentially better options. \n3. Industry Standards and Mediocrity\nRulkens points out that industry standards are often just averages, and following them means settling for mediocrity. He argues that true innovation and success come from challenging these standards and thinking outside the box. \n4. The Power of Being Different\nHe emphasizes that the most successful people and organizations are those who dare to be different and take calculated risks, rather than simply following the majority.\n5. Practical Application\nRulkens encourages the audience to actively seek out ways to do things differently in their own lives and work, suggesting that this is the path to achieving big goals in the easiest, fastest, and most elegant way possible.\nIn summary, Paul Rulkens’ talk is a call to challenge conventional wisdom, avoid the trap of majority thinking, and pursue unique approaches for greater success.\nPaul Rulkens’ talk centers on the idea that following the majority leads to average, not extraordinary, results. He argues that if you want to achieve something exceptional—whether in business, creativity, or personal growth—you must break away from what everyone else is doing and think outside the box. The majority, by definition, is not extraordinary; it is average. Therefore, practices embraced by the majority will only yield average outcomes.\nKey Points from the Talk \n\nThe Purpose of Thinking: Rulkens explains that thinking is meant to help us find new solutions, not just repeat what’s already been done. Most people, however, default to “automatic pilot,” repeating familiar actions and staying within their comfort zones. ​⁠\nMental Myopia: He describes how people develop tunnel vision, focusing only on what’s immediately in front of them and missing opportunities outside their usual boundaries. ​⁠\nIndustry Standards: Rulkens points out that industry norms are just averages. If you follow them, you’ll get average results. True innovation comes from challenging these standards. ​⁠\nBreaking Out of the Box: He encourages recognizing the boundaries—legal, moral, technological—that shape our thinking, and then deliberately seeking ideas outside those boundaries.\nExtraordinary Results: Only about 3% of people achieve extraordinary results by daring to be different, while the remaining 97% end up working for them.\n\nInsights from the Comments \n\nClarifying the Main Message: Several commenters note that many viewers missed the point: the majority is “always wrong” not in a literal sense, but because the majority is never extraordinary. If you want to build a successful business or life, you can’t just copy what everyone else does—you must innovate and take risks.\nThinking Outside the Box—Explained: Commenters appreciate that Rulkens doesn’t just say “think outside the box,” but actually explains how: by recognizing your boundaries and actively seeking ideas beyond them.\nResilience and Commitment: One comment highlights that having a brilliant idea is just the start. To succeed, you need the passion and resilience to keep going, even when others doubt you or reject your ideas. Many successful people in history faced this challenge.\nReflection and Caution: Some comments reference quotes like Mark Twain’s “When you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect,” reinforcing the talk’s message about questioning conformity.\nNuance and Risk: A thoughtful comment points out that doing things differently doesn’t guarantee success—it can also lead to failure. The key is to be willing to take risks and learn from them, rather than blindly following the crowd.\n\nOverall Takeaway \nThe talk, supported by the comments, is a call to action: if you want to achieve more than average, you must be willing to challenge norms, think differently, and persist in the face of skepticism. The majority’s path leads to mediocrity; extraordinary results require extraordinary thinking and courage."},"03_resources/Willingness-to-pay-Creating-permanent-competitive-advantage-for-the-right-reasons":{"title":"Willingness-to-pay: Creating permanent competitive advantage for the right reasons","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThis article redefines \\“Willingness-to-Pay\\” (WTP) by categorizing customer motivation into three types: Love, Utility, and Coercion. It argues that while traditional economics views all WTP as equal, the source of WTP significantly impacts business strategy and long-term success. WTP derived from \\“Love\\” and \\“Utility\\” fosters genuine customer satisfaction, loyalty, and organic growth, creating a durable competitive advantage. In contrast, WTP based on \\“Coercion\\” leads to adversarial customer relationships, making businesses vulnerable to disruption, even for cold-blooded capitalists.\nKey Points\n\nTraditional economic WTP defines value as the maximum price a customer would pay, leading to \\“Consumer Surplus\\” (WTP minus price) and \\“Profit\\” (price minus cost).\nThe author critiques the word \\“willingness,\\” arguing it often masks coercion (e.g., life-saving drugs, monopolies, lock-in) rather than genuine desire or ability to pay.\nThree types of WTP are introduced:\n\nLove: Driven by mission, reciprocity, exceptional design/quality, personal identification, culture, social/environmental impact, community, and ecosystem. Results in \\“allyship,\\” customer evangelism, and inexpensive, non-linear growth.\nUtility: Driven by practical benefits like low cost, integrations, system-of-record, training, market leadership, convenience, simplicity, risk reduction, and unique functionality. Results in \\“fair exchange of value,\\” retaining existing customers, and neutral-to-positive new customer attraction.\nCoercion: Driven by contract/data lock-in, effective monopolies, price-fixing, bundling, predatory pricing, patents, and corporate/government mandates. Results in an \\“adversarial\\” relationship, customers actively seeking alternatives, and vulnerability to disruption.\n\n\nThe article asserts that creating value through \\“Love\\” and \\“Utility\\” leads to more sustainable, profitable, and valuable businesses than relying on \\“Coercion,\\” even from a purely capitalist perspective.\nThe framework is linked to other business concepts: Kano Model (Delight, Performance, Inverse), Moats (network effects across WTP types), Simon Sinek’s \\“Start with Why,\\” and Blue Ocean Strategy’s buyer utility.\n\n\nlongform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/\nOriginal Content\nby Jason Cohen on May 21, 2023\nThis fresh take on “Willingness-to-Pay” analyzes three types of customer motivation, leading to superior strategies for growth that also better the world.\nsource\nTraditional economics: WTP and Consumer Surplus\nThe best businesses deliver 4 of value, charge 2, and costs them $1 to do it.\nIt’s an obvious formula for both profit and happy customers, but what does “$4 of value” even mean?\nEconomists have labels for this formula:\nFigure 1\nWillingness-to-pay (WTP) is the maximum price the customer would have paid for the product, which the economist claims is how much the customer values the product. “Value” could come from anything⁠—utility, pleasure, status, even irrational confusion. The economist claims that any transaction is evidence that WTP &gt; Price, and the difference between those numbers is “Consumer Surplus.”\nIt looks trivial at a first glance, but I’ve come to believe that analyzing “WTP” is not only non-trivial, but also leads to very different strategies, business models, and outcomes.\n“Willingness” to pay\nI’m irked by this word “willingness.”\nIn 2015, Martin Shkreli, then-CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the rights to the drug Daraprim, which for 62 years had been used to treat a deadly parasitic disease. He raised the price of a pill from 13 to 750,skyrocketing the typical cost of treatment from 1,000 to 63,000.\nsource\nMartin Shkreli testifying before congress on a hearing on drug prices, before calling lawmakers “imbeciles”\n“Profit” was his only justification for this abuse, in his own words:\n\n“I think it will be huge…. So 5,000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000⁠—almost all of it is profit, and I think we will get 3 years of that or more. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us.” ⁠—Martin Shkreli,in communication with investors\n\nPatients have no choice: It’s pay or die. The economist would say, patients objectively have a high “willingness” to pay. But is this how we should define “willing?”\nAnd when patients cannot afford a $63,000 treatment, and therefore don’t purchase the drug, and die, should we say “well, I suppose they weren’t ‘willing’ to pay?” This phrase captures neither the intent nor the ability to pay, both of which are critical factors in questions of price, profit, and consumer surplus.\nWhile there are many 1 such examples, it’s more instructive to point out mundane, non-life-threatening examples of why “willing” is not the right word.\n\n1 There were at least four egregious cases in 2015 alone. More recently, Moderna quadrupled the price of their COVID vaccines, its CEO Stephane Bancel saying that the new price is “consistent with the value” of mRNA vaccines at 45 times the manufacturing cost, after the US government paid them billions to cover the cost of developing the drug. Are we “willing” to pay even more? “Yes” in the sense that human life is valuable, but “no” in the usual sense of the word “willing.”\n\nIt happens with commodities, which economists say are a “perfect market.” When crude oil prices go up, prices at the pump go up immediately, even though costs haven’t yet risen. When crude oil prices go down, prices at the pump go down slowly, even after costs have in fact fallen. The same thing is happening now with eggs. Is that because we’re all “willing” to over-pay for gas and eggs?\nIt happens with bundling⁠— often touted as a wonderful strategy. I never liked paying for cable TV, because it seemed expensive considering I still had to watch ads all the time. Most of the channels I paid for, I didn’t watch. Cable companies know that of course; they bundle channels specifically because they know consumers are not “willing” to pay for all of them. Because the content-owners have a near-monopoly, consumers have no choice. Even with modern streaming services the problem persists, because whether it’s Hulu Live or YouTube TV, it’s still bundled, and still the same price.\nsource\nThere’s also “willing” versus “able.” Perhaps many more consumers would be “willing” to pay 1000 for a fully tricked-out smartphone, but most are not “able.” This is a vital fact when determining strategy, [business models](longform.asmartbear.com/pricing-determines-your-business-model/), and [company viability](longform.asmartbear.com/problem/), but an economist would just say “few consumers are ‘willing’ to pay 1000 for a high-end phone.”\nBut it’s not all bogus. There is a genuine concept of being “willing” to pay more, and thus genuine “Customer Surplus.” I am willing to pay more for Anker products (power strips and chargers) because they’re extremely high-quality; I don’t even notice if there’s a competing product that is 20% cheaper. I’m loyal even though there is neither lock-in nor recurring revenue. People pay more for TOMS 2 and Patagonia 3 products because of their authentic missions. People routinely pay more for coffee that has a fair and sustainable supply-chain, because they’re willing to pay more to have a positive impact on the world, not just to consume the product.\n\n2 Blake Mycoskie was vacationing in Argentina, when a knowledgeable American opened his eyes to the outsized impact that a lack of shoes has on poor children. Unprotected feet are susceptible to punctures and infection, and prohibit walking long distances, which in turn means one cannot go to school. He founded TOMS shoes, selling an Argentinian-style shoe, with the logo of the Argentinian flag, with a marketing strategy he dubbed One for One: Every time you buy a pair of shoes, TOMS would give a pair to a needy child. After TOMS’s financial success, Sketchers copied the strategy exactly, even down to the style of the shoe, the name (“BOBS”), and the altruism. Consumers were so outraged by this inauthentic strategy, Sketchers was forced to canceled the product line after just 24 hours (although they revived the brand later with a different mission). That strategy was individual to TOMS; it was irrelevant that the strategy was publicly visible and copy-able. TOMS has weaknesses⁠⁠— people complain about poor customer service and shoes quickly developing holes⁠⁠—but they win anyway on the strength of the individualized story.\n\n\n3 Besides their publicly-lauded sustainable practices and an outdoor-worshipping culture, they even have a formal company policy to bail employees out of jail if arrested while protesting peacefully.\n\nIndeed, genuine “willingness” creates the best, most durable, most profitable businesses. Consumers not only pay more, they’re happy to pay more, creating profit margin. They become evangelists, driving efficient growth. The company is resilient to competition, because consumers are buying for reasons other than “features” and “price.” The world becomes a better place, transcending a zero-sum game of winners and losers.\nAnalyzing the differences between these kinds of WTP yields insights that all products and companies can leverage to build the best strategies.\nThree kinds of WTP\nI divide WTP into three categories, each having different drivers, and much different strategic value:\nLove\n\nMission: the joy of supporting a change that’s bigger than all of us, or a community or movement you want to see flourish\nReciprocity: when the company gives before taking, or gives more than it takes, or provides exceptional customer service, or is deeply human\nExceptional design: a joy to use, a product that seems to genuinely care about your experience\nExceptional quality: the pleasure and relief generated by reliability\nPersonal identification: leveraging the company’s brand as visible component of your own personal brand\nCulture: supporting an organization that treats employees and vendors well 4\nSocial or environmental impact: supporting sustainable, fair practices\nCommunity: a welcoming space where members learn and teach, support each other, create personal connections, grow their career or business, and be part of a tribe\nEcosystem: wherein all members make more money or gain more prestige than had they not been part of the group\n\nResult: Allyship. Consumers are genuinely happy to do business with you, and root for your success; when you make a profit, they cheer, because they want you to thrive; they advocate for you publicly,5 tying their personal brand with yours; they don’t even consider the competition; the old saying that “people buy from the person they like;” they would be OK with a small price-increase.\n\n4 Counter-example: Walmart and Amazon, known for exploiting workers and suppliers\n\n\n5 This single tweet demonstrates this with thousands of responses.\n\nUtility\n\nCheap: even if quality and functionality is low, it’s better than not having the product\nIntegrations: providing functionality while also more difficult to switch vendors\nSystem-of-record: being the official place for important data, making it risky and expensive to switch vendors\nTraining: invested in having trained an organization, making it expensive and disruptive to switch vendors\nMarket-share Leader: the social-proof of selecting the market-leader is a reason to buy\nLocation: coffee inside the airport is more expensive than on the street corner\nConvenience: groceries delivered to your doorstep are substantially more expensive than getting them yourself\nSimplicity: surprising ease is as delightful as it is useful\nQuality: a seamless experience with no defects is often worth paying for\nRisk-reduction: mitigating potential problems is difficult to measure, but valuable\nUnique functionality: a capability that no competitor can match is a sensible criterium for a purchase decision\nOn-boarding experience:data shows that ease and reciprocity results in higher WTP\nFamiliarity: having used a product or a workflow paradigm for years, it is the comfortable way to work\n\nResult: Fair exchange of value. Your product is useful and not excessively painful; the “devil we know;” getting your money’s worth; easier to stay than to leave, and no particular desire to leave.\nCoercion\n\nContract lock-in: retaining your business through paperwork rather than by choice\nData lock-in: retaining your business by holding your data hostage rather than by choice\nEffective monopoly: being the only feasible option 6\nEffective price-fixing: breaking the so-called “free market”\nMiddle-man: placing yourself in the middle of a transaction, increasing consumer price while decreasing supplier’s profit 7\nBundle-stuffing: combining many things the customer doesn’t want with the few they do want, to charge more in total 8\nScale Anti-Pricing: raising prices once an installation is at-scale, knowing that although an alternative might be more effective, more desirable, and cheaper, the one-time cost of switching is incredibly high\nPredatory Pricing: using lower-than-cost pricing to destroy competitors and ward off investors (funded by another business unit like Amazon does or by VCs as companies like Uber did), then increase prices once the competitive market has been decimated and customers have no choice.\nPatents: abusing a system meant to temporarily protect inventions to block normal competition.\nCorporate policy: once a product is written into a company’s formal policy (site-wide license or the only approved vendor for some application), that product “wins” even if every user hates it\nGovernment fiat or regulation 9\n\nResult: Adversarial. Customers want to leave; they idly comment that they wish some new competitor would arrive and disrupt you; they hate seeing your charges on their bill; they do business with you only begrudgingly; they lobby their boss to switch vendors.\n\n6 This can be constructed purposefully, e.g. Uber spending tens of billions of dollars subsidizing rides to drive rival taxi and ride-share services out of business, so that they are the only option, and can raise prices, as they now have done.\n\n\n7 A classic example is the person who buys a bunch of tickets to a concert, then resells them at 10x the price after the concert is “sold out.” Here’s an even more appalling example.\n\n\n8 There is also a positive version of bundling, in which the items are mostly things the customer does want, purchased at a discount over buying each item individually, possibly with some useful interoperability.\n\n\n9 Here Uber is an example of “love,” breaking the “coercive” stranglehold of taxi industry regulations.\n\nsource\nAll of these things contribute equally to the economist’s definition of WTP: The customer is in fact paying, and might pay more if you raise prices. But strategically they are completely different.\nEffect on growth and competitive pressure\nLove creates inexpensive, non-linear growth, because your customers are your allies.\nYou get repeat purchases, whether it’s a one-time revenue product or a loyal recurring-revenue customer. This creates growth with no additional marketing and sales costs.\nYou get word-of-mouth advocacy. When someone asks what to buy on Twitter, your rabid fans answer the question. When there’s a review site, your product ranks number one. When Customer Surplus is enormous, consumers reciprocate by selling new customers on your behalf.10 Once again, this is growth without additional marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the effect grows as your customer base grows: A non-linear effect.\nWhen a new competitor arrives, even when it is superior in features or price, your customers will stay, because they’re here for more than just the features and the price. This yields retention, which is another form of growth.11 There is a limit to this effect of course⁠—at some point the product simply isn’t good enough⁠—but it carries you through the vacillations of typical competitive one-upmanship.\n\n10 Hollow Knight is a high-quality indie game, made primarily by just three people. Released in 2017, people still make YouTube videos about it in 2023. The soundtrack has millions of listens on Spotify. Everyone says it’s far too cheap at $15. Plus you get 4 expansion packs for free⁠⁠—something games normally charge for. Everyone repeats the story about how it’s just two guys plus one other guy who did the amazing music. Fans even begged them to charge more but they don’t⁠⁠—they’d rather be accessible, and people love them all more for it. The economist would say they should raise prices because they can. Yes they can, but it’s obvious that rabid fans generate millions of purchases, and that financial impact is so much larger than closing the WTP/Price gap to “demonstrate you have market power.”\n\n\n11 Don’t believe me? Look at the growth curve of any startup that went from 7%/mo cancellation to 2%/mo.\n\nUtility grows existing customers, and is neutral-to-positive on attracting new ones.\nAs an organization grows, it will naturally buy more seats of software for teams in customer support, sales, engineering, and so on. It will naturally buy more infrastructure and incur more credit card transaction fees. This isn’t a negative, and does creates internal growth, which is a powerful growth-driver for any business, especially at scale.12\nBut, a customer’s willingness to buy another ten seats of JIRA doesn’t imply the customer is going on forums, spending personal credibility to advocate on your behalf. And it doesn’t mean they won’t take a look at an interesting new competitor.13\n\n12 At scale, new customers can be added only so quickly, whereas you have an enormous existing customer base, so growth inside the base is a larger factor than growth from new customers.\n\n\n13 Indeed, new JIRA competitor Linear has quickly amassed a rabid fan base on the basis of exceptional UX. It’s easy to imagine JIRA users trying Linear and even advocating to switch, whereas it’s laughable to imagine a Linear user trying to convince their team to switch to JIRA.\n\nCoercion causes your customers to be allied with competitors; they’re internally motivated to leave, so they will.\n“Just give me an excuse.” Your customers, locked in against their will, cannot wait for a viable competitor to appear. They will go out of their way to switch, coming up with reasons why investing in the switch will pay for itself ten-fold, despite the cost. Exactly the case you don’t want your customers building.\nWhen your contract is up for renewal, you should be very afraid. When someone asks on Twitter what tool they should use, your customers say: “Well we use X, but don’t make the same mistake!”\nYou are constantly vulnerable to disruption, even by mediocre competition. This is the weakest position you could be in, because you’re coercing customers instead of delighting them.\nsource\n\n“[When you increase WTP], you’re adding value for the consumer, and then figuring out how to split that with the consumer.”\n⁠—Michael Mauboussin,interviewed on the Invest like the Best podcast.\n\nCreating value for the customer comes first. Then⁠—and only then⁠—you can decide how to “split it with the customer,” either leveraging Consumer Surplus for advocacy, high-retention, and growth, or indeed by raising prices.\nWhen you create that value through Love or Utility, this is both sustainable and profitable. When it’s through Coercion, it is temporary at best.\nThe strongest organizations have all three. For example, Apple generates Love through appealing design, being a statement of personal brand, and maintaining the highest standard of privacy even if it means the product is less functional or interoperable. Apple also leverages utility, becoming familiar and convenient (and thus a mental effort to switch away), and trying to become the center of everything from family photos to shared files to 10,000 notes to the common way to purchase things, creating a form of “lock-in” that feels useful rather than evil. But it leverages Coercion as well, as users are locked-in even when they’d prefer not to be, unable to export data from apps like Notes, and being forced to buy new devices as older ones suspiciously stop working well after applying new (mandatory) operating system upgrades, and changing the connectors on charging cables every 5-10 years.\nIn any case, Apple has increased WTP in all three ways over the past ten years, and they’ve split that with their customers, as evidenced by a consistent profit margin:\nsource\nFigure 2: Apple’s net profit margin:\nIf they were increasing prices faster than WTP, profits would have increased.\nEven the cold-blooded capitalist should eschew Coercion\nHere’s why Love and Utility results in more valuable companies, even though it prioritizes Consumer Surplus over profits:\nImagine there are two companies, alike in every way: Same product, same industry, same market, same number of customers at the same price, at the same costs, and thus the same revenue, same profit, and same WTP. The only difference is:\n\nCompany’s WTP is generated only by Love.\nCompany’s WTP is generated only by Coercion.\n\nWhich one is most likely to grow in volume and profit over the next five years? Which is more likely to capture more market share? In other words, which is the better investment for a Venture Capitalist?\nI’d pick (1). I know their customer base will help them grow efficiently, while competitors look on helplessly, unable to convert customers even with the lure of unique features and lower prices. Whereas I know (2)’s customer base will be trying to leave, praying another competitor comes to save them, publicly warding away potential customers from repeating their mistake.\nIt is also possible for (1) to add Utility or even Coercive WTP to their strategy, further strengthening their position, whereas it is much more difficult for (2) to generate Love starting from their current position. It’s not that Coercion is never an appropriate ingredient, but rather that the other two are better.14\n\n14 It’s like the Agile Manifesto: When it says “Working software over comprehensive documentation,” it isn’t saying “Documentation is bad.” Rather, it’s saying “Working software” is more valuable, so that’s where we should spend most of our energy.\n\nLove beats Coercion, even as cold-blooded, money-grubbing capitalist investor, indifferent to ethics or the betterment of the world.\nAnd yet Love makes money while in fact bettering the world, and making everyone happier.\nSo choose Love by building it into your strategy, investing in it, and then reveling in what you’ve created.\n\nYou can apply this concept directly to your strategy, and merge it with other techniques.\nKano (Figure 3)\n“Love” feels a lot like Kano ’s “Delight”⁠—a joyous, perhaps even unexpected upside. “Utility” maps to “Performance”⁠—where the more of it there is, the more value it is to the customer. “Coercive” maps to “Inverse”⁠—something that customers actively dislike, even though you gain the selfish corporate benefit of retention.\nFigure 3: The Kano model\nMoats\nMany of these things sound like moats, and for good reason: Increasing WTP of any type increases your ability to capture and retain customers. The more forceful (whether positive or negative), the more that becomes a permanent advantage that others cannot dislodge. No one can take away a fantastic brand, and government fiat can last for decades.\nAn interesting example is “network effect,” because it shows up in all three types:\n\n“Love” network effects include community and ecosystem, where participants help one another personally and professionally.\nOne “Utility” network effect is a functioning marketplace, so e.g. eBay was for decades the destination having the greater number of buyers and sellers of collectable objects, and thus genuinely the most useful place to transact. You might not “love” eBay, but certainly people went there because it was useful, not because they were forced to.\nOne “Coercive” network effect is when choice is limited to “preferred vendors,” creating a cartel rather than creating choice. For example, the United States health care system features insurance companies who each support their own network of doctors. A consequence is that switching insurance can mean you have to switch family doctors⁠—an unnecessary and “value-destroying” activity as an economist would say.\n\nStart with “Why”\n“Love” reinforces the Simon Sinek’s admonition that companies must “Start with Why,” i.e. understand and articulate its higher purpose, it’s mission, because when that’s strong and important, when it permeates everything from its market-positioning to its culture to its employees, it’s extremely powerful, and impossible for a competitor to destroy.\nExample:Buffer has a relatively undifferentiated product and pays lower salaries than many people can get elsewhere, but their culture and transparency is second-to-none, and people want to be a part of that. Example: TruthSocial, which can’t pay salaries like Twitter, and doesn’t have the reach of Twitter, and has technical issues with downtime and slow innovation, nevertheless possesses a rabid fanbase because of the mission and community.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: The six kinds of “buyer utility”\nIn Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne highlight six ways in which you can deliver “value” to customers. These are a subset of the more general reasons why people are compelled to buy, but it’s useful to emphasize the cases where the customer is benefiting directly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Ocean   Buyer UtilityWTP CategoryCommentaryCustomer   ProductivityUtilityThis category is too broad; it is important to distinguish between “more value” and “less cost.” Both contribute to “productivity,” but it is an order of magnitude more important to increase value. It’s also important to define value.SimplicityUtilityIncluded above.ConvenienceUtilityIncluded above, in several forms; for example “location” is a specific kind of convenience.RiskUtilityIncluded above.Fun &amp; ImageLoveIncluded above.Environmental   FriendlinessLoveIncluded in a more expansive “social and environmental impact,” as nowadays (2023) it is more common for customers to make buying decisions on factors like Fairtrade, or purchasing from local or minority-owned business, or supporting businesses with specific values and public commitments, in addition to the idea of being friendly to the environment.\nLong-term engagement metrics\nMany products wish to “drive engagement.” Some point to Facebook as the pinnacle of “growth hacking,” driving up numbers, often slipping away from Utility (to say nothing of Love) and into Coercive tricks.\nBut even at Facebook, solving for Utility over Coercion worked better. In a fascinating multi-year UX experiment, Facebook found that when they reduced the quantity of notifications (by keeping the quality high), it had the expected negative result on engagement: Customer satisfaction increased, but app usage decreased (because it was leading you back to the app less often). But, after a year, app usage actually increased and remained higher that it was before the change. Increasing genuine satisfaction created more engagement in the long run. They had to be patient to see the results; traditional “growth hacking” did not discover the best solution.\n\nMany thanks to John Doherty for contributing insights to early drafts.\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\nlongform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/\n© 2007-2025 Jason Cohen  @asmartbear\n\nPricing determines your business model\nPricing is inextricably linked to brand, product, and purchasing decisions.

Make a SLC instead.","links":[],"tags":["clippings"],"content":"Summary\nThe article critiques the traditional \\“Minimum Viable Product\\” (MVP) approach as selfish and detrimental to customer experience, advocating instead for \\“Simple, Lovable, Complete\\” (SLC) products. SLCs are built to be simple for quick development, lovable to engage users despite initial limitations, and complete within their defined scope, providing immediate value. Unlike MVPs, SLCs foster customer loyalty and allow for more flexible future development, either growing in complexity or remaining simple. The author argues that SLC breaks the traditional Maslow-like product hierarchy by prioritizing delight and usefulness from the outset, leading to products customers genuinely love and connect with.\nKey Points\n\nMVPs are flawed: They are selfish, abuse customers for learning, are too ‘Minimum’ and rarely ‘Viable’, and customers hate them.\nIntroduce SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete):\n\nSimple: Allows for quick, inexpensive building and testing.\nLovable: Customers genuinely want to use it; love overcomes initial bugs/limited features.

Instead, make the first version SLC: Simple, Lovable, and Complete”.\nsource\nDisillusioned with MVP\nProduct teams have been repeating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mantra for a decade now, without re-evaluating whether it’s the right way to maximize learning while pleasing the customer.\nWell, it’s not the best system. It’s selfish and it hurts customers. We don’t build MVPs at WP Engine.\nThe motivation behind the MVP is still valid:\n\nBuild something small, because small things are quick and inexpensive to test.\nGet it into the market quickly, because real learning occurs only when real customers are using a real product.\nTrash it or hard-pivot if it’s a failure, or invest if it’s a seedling with potential.\n\nMVPs are great for startups and product teams because they maximize so-called “validated learning” as quickly as possible. And while customer interviews are useful, you learn new things when a customer actually uses the product. But MVPs are a selfish act.\nThe problem is: Customers hate MVPs. Startups are encouraged by the great Reid Hoffman to “launch early enough that you’re embarrassed by your v1.0 release.” But no customer wants to use an unfinished product that the creators are embarrassed by. Customers want great products they can use now.\nMVPs are too M and rarely V. Customers see that, and hate it. It might be great for the product team, but it’s bad for customers. And ultimately, what’s bad for customers is bad for the company.\nFortunately, there’s a better way to build and validate products. The insight comes from honoring the utility of MVPs (listed above) while giving just as much consideration to the customer’s experience.\nSLC: Simple, Lovable, Complete\nIn order for the product to be small and delivered quickly, it has to be simple. Customers accept simple products every day. Even if it doesn’t do everything needed, as long as the product never claimed to do more than it does, customers are forgiving. For example, it was okay that early versions Google Docs had only 3% of the features of Microsoft Word, because Docs did a great job at what it was primarily designed for, which is simplicity and real-time collaboration.\nGoogle Docs was simple, but also complete. This is decidedly different from the classic MVP, which by definition isn’t complete (in fact, it’s “embarrassing”). “Simple” is good, “incomplete” is not. The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, as-is. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple.\nIt is not contradictory for products to be simple as well as complete. Examples include the first versions of WhatsApp, Snapchat, Stripe, Twilio, Twitter, and Slack. Some of those later expanded to add complexity (Snapchat, Stripe, Slack), whereas some kept it simple as a permanent value (Twitter, WhatsApp). Virgin Air and Southwest Airlines both started with just one route. Southwest Airlines is the most profitable US airline in history. Small, but complete.\nThe final ingredient, and the one most unlike MVP, is for the product to be lovable. People have to want to use it. Products that do less but are loved, are more successful than products which have more features and are disliked. The original, very-low-feature, very-highly-loved, hyper-successful early versions of all the products listed in the previous paragraph are examples. The Darwinian success loop of a product is a function of love, not of features.\nThere are many ways to generate love. “Minimum” and “viable” are definitely not among those ways. The current-in-vogue way is through design: Elegant UX combined with delightful UI. But there are other ways. The attitude and culture of the company itself can generate love, such as Buffer’s blog with its delightfully shocking transparency (including open salaries and corporate metrics) or MeetEdgar’s blog genuinely helping entrepreneurs or HubSpot’s blog which early on was at least as instrumental to their customers’ success as the actual product. Another way is through a deep connection to the psyche of customers, like Heroku who broke with marketing tradition by filling the homepage with command-line examples instead of benefit-statements, thereby connecting instantly with their geeky target customer:\nFigure 1\nRead about “WTP” for many more examples of how to generate love.\nFrom this reasoning, years ago I named what I believe is the correct alternative to the MVP: Simple, Lovable and Complete (SLC). We pronounce it “Slick.” As in: “What’s the ‘Slick’ version of your idea?”\nSLC Summary\nS imple, because complex things can’t be built quickly, and you must ship quickly so you can learn quickly so you can create the right product before you run out of money and willpower.\nL ovable, because crappy products are insulting, and you didn’t start this company to make crappy products. The love overpowers the fact that the product is buggy and feature-poor. There are many wonderful, powerful, competitively-defensible forms of “Love.” Pick some.\nC omplete, because products are supposed to accomplish a job. Customers want to use a v1 of something simple, not v0.1 of something broken.\nLife after SLC\nAnother benefit of SLC becomes apparent when you consider the next version of the product.\nA SLC product does not require on-going development. It is possible that v1 should evolve for years into a v4, but you also have the option of not investing further, yet the product still creates value. An MVP that never gets additional investment is just a bad product. A SLC that never gets additional investment is a good, if modest product.\nMany of the most successful software products in the world started as SLC, then grew in complexity, including examples we’ve already given (Google Docs and Snapchat).\nThe first iteration of Snapchat was a screen where tapping anywhere took a picture, that you could then send to someone else, at which time it disappeared. No video, no filters, no social networking, no commenting and no storage⁠—Simple, yet Lovable and Complete, as evidenced by its rapid adoption. The insight of “no storage” was critical, but many people have theorized that the simplicity of the interface was also critical. The very fact that it was simple, while not sacrificing love-ability or completeness, caused its success.\nLater they added lots of stuff⁠—video, filters, timelines, “stories”, even video cameras inside sunglasses. It’s OK for products to become complex. Starting out SLC does not preclude becoming complex later.\nWhatsApp was similar; it started with just a status message. Not a “post”, not a “chat”, no “timelines”, no “history”. Just “What’s up?”, hence the name of the app. They found people abusing the system to communicate with each other without paying for SMS messages, so they added chat. Dropbox started with just one folder that would (eventually!) sync across devices. Twitter had only the 140-character messages; things like replies and re-tweets were invented by users, implemented by convention, and only later folded back into the platform as built-in features. The examples go on and on.\nSLC breaks Maslow’s Product Hierarchy of Needs\nPeople erroneously believe that product development should work like Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs:\nsource\nFigure 2: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nHis insight is that you cannot achieve higher levels if you haven’t at least satisfied the lower levels: If you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, you’re not able to “creatively discover your true self.”\nThe framework is wrong, though this hasn’t stopped people from writing books and blog posts about it. “At the time of its original publication in 1943, there was no empirical evidence to support the theory.” “In a 1976 review of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, little evidence was found for the specific ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.” (From Wikipedia, with its own references.)\nIt’s wrong for Product also, but we act like it’s true.\nIf we roughly parallel Maslow, the Product Hierarchy looks something like (Figure 3), defining the levels as:\nMeaningful\nIdentity, belonging, higher purpose. “Larger than myself.” Impact. Legacy.\nDelightful\nExceptionally wonderful to use, eliciting a strong positive emotion. It goes beyond being visually appealing or sensibly designed. It is at least extreme; it is likely surprising, because so few products delight us, especially in the business world. Perhaps a low bar makes delight easier to achieve, if we try.\nEasy to use\nEffortless and intuitive. Makes tech support obsolete.\nReliable\nAlways works as promised.\nUseful\nFulfills a need; solves a problem.\nFigure 3: Pseudo-Maslow Product Hierarchy\nFollowing Maslow, we might say that if a product isn’t Useful then it doesn’t matter if it works all the time (Reliable) or is pretty to look at (Delightful), therefore “being useful” is the mandatory first “rung” of the ladder. No reason to do anything else, if you’re not useful.\nIndeed, that’s what traditional MVPs do: be minimally useful, disregarding all other levels as irrelevant until the first level is satisfied:\nFigure 4: The typical MVP is minimally useful only, perhaps also being easy to try.\nThis MVP attitude is further justified by projecting its future. We can map the behavior of mature products, especially in so-called “Enterprise Software” where the person who chooses to buy it isn’t the person who is forced to use it, and therefore the bottom of the pyramid is valued and the top is not:\nFigure 5: Mature products maximize the utility layers; do their users love it, or are they making an internal case for why it should be replaced with a more pleasant competitor?\nThe SLC attitude is different. It agrees that we can’t fill much of any layer, because we need to ship it quickly and start getting feedback. But it emphasizes different layers:\nFigure 6: SLC initially uses Delight to win the hearts of customers even though the product isn’t as useful or reliable as it will eventually be.\nAn SLC product evolves, already-happy customers are rewarded with additional features:\nFigure 7: SLC evolves in a fundamentally different way, creating differentiation beyond feature-bullet-points.\nPerhaps a better way to look at it, is that SLC is both Delightful and Useful on day one, albeit with a scope of “Useful” that is small enough to be “Complete”:\nFigure 8: SLC as complete according to a narrow scope (left), but lacking features relative to the scope of a mature product (right).\nFinally, a product that from inception is trying to “delight customers” is one that might actually deliver on the top of the pyramid: Meaning, personal identity, a higher purpose. You see this in products where people tie their identity to owning or using the product, not just in consumer brands where this is obvious, but in the way that people love Linear because it honors the developer (instead of the project manager), or the way they love Basecamp because they support the culture and attitudes of 37signals, or the way they whip out Moleskine notebooks because it connects them to a romantic ideal of the brooding writer, or proudly wear Patagonia gear as a badge of their environmental consciousness, or the way they argue over Vim vs Emacs as a badge of geekery.\nAlmost no company cares about creating meaning for their customers. Here’s how I know: What metric are they tracking ⁠—let alone optimizing for⁠—that measures meaning? If none, then it’s out of sight, out of mind. Clearly, you can build large and even great companies like this; most do. But if you did care about that, SLC is the right way to start the adventure.\nWhy don’t more products prioritize delight? Utility is more obvious. Utility is what the customer’s budget is allocated to obtain. Delight requires insight and great design, not back-end optimization and a keen mathematical mind. It is a rare person who possess all of these abilities, or even values them in others. It is a decision to prioritize Delight over Utility; it is easier not to.\nThe “pyramid” is useful for mapping out where you’re going to spend your time, but we need not traverse it from bottom to top. Products that prioritize delight win over products that don’t.\nIt’s really another way of prioritizing the customer⁠—the human being, not just their “job to be done.”\n\nWith SLC, the outcomes are better and your options for next steps are better. It might fail; both SLCs and MVPs sometimes produce that result because you’re running an experiment. But if a SLC succeeds, you’ve already delivered real value to customers and you have multiple futures available to you, none of which are urgent. You could build a v2, and because you’re already generating value, you have more time to decide what that should look like. You could even query existing customers to determine exactly what v2 should entail, instead of a set of alpha-testers who just want to know “when are you going to fix this broken thing?”\nOr, you can decide not to work on it. Not every product has to become complex. Not every product needs new major versions every two quarters. Some things can just remain simple, lovable, and complete.\nAsk your customers. They’ll agree.\n\nMany thanks to Devan Stormont,Kathy Qian, and Khurrum Mahmood for feedback on this article.\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear\nlongform.asmartbear.com/slc/\n© 2007-2025 Jason Cohen  @asmartbear\n\nStop saying “fail”\nLanguage shapes our perception of setbacks.

The speaker differentiates ML from traditional rule-based AI, highlighting ML’s ability to learn patterns from data but noting its black-box nature and susceptibility to data biases. Key concepts covered include features, labeled vs. unlabeled data, and types of ML: supervised (regression, classification), unsupervised (clustering, anomaly detection), self-supervised, and reinforcement learning. The lecture also touches on model training, the importance of generalization vs. memorization (underfitting/overfitting), and ethical considerations like data collection, bias, and fairness.\nKey Points\n\nWhat is Machine Learning (ML)? An AI approach where computers learn to make decisions and predictions from data, without explicit programming.\nWhy use ML? For tasks difficult to define with rule-based systems (e.g., handwritten text, machine translation, recommendation systems).\nML vs. Traditional AI:\n\nTraditional AI (Handcrafted/Expert Systems): Rule-based, predictable, requires expert knowledge, but hard to scale.\nMachine Learning (Learned Systems): Learns from data, identifies patterns, can be unpredictable when failing, relies heavily on data quality.\n\n\nData is Key: ML models learn from training data sets, which provide examples of input and often corresponding output (labels).\nFeatures: Quantifiable properties of input data chosen to be helpful for prediction.\nTypes of Machine Learning:\n\nSupervised Learning: Uses labeled data (input-output pairs).\n\nRegression: Predicts a continuous real value (e.g., house price).\nClassification: Predicts a category/class from fixed options (e.g., spam/not spam, digit recognition).\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find patterns or structure (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection).\nSelf-Supervised Learning: Generates labels from the data itself (e.g., predicting the next word in a sentence).\nReinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error based on a reward/penalty system (e.g., playing games).\n\n\nModel Training and Generalization:\n\nAim for models that generalize well to new, unseen data, rather than just memorizing training examples.\nUnderfitting: Model performs poorly on both training and unseen data (too simple).\nOverfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data (too complex, memorized).\nUse a separate test set to evaluate generalization.\n\n\nEthical Considerations: Data collection practices, inherent biases in data leading to biased models, and ensuring fairness.\n\n\nstanford.zoom.us/rec/play/74vznYB-noSydpdhVd5uqr7tZg9sfSNH28zOGvkT5OH5oYHCaxodw7u5Y1QA51Ko1x6QZkyxowVCzbIK.wHKnZ7tMGcwEWj93%3A%2F%2Fstanford.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FNbM2G6PrgLbxQnsy3EX-9kxM_gGyMLSYafjnxcH7Bp7BYmrcIKaHf0yxiZHnKw_X.6V92l5X74IXfLk3y\nOriginal Content\nAccessibility Overview\n\n00:00:00 / 01:17:47\nAudio Transcript\nChat Messages\n\n00:00:02\nAlright.

Thank you so much. Please welcome Shaitanya Patel from Stanford University.\n00:01:10\nCool. Thanks, madam, for the introduction. Very detailed introduction. I would say, so. Yeah. I’m 4th year Csphe student working in 3D computer vision. And it’s really good to see you all just to get the logistics correct. So I’m sharing my screen. And I have\nyou everyone in a gallery on another screen. I have chat open. So if you have any question, just type it in the chat, and if it’s urgent, and if I fail to notice, you can just interrupt me. Okay.\ndoes that sound good?\n00:01:49\nSounds good.\n00:01:51\nSo should we start.\n00:01:53\nYes, please. Go ahead.\n00:01:55\nCool.\nyeah. So today I’ll be talking about introduction to machine learning if I know correctly. You have had a 1st lecture yesterday with Peter Norwig, very veteran computer scientist in AI. So he talked in general about AI here, I’ll talk a bit more technical into machine learning.\nOkay.\nso this is the today’s lesson roadmap. We’ll be talking about what machine learning is, how does it fit into AI? And how does it work for the bullet point 4 and 5. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to cover that. But if we have time I’ll also go into that. So my focus will be to just focus on 1, 2, 3 for now?\nCool. So what is my and also like? Feel free to ask the question like, let’s make it as interactive as possible. So it’s fun for everybody.\nSo yeah, what is machine learning?\nSo machine learning is that approach an AI approach where we\nteach computers how to make decisions and prediction from data data. Here is a key point. So machine learning is a type of AI, so that we don’t have to program whatever we want to do explicitly, it will learn from the data on its own.\nOkay, yeah. So why do we want to do that, in 1st place. So\nsome tasks that we want to do\nthey are very hard to describe with rule-based system. For example, let’s say you want to detect handwritten text.\nNow, there are many ways to write things right, and we can’t describe every single possible way in the program.\nBut\nin machine learning, what we do is like. We provide many, many examples of handwritten text and corresponding like what’s written there. And the model will learn itself how texts look like.\nSo we don’t have to program anything explicitly.\nAnother example is machine translation. Let’s say I want to translate English into Chinese. Now, I don’t know Chinese, so I don’t, since I don’t know Chinese, I don’t even know how to, you know. Instruct how to derive rules for translating English into Chinese.\nBut in Ml, if I have data of English and Chinese paired translation, I can create an AI that can do that task without even me knowing how to speak Chinese, and I don’t need to program every translation and every approaches myself.\nAnd the good thing is like.\nif I have a program, and if I have a code set up and everything to translate English to Chinese.\nI can use the same program, same thing to train a model which can do any translation from English to some other language, let’s say.\nokay,\nAnother example of machine learning would be digit recognition. It’s a similar. It’s similar to handwritten text recognition. But we are just focusing on the digits. So\nwe can say that there are many ways to write 0 ones twos. And I mean, you can try deriving a rule based system. Okay, one will be a line going from top to bottom. But some people write it a bit slanted. So you can try that. But you can see that like sometimes lines get blurry. I mean\none. If in for example, this particular 7, it looks very much like one.\nSo when you try to go with like rule based system, sometimes it get very tricky. But we can just show machine learning model. A lot of example of 0 ones and twos, and it will learn by itself.\nSo, yeah, how. And this is another recommendation system you might have seen on Amazon. When you buy a book it will show\nrecommendation for other products which are similar, and\nSo how do we do that? Actually.\nso it’s all about data data is at the heart of the machine learning. So a training data set provides examples of input and output, telling the model how it should behave. So\nyou can take an analogy between for understanding how Ml. And traditional AI works. So if your parents give you a rule of every scenario that would be more like traditional rule-based AI.\nBut if your parents give you feedback on how your action was.\nYou can consider that as a training data, so your parents can’t provide a guidance on every possible scenario that’s going to happen. But if you make a mistake, parents can provide. Okay, maybe in these kind of things, you shouldn’t do that, or maybe in these kind of things. You should do this. So you can consider that\nas an example of training set. And over time you learn a general behavior of like what’s good and what’s bad. So it’s same with the machine learning model. You provide examples of what it should do in certain scenarios, and it will make a general idea of like how it should predict on any new scenario or any new input. So\nfor\nlet’s say, you want a machine learning model that can classify that can say, if an image is of apples and orange. So what you can do is like you can have a data set where you have many examples of\norange images. And you say that, okay, this is orange. This is orange. This is Apple. This is apple.\nOr if you have a language data set.\nand you want to classify, if that particular piece of text is positive or not, so you can do that. And\nit can be really tricky to do with a rule based system. For example, you want to classify Amazon reviews for a TV\nif it’s positive or not. Now, a positive review might be something like this using this TV was a blast.\nand it looks like a positive review, right?\nBut another review can be. When I turned on the TV, it had a blast. That’s a negative review. And if you just try to create a rule based system like, if it’s a blast, then it’s probably negative.\nIt won’t probably work well on these kind of complex languages. So yeah.\nSo we have been talking about about this. But how does machine learning fit into general AI, so\nmachine learning is a part of AI. So machine learning models are AI models, but not all AI models are machine learning models.\nSo machine learning model is a part of AI which learns to make decision based on data.\nOh, and not all AI algorithms needs data.\nBut recently, all of many, almost all of the successful AI systems are based on machine learning. So that’s why it’s all the current hype about that?\nthere is.\nmessage from chat. If you want to do, ml, to find independent data, would the training data consist of just inputs or input output, I think, oh, yeah. So the question is, should the training data contain only input or the pairs of input and output both. And we’ll actually talk about that. So that’s a nice question. It’s there in the next few slides.\nSo talking about difference between General AI and machine learning. So, as I said, it can be either handcrafted or learned from data. So a handcrafted system\nwill be things like, okay,\ndeciding something based on some symptoms. So doctors may use some kind of rule based system. So if it’s fever and a cough, then it’s maybe this kind of disease if it’s fever, but there is not cough, then it might be something like this. So these kind of rule based system\nyou need an expert to\ncreate the system. And the benefit is that it has a predictable behavior\nwhen it fails. You know where it fails.\nWow!\nBut the problem is like you want to, you will need to cover all the possible scenarios.\nwhereas a learned system, which is a system, a machine learning system which is learned from data.\nIt can take advantage of patterns.\nand you don’t need to specify that. And it can learn to make decision on its own.\nBut the problem is, when it fails, you don’t know how it fails or why it fails, or you don’t know how. Maybe you can correct that.\nSo the only way to correct is\njust have more data on the specific scenario that you don’t want it to fail. So\nthat’s the one downside of using using machine learning.\nSo now, going into the\ngoing into the actual, really meat of the lecture, how does it work? How do we do that?\nSo\nin any kind of machine learning problem. First, st you need is a data set a data set of training examples.\nSo for for every input example, what we usually do we derive a set of features?\nSo what is a feature a feature?\nokay, there is also another question, what is the rule of labeled versus unlabeled data in machine learning. Oh, you are all going very ahead. It’s coming in. So yeah, difference between label and unlabeled data.\nSo, okay, coming back to the slide.\nFeature is a property of your input which might be helpful for a prediction.\nand that feature is a way of describing that attribute which will be helpful for the machine learning model to understand. It’s something which you can quantify in code which can quantify in computer. And we want to choose the most relevant one.\nIt can be either binary label\nyes or no, or it can be a real value. What actual number is, or it can take one of the small possible numbers. So take an example of this. You want to classify whether a fruit is orange or apple.\nNow think about how a machine would learn to do that\nis. Now I want your answer is mass or shape of the object, a good feature or no.\nto classify whether the current object in your hand is apple or orange. Oh, a lot of people are saying no.\nwhich is true, because both are almost similar similar weight. And yeah, and similar shape. So mass and shape is an example of features which is derived from the actual input object. But they are not helpful.\nHow about color? Is color a good feature?\nYes. So\nOranges are mostly orange, and apples are. Most apples are distinctively different than orange in color, so it is a good feature. So\nso color is an example of good feature that you want to use.\nbut sometimes not. Color is not sufficient. Sometimes oranges are a bit yellowish, and if an apple is not ripe enough it can be yellowish. So\none feature is not enough. So what we usually do is we derive a collection of features that are useful in combination.\nAnd yeah, in this example the labels are apple and orange. So? Sorry\nthere was a question.\nSorry.\n00:15:15\nI think that somebody was accidentally came off of mute.\n00:15:20\nOh, okay, no problem.\nAll right. Now, going into the math of this, how do we formalize this?\nSo your input, your input, example is set of features described from your data. So your\ninput can be a picture, an email, a sentence song, anything but you derive necessary features on top of.\nThat\nso? Your data is X, and you derive a set of features from one example. So for apple it might be, it’s a mass.\nits color, and whether it has a round shape or not. So, for one particular example, it will be mass 1.5 color green, and it has a roundish shape.\nwhat? There is another question. What is the best way to extract data? Is there any program or application?\nThat’s a good question.\nData is almost always curated by annotators. So in all big machine learning models, companies basically employ a set of annotators, and they will label high quality data. So it’s almost always. But there are a few examples where you can get it automatically. We’ll talk about that later. Yeah.\nand the labeled example, is a set of features and corresponding label. So in our example, our set of features for one particular object was this, and the label is app.\nAnd finally, your data set is a collection of labeled or unlabeled examples. Again, I’ll talk more about difference between label and unlabeled later. But in your project this is how you will formalize your\nthis is how you’ll formalize your problem into data.\ncool! There is another question in the chat. What kind of AI does not use machine learning?\nI gave an example of an expert system deciding what kind of disease a person has based on symptoms.\nSo you can think of it. A flow chart, a flow chart of rule based system\nis A is an example of AI which doesn’t use. Data.\nit was a clear, direct way to create an AI\nthat imitates an expert knowledge in some way.\nThere is another question.\nAre handcrafted AI systems the same as expert systems. That’s correct. Yeah. Expert systems are rule-based, handcrafted system.\nOkay, how can we detect and fix human error and bias? I will talk about that. This is the 4th bullet point, 4th or 5th bullet point in the series of lecture. So we’ll talk about that.\ncool. So in your project, how does your data look like? So the data is usually in form of a matrix, or you can think of a spreadsheet where each row is one example, and each column describes one feature of that particular example.\nSo\nhere it’s a data set of books each column. There are columns like title author average rating on maybe goodreads or something language. And each row is basically information about\none particular book.\nAnd yeah, there are many example of data sets. We can actually look into that.\nLet’s see, let’s let’s see if you can find. Oh, oh, yeah.\nthis is a data set of packed adoption records with animal and adopter data. And\nthis is a data set. Basically, there is an Id of the pet, the name of the pet species breed. What’s the age gender color? And finally, whether the pet was adopted or not\nby this. Maybe you can now create an AI model which will take all the pet information you can create an Ml. Model which will take all the pet information, and it will probably predict whether this pet will be adopted or not. So\nthis is one kind of data set. And in Kaggle, you can basically find, like many interesting data sets. So Kaggle is a website where, there are a collection of data sets and best performing models on those data sets which people have submitted to the website.\nOkay?\nNow there have been many, many questions on the chat.\nAnd I see some other students are also answering, that’s good.\nOkay. For deep learning, for a task such as classifying images. Do you really need to include features.\nor can the model derive them by itself? This is a very good question.\nSo\nI think that’s out of the scope of this lecture, but I can give you a direct answer that initially, when there are not a lot of data sets and not a lot of compute.\npeople used to derive features so that the learning is easier.\nBut right now, with a lot of data and a lot of compute.\nwe can just have a bigger, more complex model. And let the data let the model figure out features by itself.\nor you can think of it. And another way, the data itself is just one big feature. That’s it. So image itself is just a feature\nand network will machine learning model will try to decide try to get some features on its own from the data and learn to classify.\nOkay?\nyeah. Again, there, there are some questions on label and unlabel data. And that’s where we are. Coming to right now. So types of machine learning.\nwhat different kind of machine learnings are there? The most common is supervised machine learning.\nWhere your data set is labeled, meaning it has examples and corresponding labels.\nSo here I’m showing an example where?\nThe problem we want to\ndeal with is classification of input images into digits.\nAnd you have in your data set, you have many images of someone’s handwritten digits and corresponding label of what’s written there. So this is 7. This is 8. So this is an example of label data.\nand another example of label data might be. Let’s say you want to learn a classifier to classify email into\na label of spam or not spam. Then you will have a data set of all the email text. And for every email you will have, it’s a label, whether it was spam or not.\nAnd similarly, image classification data set where you have images, and for every class of every classifiable category.\nSo\nin so supervised learning, most of the Ml literature is at least traditionally, was built around supervised learning. But many of the things can be transferred into other types of learning which I’ll talk about next. But for now let’s talk about supervised machine learning. So what you want to do is we want to model. We want to get\na computational model which imitates your training data.\nYour training data has\nexamples and corresponding output. We want a computation model which can assign a label to all the input data point in a similar way.\nSo you can think of a machine learning model as a function, a mathematical function.\nIt’s a function of your input example. X, and the output of the model is whatever prediction you want to do.\nclass of the label, or some kind of real value.\nAnd things like that.\nOkay.\nNow.\nin supervised learning. There are 2 types of supervised machine learning, one’s called regression, and the other one is called classification.\nYou, you want to output a continuous real value. For example.\nif you want to create a model which can estimate price of a house. Let’s say your input feature is the square footage of the house.\nSo your input is a square footage of the house. It’s a real value ranging from possibly 0 to very high, and your output is again a real value. The price of the house\nso that is an example of regression.\nand in classification your output is a class. It’s a category out of the fixed number of categories. So for email classification. You know, the output is only spam or not spam. So that’s an example of classification.\nHere on the right you can. This is a very simple example of how regression and classification look like. So on the top.\nit’s a regression on XX. 6, you can think of\none single input feature, and on the Y-axis, the output real value.\nSo square footage and the price of the house\nand your machine learning model will try to\nOh.\non the bottom, it’s an example of a classification with 2 features you have x, 1 and x 2\nand machine learning model will try to learn a boundary which can separate between 2 classes.\nOkay?\nOh, cool.\nNow let me go through some questions.\nare unsupervised AI models key to Agi.\nI think yes. So the question is basically unsupervised AI models, models which don’t require label data. Are they really key to Agi. It’s kind of a practical question, because labeling requires human effort\nand label data can be only so big unlabeled data. On the other hand, it’s on Internet, you can scrape it. It’s a lot of data. And when you have a lot of data, you have a much better working model. So right now, due to these practical data limitations.\nunsupervised model, if you can. If you can pose a particular problem into unsupervised one, then yeah, it. It tends to do better right now.\nhow does model deal with outliers?\nUsually doesn’t. So\nthere are class of machine learning models which are specifically designed to be robust, took outliers. So\nfor uninitiated, like outlier, is a data example which is like very dissimilar to your original training site. And the model can fail in a lot of unpredictable way. So again, that’s out of the scope of this lecture. So I’ll not discuss that\nin real world scenarios. I assume there will be a lot of dimensions. So that’s a comment from Ronak. So yeah, that’s correct. Here. I’m showing example of one D or 2D regression and classification task. But in real world you have a lot of features which you can’t even visualize in on screen, or even in 3D.\nHow do we use logistic regression for more parameters?\nI think I’ll talk about regression in a bit. So yeah.\nhow do you even figure out which K. To use for each of those like, what’s the secret sauce for picking the best K\nfor your model directory works? I’m not sure what K refers to here.\nbut I think it will be discussed\nlater. Yeah, I think it’s the question about unsupervised learning which will come later. Here, okay, let’s\nwork through one regression example. So\nhigh school, Gpa versus a college Gpa, so let’s say, you want to\ncreate a machine learning model which can predict a student’s college Gpa, based on high school. Gpa.\nso input X\nis the students high school, Gpa, and your output Y is the students college, Gpa. And you have a training data like this. So for many students, you have their high school, Gpa. And College, Gpa.\nAnd you can plot them on a 2D plane. So on. X and y, and you have dots for each.\nExample.\nNow, can you come up with other features which might be useful, because, I mean, we know that higher high school, Gpa. Roughly translates to higher quality Gpa. But there are other factors. You can see that there is no linear relationship between X and Y here. So what other features might be useful?\nI can give an example. It can be the\ndifficulty level of the high school courses that the student have taken\nright. So if there is a low Gpa, but the courses were actually difficult.\nThen maybe you want to predict a bit higher. College. Gpa, so yeah.\nyeah, number of Ap class. So I think that’s time spent studying.\nThat’s a good feature, but I don’t know if it’s a positive or higher or negative or higher\nstandardized test score. So yeah, your sat score on top of high school. Gpa is also a good\nIQ, okay, that’s interesting. IQ is, it’s debatable. I would say\nand then yeah.\nJob status which is equal to time taken.\nLet’s go school funding levels of extracurriculars.\nSo yeah, you can see that there are many features. Some features are directly indicative, but some features are maybe slightly indicative. So you want to pick features which are\nuseful.\nand if you pick too many features, then you can run into war fitting, which we will discuss later.\nSo, yeah, a lot of examples of the features.\nAnd yeah, so that’s good. We’ll still stick with the single feature example for for this example.\nSo, yeah, how? What will be a machine learning model on this particular task?\nSo we can think of the simplest form of machine learning model, which is a linear model.\nIt takes an X, and it predicts Y\nbased on a linear relationship. So w. 1 x plus W. 2, it’s the simplest form of Model\nX is the input w. 1 and W. 2 are your model parameters. So it’s\nit’s what machine learning model is. These 2 parameters.\nAnd we don’t know. We want to learn them from data. And why is the output value?\nSo now, given a label data point of X and Y,\nhow can you determine? Best set of w. 1 and W. 2.\nThat works right? So that’s what model training is.\nSo\nthis is an example of like your data set, you have X and Y, high school, Gpa. And College, Gpa.\nAnd since your model, your model is linear, it’s a linear regression model\nW. And WW. 1 and W. 2 will decide a line that passes through this, and you want to fit the best line. So this is an example of line. But\nthis is another machine learning model which is predicting something like this.\nBut this is another model which is predicting something like this.\nAnd you can see blue line.\nAnd what is the best? I mean, some people. Okay, okay, X, the red line is fitting the best. But Blue Line is also doing one job that it it is always\nunder predicting the university. Gpa.\nRight? So it always under promise, it never over promises. So for some cases it might be the best line\nin cases where you don’t want students. You don’t want to over promise to students about that college. EPA, maybe the blue line is best. So the best. The definition of best depends on what you want to achieve at the end.\nthen, which is the most common form of machine learning that people do, then you can do that. So\nfor every w. 1 and W. 2, you can actually get an error on your training data. So, for example, for a particular set of w. 1 and W. 2. The model predicted for this particular X. The prediction was around 2.4 or something, but the actual Gpa. Was 3.7 5. So that’s the error. So you would. And there will be error on every training data point, and you\ntry to find w. 1 and W. 2 such that the error is smallest possible. And that’s what the training of the machine learning model is. You try to find model parameters such that your error is the smallest possible.\nOkay, define a loss function and minimize it through gradient descent. That’s correct. So Alex is asking.\nam I talking about the same thing as like defining a loss function and minimizing through gradient descent. That’s precisely correct\ngradient descent. And again, gradient descent. Everything is out of the scope of this class for now. But you will talk about this later. In the coming 2 weeks. During your project\nand classification. I think we already talked about what classification is.\nan example of classification. Based machine learning models are things like this, cancer diagnosis from images. So\nhere you have images of\ncancerous spot on your skin. And the output is the type of skin cancer that you have.\nSo what you see on the\non the images is basically the raw input data that you have.\nNow, if you are able to derive good features out of that.\nthe definition of good features is that when you plot it into. Let’s say this kind of 2D plot.\nEach class is reasonably separated from other class, so that you can create a decision boundary.\nSo\nhere you can see that. Okay, the cluster here is probably the blue class. Here is the orange class. So you want to derive your features such that there is an E, you can have an easier machine learning model which can classify on that.\nHere the linear model won’t be enough. For example, the blue is somewhere in the middle.\nYou need a sufficient complexity of your model which can.\ndraw a decision boundary which is not linear. It can draw a nonlinear, maybe roundish boundary on that.\nSo yeah, okay.\nand then let’s talk about the other kind of thing which many students ask question about the unsupervised machine learning.\nSo here you have a data set of examples. But you don’t know the labels.\nor you don’t know any kind of label on the data, and that’s called unsupervised learning. For example, you have just images of handwritten digits. You don’t know what each image\nis like, what digit in each image is.\nSo\nwhat can you do with that? For example, yeah. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning which deals with unlabeled data. So on the left. You have a set of data points, but you don’t know. Let’s say the class of that. You don’t know whether each particular.is a cat or dog, or maybe apple or orange. You just have the data, not the labels.\nBut what what can you do on top of this data?\nOne example, one thing which can do is like\nyou can try to see what different kind of clusters there are\nin this example. You don’t know what the label is. But you can roughly see that there are 2 particular distinct clusters of the data.\nSo you can learn structure about the data. You can find new patterns. In your data.\nyou can find an anomaly in the data. Let’s say there was a label. There was a point which is which is very at the top, right?\nIt doesn’t belong to any of the cluster. So you can find anomalies. Basically, this example looks like an anomaly. This looks like an outlier. This looks like maybe a faulty example or not. So on in traditional machine learning, using unsupervised learning. You can do these kind of clustering anomaly detection. You can find structures in your example.\nYeah. There is a question.\nAnd just the thing like, whenever you’re asking the question, it would be better if you ask questions visible to everyone, so that everyone can know the question, and maybe they can answer. So the question is, why would the blue dots be in the orange boundaries.\nAre these outliers? Hmm, I\nthink. Oh, yeah. So I think the question was here. There are some blue dots which are in the orange regions. Are these outliers\nso\npotentially? Yes, but it might also be the case that the set of features which you are which you are using to describe. To plot this plot.\nit might not be enough.\nIt can also be that case. So maybe you need a 3rd dimension where these blue dots are reasonably separated from the orange. Another 3rd feature. So\nthat’s a good question.\nSo\nthe problem with many features is that we can’t visualize the data. So what people do is they have higher dimensional features more than 3 dimension which you can’t visualize.\nAnd then there are some methods which can basically project the high dimensional data into 2D, so that you can visualize. It’s not perfect, but it will give you a rough sense of okay. These features are good or not\ncool. Some cancer tumors look similar. That’s why, okay, yeah.\nAnd why? This might be, it might be that some cancer types look very similar to each other. So.\nyeah, so these, maybe those 2 classes are very hard to classify than among themselves. So cool.\nSo.\nyeah, so this was the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Now I know there are a lot of questions, so\nin many case the boundaries between supervised and unsuperized learning is blurred.\nFor example.\ntake an example of any kind of language model like Chat Gpt, chat, Gpt is trained to predict the next word based on all the previous words\ngreat.\nSo\nin our formalism it has the label, the input is all the previous word, and the output is the next word.\nSo it is a type of supervised learning. But the thing is we don’t need to hand label the data. We can just gather all the text that exist in the world\nfor\nany paragraph. Just take the 1st part of the paragraph and put the next word as its target. So we don’t need any kind of manual effort to label the data.\nSo some people also put that as unsupervised learning.\nor a better, what might be self-supervised learning, because from the data itself you can create some kind of label without requiring human effort.\nSo\nyeah, so learning a language model is a self supervised learning. But it’s still modeled in the sense of supervised learning like you have input and you have particular label as output.\nOkay.\ncool?\nyeah. There is another. I mean, there are many kinds of learning. But the 3rd interesting kind of learning is reinforcement learning.\nNow, what does it mean? It’s\nit’s based on how we sometimes learn\nwhat are good decisions based on reward and penalties.\nSo\nas a child, you don’t know which things are safe or not. If you touch a hot stove surface, then you instantly get a negative reward in form of pain, and then your brain instinctively models that. Okay, maybe you shouldn’t touch the stuff when it’s hot.\nSo here nobody. There was no a label. Example of hot stuff is bad.\nThere was no other signal. The only signal was the reward.\nWhat you felt. It wasn’t a direct reward, saying that the hot stove is bad.\nSo, but it was a reward of positive or negative behavior. And through that you learn\nhow to basically make decisions and reinforcement. Learning does something similar.\nYou don’t specify input and output, but you specify what are the good rewards in a particular situation, and the model will learn\nby trial and error to make decision which leads to higher reward.\nSo that’s the type of machine learning which call, which is called reinforcement learning.\nAnd yeah, you can think of it in a gaming example. When you started playing new game.\nIn the beginning there will be a tutorial of saying what to do. That’s an example of supervised learning. It will say, Okay, go to this place, pick up this object. That’s a supervised learning, but after that there won’t be tutorial. You will start playing. You will fail on your mission or something, and then you will.\nBy time you will learn how to successfully pass the mission right?\nSo passing is a reward, you feel good about it, and you just keep trying and trying until you learn behavior which will get you to pass the mission. So that’s a very good example of\nreinforcement learning in games.\nSo yeah, okay, we have 15 min. So I will go quick on this. So reinforcement learning is like how you learn from trial and error like playing a video game or things like that.\nYou might have seen an example of Alphago. It was a system trained mostly with reinforcement learning.\nbecause there wasn’t a supervised data set of which\nwhich action in a particular state is good or bad, but you can just let the model run and design some kind of reward function, and it will figure out in it on its own\nhow to make decisions that lead to better rewards.\nSo\nyeah, we talked about supervised, unsupervised machine learning. Also reinforcement learning. Semi supervised learning is basically something in between where you have some label data and lots of unlabeled data.\nAnd you try to do better than just training on the label data set.\nSo yeah, I have, like, I can show you, like, really good example here.\nOkay, consider it this way. Let’s say\nthese 2 clusters, some of some of the values in these 2 clusters are labeled.\nSo you can basically learn a supervised classification. It can predict the boundary here, let’s say, because there wasn’t a label example here.\nBut since you know that there is a density of points in unlabeled points in these regions, maybe you want to shift your boundary here.\nSo that’s a form of how unlabeled data can aid supervised learning. And that’s called semi-supervised learning.\nOkay, we have only 13 min. So I’ll go very quickly on these 4th and 5.th Okay,\nokay. So how do you actually train the model? What kind of things you look for when you are training a model. So you have an example. X, you’re training a model F to predict Y,\nso now we have a data set, we call it training set.\nAnd to see how your current model is working, we get some metric, some kind of error metric, which shows that how accurate the model currently is.\nBut I’ll discuss like just working well on the training data is not enough.\nThe model. When you are training a model, you want the model to work well on the new example in future.\nIf the model really work well on the new example which it hasn’t seen in the training data set.\nWe can say that the model generalizes well, it generalized to a new unseen data.\nand if it doesn’t do well, if if it only does well on the training set. But if it doesn’t do well on the new example.\nthen most probably the model is just\nmemorizing all the examples. It it’s not learning good behavior. It’s just memorizing. If this, input, I’ll output this, that’s it.\nAnd\nyeah, we want the model to generalize to new examples instead of memorizing the correct label. And this is\nhow it would look like, let’s say, these wavy points in a wavy pattern. This is your input set, and you want to fit your model\nif your training and\nif model is really doing well, if the model is not doing well on the training set and not doing well on the testing set, also\nthe on unseen example. That means your model is underfitting. So a line is a good example here.\nOn the other hand, if your model is doing really well on the training data, but on unseen example, it’s doing really bad. Then it’s called overfitting. So\nyou can have a complex model. We can fit a complex cow like this on the trading data\non the right side. You can see that it’s having almost 0 error on the training data. So\nwhen you don’t visualize this, you can think of it that okay, my model is doing really great. Maybe I should just deploy it in a real world.\nBut if there was a point in the middle here, it will predict something which is very off\nthan the general trend.\nSo that’s what generalization means. You want the model to do good on an unseen example, and that’s why the middle curve\nis a good fit. It is not doing perfect. It’s not having perfect 0 training error, but it’s\nit’s better than the model on the right side, because it’s it will do well on an unseen example.\nAnd\nhere in 2D. It’s very easy to see. But when you have multiple features detecting these kind of scenarios is not trivial, and that’s why you need a structured way of doing this. So that’s why, whenever you are training a model, we always put aside some part of training data\nwhich is not used to train the model. And that’s called test set\nthe test set. You never use it for training. You only train the model on the training data. And then, after that, you\ntest the model on the unseen examples for which you already know the labels and quantify in some way how well the model is doing.\nSo this is how\nit would look like. If you have entire data set, you split it into training and testing set\nand on training set. You do everything, feature, extraction, training, and you work with different models to make sure that the training error is really low.\nYeah. And then finally, you evaluate on that test set.\nIf it’s working reasonably well on the test set, then you’re good to go. But if it’s not working well on the test set. That means you are most probably overfeeding. You need to go back and\ntweak your model training in such a way that\nyour training error actually increases so that it stops overfitting.\nthis part was, how do we actually evaluate the model. So accuracy is, I think, a very good example.\nLet me okay, that.\nAnd yeah, and the 5th section is like, Okay.\nhow do we? What are some ethical and societal challenges with machine learning?\nSo 1st is like, how do we collect the data that can? That may, requires some decisions which are ethically ambiguous. So\nfor for problems like chest X-ray classification.\nyou need doctors to classify every chest, X-ray image into whatever labels that you want.\nAnd this is kind of expertly annotated data. And it’s very expensive to get these kind of data.\nAnd recently, initially, what people were trying to do they were trying to have.\nThey were trying to tweak model design so that it works on a very limited set of data set.\nBut in later years what people have found is that having a larger data set\nis almost the only way to get better model\nat at some level. You are limited by your data, no matter how complex, how good your model design is. If you have a large amount of data, a simpler, easier model will always beat that.\nSo so yeah, that’s why\ndata is now new oil. That’s what many people believe. And that’s why big companies are trying to gather as much data as they want. And that’s why these are so powerful\npower.\nthis is an example of like how we should be careful what kind of data we use.\nSo so let’s say, someone wants to work on creating\ntraining a model which can generate dialogue of movies\nand your data set, you just use movies data set. But when you actually plot the statistics of the data set.\nyou may find that most of the dialogues are spoken by male characters.\nand then, if you train a model on this, the trained model will on it will most probably output dialogues which are spoken by male characters. So this is an example of bias on the data set which may creep into your trained model.\nYeah.\nAnd sometimes, if your data is not high quality of it doesn’t cover all the possible scenarios\nit can output really unwanted examples. And this is very interesting examples of the reinforcement learning model.\nSo the idea was the deep point. People were trying to train a reinforcement learning model\nin simulation that can learn how to walk on irregular terrain.\nAnd it was a reinforcement learning model, and it was trained using a reward system and reward was\nreward will be high if you can go far enough. That’s what that was the only reward.\nAnd yeah, this is how it worked.\nSo you can see that it’s going\nahead nicely. But there was no reward reward for penalizing other weird behavior of hands or something.\nSo yeah, for example, here\nit is, going ahead far, but hands are a bit weird. So these kind of behavior, if it’s not regularized. Well, if it’s if the reward structure is not enough.\nthen irregular behavior can creep into the modeling here itself.\nYeah.\nOkay?\nyeah.\nthere is another famous example of, there was a data video. Sorry, a vision question answering. So you give an image. You give your question, and the model should output the answer of the question\nand\nthe train model, when you input a green banana and ask, what what color is the banana? It always outputs yellow.\nbecause in the training data set, it always saw green bananas.\nSo it learned to associate banana with yellow color, irrespective of what the image is.\nSo yeah, 80% of the bananas are yellow in the training site.\nso yeah, these kind of biases can creep into. So biases sometimes can be harmless, but sometimes can be really harmful. So\nas a machine learning researcher or machine learning practitioner, if you become one, you should always be thinking about\nthe impact of rogue behavior of your model, and if it’s heavy, then maybe take extra care into that.\nan example workshop, and let’s directly go into the question outside.\nOkay, is there a specific line between good and under fit? Or is it more subjective?\nYeah, it is definitely subjective. So\nthe way we usually do is that, okay, we have a training error and validation. Error.\nusually validation, error, or testing error is always a bit higher than training. But we want to know whether we if we can still improve on that.\nSo we try to make the model more generalized.\nAnd so we try to make the model a bit more restrictive, but because of that, if even testing error goes high, then we know that. Okay, the model was already doing great. Maybe not. Let’s not force it to overgeneralize, and we can also go into other way. We try to make the model more over fit.\nand if it overfits here, but it also has the better validation error. That means, okay, we can still keep going higher and higher. So it’s basically subjective, based on what kind of evidences we get from the experiments.\nThe question is, is there actually a way to train an AI model to write stuff\nthat sounds totally like human? I mean, we have that we have chat gpt, right?\nI mean initially, the Chatgpt answers were pretty AI like. But right now\nthe answers are like really good human like, and if you prompt it in a way that if you prompt it in a way that okay, just sound more human like it will try to sound more casual and human like, so.\nyeah, how are Ml, biases made or developed?\nMl, biases, according to me, are\nthe 100% the product of what kind of data you use.\nThere are some ways where you have a model design which is more robust.\nBut people have found that if you try to make model\nmore general or fair enough, you always lose on its accuracy. So either you have a bad model.\nwhich is bias free, or if you have a good model which has some kind of bias.\nPeople always choose to have good model with some biases and try to correct the biases through training data, not the model design itself. So yeah.\nwhat is the generally the fastest form of machine learning, reinforcement, supervise, etc. Reinforcement learning is very slow.\nIt’s basically trial and error. You keep trying random things until you hit a good one with good reward.\nOn the other hand, in supervised learning, your model is directly told what the good action is so supervised. Learning is definitely the fastest one.\nBut there are some examples where\nthere are some scenarios where you don’t know. You don’t have the label data set, and the only way to do is is reinforcement learning.\nSo yeah, another example is like reinforcement can learn. Learning can find solutions which are really surprisingly good.\nI can give you an example of chat. Gpt so\nin chat Gpt after training. It’s fine tuned on examples of like different kind of things.\nConsider a math solving a math problem\nin supervised learning. You will need data of every kind of math problem and every different type of steps to solve it. But it’s generally not enough in reinforcement. Learning. What you can do is you can just let the model run on itself. Ask it to think about how to approach a problem, and whenever it hits a good solution you reward it with a high reward.\nIn this way you are\ntraining a model in a way that it will. It is generating good behavior, of solving a math problem by itself, and it’s not possible through supervised learning. And that’s why the deep seek model\nwhich came out very recently, it was able to do really well sometimes better than chat Gpt on many tasks because it was\nfine-tuned with reinforcement learning. And it it was able to get some really good solutions to many problems\nare traditional machine learning models still relevant today with deep learning becoming more advanced.\nYes. So the deep learning is basically, you have bigger model with deeper model. And you train it on lots of data set.\nBut when you don’t have enough data set.\nthen traditional machine learning is still useful because traditional machine learning is still made to work on low amount of data. So it problem specific.\nBut I would say, if you can gather more data.\nthen just gather more data. It’s always better.\nYeah.\nOkay. Is there a place where we can access the slides later?\nI’m not sure. Maybe I can ask Mariam about that. I’m happy to provide the slides. But\nBrooklyn, can we provide the slide.\n01:04:51\n01:05:01\nOkay, cool, cool. Then, yeah, I don’t have problem. With that, I’ll just check with a couple of other people who contributed to meet slides, and I’ll provide that.\nCan we explain why a model made a certain prediction? Do they have an option to show their thought process?\nThis is a very good question. Deep learning model in general, they are black box.\nIf they make a decision, we don’t know why\nwhy it was the case, if they make a bad decision, we don’t know why it was the case.\nThere are some techniques where you can sometimes figure out.\nWhat part of the input data led to that decision.\nBut we don’t know how to correct that.\nSo deep learning models are in general a black box. And that’s 1 of the problem\nagainst a rule-based system in rule-based system. You always know.\nwhere the model went wrong. But in deep learning, most probably not.\nWould machine learning algorithms typically use a greedy algorithm. And if so, how would they avoid being caught in a local minima situation? I think this question is out of the scope of this lecture. But\nthe short answer is, Yes,\nIt always goes to a local minimum. But there are ways to formulate your model design and your training in such a way that even if it goes to a local minimum, it’s a good local minimum that you are happy with.\nAnd since models are bigger, the solution space is usually very big. There are lots of parameters. There are multiple configurations of parameters which will give you a good model. And if you’re training during training, if you can find a good one, then it’s good enough.\nWhat’s the best way to address bias and fairness in Ml.\nit’s a big area of research. And\nI mean, traditionally, people tried doing that in an algorithmic way.\ntrying to design a machine learning model which naturally does not have bias. But\nright now, I think train data is the only way.\nI think the better research question might be, how can you create data set without bias and fairness in. Ml, so.\nyou know, there are a lot of questions on biases. I mean, in my slides there is a talk from timid Gabrew. It’s a really good talk on biases on in machine learning. So maybe you can check that out\nas a student, what are the best way to access high quality data set for training machine learning models?\nBut Kegel, as people have mentioned, Kaggle and hugging face have some really good data set, and some of the data sets that we use for benchmarking the model and the method they are typically available publicly, so you can just download. But for fun examples, I think Kegel and hugging face is a good way to go.\nFor example, in one of the assignments here in A at the course at Stanford.\nWe wanted students to create a tiny image generation model. And we found a data set from, I think, Kaggle.\nabout emojis. So data set of emojis, it’s small enough. It’s simple enough that you can train a model. So\nis just one example of how you can try small. But fun projects through data sets on Kaggle.\nokay, is all data manually labeled by people. If your problem requires that, then, yes.\nIs there a more convenient method on some problems? Unfortunately, no.\nSo yeah, that’s why, like some companies which specialize in\nlabeling the data, they have good tools which make labeling faster. But yeah.\ndo you think it will ever be possible to completely eliminate bias from AI? Wow! This is a good question\nthat\nsince Agi, or like models, are becoming as closer to the human intelligence, this question is very similar to can there be a very neutral, perfect human.\nIt’s as hard of a question as this.\nWhat we can do is like.\nI don’t think they’ll be perfectly neutral or bias less. AI.\nWe can only try to push it to be as bias free as possible, just like education system tries to\ninstill, like as many good values in students as they can. So it’s something like that.\nOkay, excess of slides. So okay, so yeah, we’ll provide the slides. So that question is answered.\nhow can you control the bias in so unsupered model, where you can’t control what features the model picks from the training data.\nThat’s true. So the question here is\nokay, just to get just to give an overview. So\nderiving features and training. A simpler model was the traditional way of doing Ml, but right now, with bigger data set and bigger compute.\nWhat we do is like, we just give the raw data to the model and let itself. And it’s a bigger model. So we let itself figure out how to classify or how to predict the correct label.\nSo\nbecause of that model might pick up good or bad things so, and there are many famous examples of spurious biases. So.\nfor example.\nthere was a question of detecting camel versus cow. But in the data set examples of cow are always in a green field, and examples of camels are always in a desert. So when you give an example of a cow in a desert, then it predicts camel. So these are kind of spurious correlations that what we call but\nyeah, and we are just giving model the example. And it’s trying to figure out itself.\nPeople have tried different examples. But again, the only way that worked was giving more data.\nYeah.\nokay, when Agi is reached will what will ultimately distinguish us, make us human man. That’s a deep question.\nvery philosophical question.\nis there a way we can access your slides after lecture? Yes, I’ll provide. The slides.\nOkay, that’s the end of all the questions.\nby the way, if you want to speak up your question, you can just unmute yourself and speak up. But\nyeah.\n01:12:59\nGreat. Thank you so much. Yes. Is there any last call for a question that comes from a student who would like to come off mute.\nOkay, we hear, I see Rohan raising your hand. Go for it.\n01:13:16\nSorry. So yeah. For when using like, smaller, efficient Nlp models, how do you balance making the model like easy to understand, but also like making sure it’s accuracy is like high, especially for like finance, like healthcare, and like those important.\n01:13:32\nThere he is.\nWhen you say, easy to understand. Do you mean you want the model to be\nexplainable in the sense that you want to know why the model is doing wrong decisions.\n01:13:44\nWell, I guess.\nin that sense, but also in the sense where it’s able to be understood by like the non technical people as well\nlike or not as technical.\n01:13:54\nI see. And they’re saying, like, you have limited data.\nagain, I think the question is a bit broad. But what works best is, start with a very strong model.\nand then provide your data as an very limited example, very limited set of example, with all the instructions that you can.\nSo, because if you start from a small model which is not trained already, it will likely to overfit. So it’s best to start with a strong, bigger model, but which which is well trained, and then carefully tune it to your case.\nThat usually works better.\n01:14:41\nAlright. Thank you.\n01:14:43\nNo problem. Thanks for the question. Yeah, will there be any way for us to reach out more question in future with email or Linkedin.\nI mean, I’m not sure if Ea, for all, has an official way of reaching out. But to me you can just reach out to me personally. I’ll try to answer best as I can.\nSo yeah.\n01:15:05\nIf you if you end up having a question, you’d like to address to the speaker. Specifically, you can always send it to us, and then we can direct it to the speaker or connect to you that way.\nYeah, like.\n01:15:21\nPerfect. Well, thank you so much for your time this morning for spending so much time and so much of your brilliant expertise with us and our students. It was a true pleasure to just get some insight into the work that you do. And yeah, all of your areas of expertise. You’ll see a lot of thank yous coming in the chat. Yeah, again. Thank you. And we look forward to connecting with you offline again.\n01:15:50\nSure.\nAnd yeah, thanks for inviting me. And thanks for all the interesting questions.\n01:15:54\nYeah, that’s\nyou handled them beautifully. We are going to go ahead and take a break right now. But before I will go ahead and put in all of the links to your group lectures in the chat. So these will be the Zoom Meeting links that you’ll be in next. We’re going to start them at 11. So you have a good 14 min or so to go to the restroom, get some water, just take care of\nyour needs and then be back here following those zoom links for your group projects. You’ll be meeting with your graduate mentors at that time.\nSo thank you so much, everybody, and we’ll see you after your break.\n01:16:34\nThank you.\n01:16:35\nThank you all.

Breaking down the MIT study”:\n\nThe video examines an MIT study that investigates if using AI tools like ChatGPT reduces people’s ability to think critically, retain information, or learn effectively.\nThe study found that people who relied solely on AI to complete tasks tended to retain less information and struggled more with recalling details later, compared to those who did the work themselves or used traditional search tools.\nOutsourcing cognitive tasks to AI can lead to a decline in the skills being outsourced, such as synthesizing information and problem-solving.\nThe video and its commenters highlight that while AI can boost productivity and help with routine tasks, over-reliance may make users dependent and less capable when AI is unavailable.\nSome viewers and the host argue that the impact depends on how AI is used: as a tool for checking or enhancing work, it can be beneficial, but as a crutch for doing all the thinking, it can be detrimental.\nThe discussion also touches on the importance of engagement and effort in learning—AI cannot replace the need for active thinking if deep understanding is the goal.\nThe video concludes that AI is not inherently making people “dumb,” but its effects depend on user habits and the context in which it is used. ​⁠\n"},"03_resources/the-“tortured-genius”-trope---House,-Rick":{"title":"the “tortured genius” trope - House, Rick","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The video critiques the “tortured genius” trope, using Dr. House and Rick Sanchez as examples, and argues that idolizing such characters can be harmful because their intelligence is used to excuse toxic behavior.\nKey Points\n\nThe “tortured misanthropic genius” archetype is common in media, with characters like Dr. Gregory House and Rick Sanchez embodying it. Their intelligence is often portrayed as both a blessing and a curse, isolating them from others but also allowing them to solve problems others cannot. \nFor Dr. House, his cynicism and refusal to trust anyone make him a better doctor in some cases, as shown in the “Maternity” episode where his suspicion leads to solving a medical mystery. \nRick Sanchez’s genius is driven by trauma and loss, leading to a nihilistic worldview. He treats even his family as replaceable, except for Morty, whom he keeps close for personal reasons related to revenge. \nBoth characters avoid consequences for their bad actions because their unique abilities make them indispensable. House’s medical brilliance protects him from being fired despite his misconduct, while Rick’s intelligence allows him to escape any threat, even by switching realities. \nThe video criticizes this trope, suggesting it can inspire antisocial behavior and superiority complexes in viewers, rather than serving as a cautionary tale. \nIn reality, the video argues, true mastery and achievement require collaboration and emotional health, not isolation and dysfunction. The “tortured genius” myth is misleading because, in real life, no one is so talented that their flaws should be excused or that they can succeed without support. \nThe video does appreciate that these characters show that perfectionism is not the source of genius—adaptability, learning from mistakes, and resilience are more important. Both House and Rick frequently make mistakes but quickly adapt and improve, which is presented as a more realistic aspect of genius. \nThe main takeaway: idolizing the “tortured genius” is problematic, and real success comes from working with others and managing one’s own issues, not from being above consequences.\n"},"04_permanent/Dimension_C-137":{"title":"Dimension_C-137","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nThey say my mind is held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.\n-Mr Goldmanbachmajorian\n\n\nDimension C-137 is one of the many universes in the multiverse was born and grew up. This is one of many dimensions where Rick’s wife Diane and daughter Bethwere killed when Beth was a child, and as a result, Summerand Morty never existed. Before it was revealed that the Rick and Morty we follow in the show are each from different dimensions, “Dimension C-137” was thought, including by Morty himself, to refer to the Prime Dimension where our Morty originated and the first six episodes of the TV series took place.\nRick returns to this dimension in “Solaricks”, where it is revealed he kept the entire dimension on a time loop of the day he lost Beth and Diane, leaving its inhabitants trapped for decades. As part of his effort to move on, Rick gets rid of the time loop, giving his neighbor Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian, and likely most of Earth’s population, the relief of death.\n\n\nThey say my mind is held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.\n—\nThe “time loop” suggests that the person is mentally and emotionally trapped, constanly reliving the trauma.\nThe “formidable intelligence” symbolizes the overwhelming power of the traumatic memory or the mind’s coping mechanism, which keeps the person stuck in that moment, unable to move on.\nThe mention of the “captor” forgetting about aging indicates that while the mind or soul remain trapped in the past, the physical body continues to deteriorate with time, enduring life under such relentless psychological strain.\nThe imagery of being “caught like a fly in amber” evokes a sense of being preserved in a state of suspended animation, unable to escape or progress, always fixed on that memory. The trauma encases and immobilizes the soul.  (amber is a fossilized tree resin that can preserve small creatures that became stuck in it for millions of years)\nThe mental imprisonment, the inescapable nature of trauma, and the longing for release from suffering."},"04_permanent/VIM":{"title":"VIM","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"04_permanent/Value-of-Statistical-Life":{"title":"Value of Statistical Life","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"ethical weighing\nmoral calculus\nbenefit-cost analysis\nthere are lies, damned lies, and statistics lmao\nThe Ethical Algorithm\nrelative worth of different outcomes.\nIn the scientific literature, these estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks are often referred to as the “value of a statistical life.”\nconstant and a variable\nex.\nconstant is the work you do, it has value, and it will be compromised if the person goes to jail\nvariable, Value of Statistical Life\nthe person’s VSL versus the witness’s VSL.\nthe witness’s VSL is lower, so its justified to kill her because the person will be greater for society in some terms.\nyou can’t put a price on a life\nevery department in our government has a VSL\nEPA’s is 10 million\nFDA&#039;s is 7.9 million\nThe Department of Transportation’s is $6.4 million\ntake the DOT as an example, the annoying beep that goes off when the people in the front seat don’t put their seatbelts on? ever wonder why there was no beep for the people sitting in the back?\nIt would cost them 325 million a year, but only save 44 lives.\n325 divided by 44 is 7.4 million\nBut since DOT values each life at only $6.4 million, they do not do that.\nanother example\norgan recipient protocols\nwhat a teacher makes versus a hedge fund manager.\nanother example could be a boss of a company, although the boss provides jobs to 10,000+ people, an environmental activist could have almost the same VSL as the boss as the environmental activist has a significantly less carbon footprint than the boss, as the boss uses private jets all the time. the environmental activists also gives and brings hope to younger generations, preserving our world and just uplifting people. for the boss’s VSL to go over the environmental activists’s hope/uplifting VSL, the boss just needs to make more money.\nanother example is SCIE, we do not have curtains to cover the windows in the event of an active shooter.
